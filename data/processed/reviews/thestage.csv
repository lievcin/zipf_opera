The subject is taken from a novel by the Chilean writer Roberto Bolano, who died in Spain in 2003.The Skating Rink describes how Enric, a middle-aged civil servant in a Spanish seaside town, conceives a passion for Nuria, a local figure skater, and embezzles funds to create for her a skating rink in a deserted palace. How his romantic but nefarious scheme eventually unravels provides the narrative, seen from his perspective as well as, earlier in the piece, from those of Gaspar, a local night-watchman, and Remo, a businessman who has an affair with Nuria; the result turns into a mystery with a whodunnit element.Sawer’s setting of Rory Mullarkey’s libretto maintains clarity and his score combines immediacy with pace: there’s a particularly magical sequence when skater Alice Poggio takes to the ice as Nuria (the role is sung by Lauren Zolezzi) and Sawer’s music soars in lyrical flight; but overall it’s a piece whose qualities will be quickly grasped by the audience. Garry Walker conducts the Garsington Opera Orchestra in a taut and cohesive performance.Stewart Laing both directs and designs the set. The result is finely observed,  offering a view of the underbelly of Spanish life that tourists never see: the sleaziness of local politicians, the desire to tidy the place up by removing vagrants, the general dissatisfaction of the locals with life on the Costa Brava.The cast is consistently strong, with standouts from Susan Bickley’s earthy Carmen, a former opera singer on her uppers, Alan Oke’s dysfunctional Rookie, and especially Grant Doyle as cheesy, desperate Enric.Falstaff review at Garsington Opera, Buckinghamshire – ‘warmth and humanity’"

Its production of Cosi Fan Tutte will be traversing the country again in the autumn.Lively and convincingly detailed, it benefits from the hand of an experienced director, Ptolemy Christie, who wisely keeps the standard comic-opera shtick to a minimum.Having adhered closely to da Ponte’s ambiguity-ridden libretto, in the final moments he introduces a twist: the duped sisters, Fiordiligi and Dorabella, both give the cynical and manipulative Don Alfonso a good slap and walk purposefully offstage, leaving their lovers behind.In Leah Sams’ design, with its readily portable décor of garlands and bistro furniture, the costumes suggest the 1930s and Ferrando’s and Guglielmo’s disguise evokes Ottoman style.In vocal terms, the six singers perhaps don’t comprise an ideally-matched ensemble, but all of them give astute performances, making pointed use of the text – the opera is given in Italian with surtitles.The Latin thrust of Robert Barbaro’s stylish Ferrando contrasts with the relative reserve of Fletcher’s soft-grained baritone as Guglielmo, while there is little sisterly resemblance between the mellow hues of Phillipa Thomas’ Dorabella and the incisive tones of Hopkins’ confidently articulated Fiordiligi.Honey Rouhani sparkles as the sassy Despina (genuinely hard to recognise when she enters as a jump lead-toting ‘doctor’) and James Williams makes a suavely resonant Don Alfonso.There is no orchestra, but Janet Haney handles a piano reduction of the score with pace and panache."
2,La Traviata review at Longborough Festival Opera – ‘awkward Hollywood farce’,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2018/la-traviata-review-longborough-festival-opera/,La Traviata,Longborough Festival Opera – ‘awkward Hollywood farce’,La Traviata review at Longborough Festival Opera,3,2018-07-03,Amanda Holloway,"Longborough Festival Opera’s theatre-in-a-barn (clad in Classical columns and with seats instead of hay bales) is known for excellent Wagner productions on a shoestring.After a successful Flying Dutchman comes a brash, 20th-century media setting of La Traviata, directed by Daisy Evans. She imagines Verdi’s courtesan Violetta as a Hollywood movie star addicted to drugs and parties, and her lover Alfredo as a rich besotted fan. But the analogy adds nothing to Verdi’s perfectly plotted original and the idea of staging the first act on a cluttered movie set is the stuff of Rossini comedies.Anna Patalong’s Violetta is inspired by Marilyn Monroe, though she looks more like a young Callas. Her dark-hued soprano smoulders and sobs and her dying scene is suitably affecting if only she weren’t lying at the front of the stage where most of the audience can’t see her. The constant clowning of the minor characters and the melodramatic emoting of tenor Peter Gijsbertsen as Alfredo and Mark Stone as Germont rob us of sympathy for their emotional turmoil.The big voices sometimes override the small orchestra but the simplicity and clarity of the orchestral lines come as a welcome respite. Conductor Thomas Blunt does well to keep in contact with the scattered chorus, which makes a powerful sound for such small forces.At the core of La Traviata is a chamber opera, ideal for a small theatre like Longborough. Evans could have created a genuinely intimate experience, rather than this awkward Hollywood farce."
3,"Don Giovanni review at Royal Opera House, London – ‘a thrilling ride’",https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2018/don-giovanni-review-royal-opera-house-london-2/,Don Giovanni,Royal Opera House,London,4,2018-07-02,Amanda Holloway,"Swirling images of naked women, conquests catalogued in ghostly handwriting on palace walls – the video designs by Luke Halls take us deep inside the head of serial seducer Don Giovanni.Director Kasper Holten sees Giovanni as a haunted man trying to escape from his emptiness by chasing pleasure. If he stops, it all comes crashing down – as indeed it does in the last act. No physical hell for the seductive, feline figure of Mariusz Kwiecien, just a small man on an empty stage looking into the black auditorium.Kwiecien is rapacious and ubiquitous; he stalks his prey, weaving in and out of Es Devlin’s Escher-like mansion, with its doors and staircases offering hiding places to the ghosts of lovers and Willard W White’s sepulchral Commendatore. Even the luscious, rippling soprano of Rachel Willis-Sorensen as Donna Anna and Hrachuhi Bassenz’s winning Elvira, both in exquisite gowns by Anja Vang Kragh, cannot save Giovanni from his demons.Holten seems less interested in relationships than the individual turmoil of his characters – couples rarely touch or stand together and even the pert manipulator Zerlina (Chen Reiss) and her doltish Masetto (Anatoli Sivko) sing the flirtatious Batti, Batti from opposite sides of the stage. There’s no connection between Kwiecien’s Giovanni and the Leporello of Ildebrando D’Arcangelo, whose stately bass-baritone doesn’t lend itself to comedy. Pavol Breslik makes much of the thankless role of Don Ottavio and his Il Mio Tesoro was genuinely moving.Not everything in this frantic production illuminates the opera, but it’s a thrilling ride thanks to the excellent singing.The orchestra played well, but conductor Marc Minkowski’s speeds made problems of ensemble on the first night, rather than creating a sense of excitement."
4,"Pelleas et Melisande review at Glyndebourne, Lewes – ‘a confusing production’",https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2018/pelleas-et-melisande-review-glyndebourne-lewes/,Pelleas et Melisande,Glyndebourne,Lewes,2,2018-07-02,George Hall,"Last month the Grange Festival opened a production of Handel’s Agrippina in sets that repeatedly referenced the venue itself and its recent history. Now, at Glyndebourne, Stefan Herheim presents Pelleas et Melisande in a staging whose main visual elements are openly borrowed from the Organ Room at the country house itself. It’s all starting to look a bit solipsistic.Herheim’s production has other problems, too. Set around the time of the opera’s composition in the 1890s, it adds further levels of the enigmatic and the mysterious – not to mention the downright obscure – to a scenario already steeped in such things.Why do the white-haired beggars discovered by Pelleas and Melisande sleeping in the cave become servants carrying artists’ easels? Why does an apparition of Jesus as the Good Shepherd suddenly materialise at an over-populated family dinner? Why does Golaud sexually assault his small son Yniold? Similar curiosities abound.Though it’s no-one’s fault, it didn’t help the first night that due to a throat infection bass Brindley Sherratt was unable to sing the role of Arkel, which he acted while Richard Wiegold gave an unsurprisingly rough-hewn account of the part from the auditorium. And in an opera whose lightly sung vocal lines would benefit from Francophone singers, there’s just one – Chloe Briot’s Yniold – in the entire cast.All of this compromises a performance whose most significant assets are the fluid and observant conducting of Robin Ticciati and the subtle and regularly luminous tone-colours provided by the London Philharmonic Orchestra – on marvellous form this season.For the rest, there’s superior singing from Karen Cargill’s Genevieve, a solid but rarely commanding Golaud from Christopher Purves, an enthusiastic Pelleas from John Chest and a skilful but oddly disengaged Melisande from Christina Gansch, all of whom would undoubtedly make a stronger impression in a better staging.Giulio Cesare review at Glyndebourne, Lewes – ‘a memorable revival’"
5,Powder Her Face review at Nevill Holt Opera – ‘rises to brilliance’,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2018/powder-her-face-review-nevill-holt-opera/,Powder Her Face,Nevill Holt Opera – ‘rises to brilliance’,Powder Her Face review at Nevill Holt Opera,4,2018-06-29,George Hall,"For the second production of its first season in its new opera house, Nevill Holt takes on a modern classic and presents it to a level few UK companies could match.To a mordantly witty libretto by Philip Hensher, Powder Her Face was the piece that put composer Thomas Ades on the operatic map when it premiered in 1995; and the complex appeal of this tragi-comedy based on the life of the scandalous 20th-century socialite Margaret, Duchess of Argyll continues unabated.One fault is arguably technical – not enough of the text comes through. Surtitles would undoubtedly help.But Antony McDonald’s stylish production charts impeccably the central character’s rise and fall from divorced former debutante and rich girl to an elderly woman thrown out of her grand hotel because she has no money left to pay the bill.The innumerable other characters who encounter her on her up-and-down trajectory – brilliantly played here by Irish soprano Daire Halpin, British/Australian tenor Adrian Dwyer and bass-baritone Stephen Richardson – may mock and excoriate her as she crashes to earth in the most undignified manner possible, but in the end one feels for the Duchess.Arguably somewhat soft-grained vocally for such an unashamedly hard-edged woman, soprano Mary Plazas takes on this starring role, and in terms of physicality – especially those facial expressions which this small venue allows the audience to see – she lays all the human dimensions of a flawed but proud individual before us. Her interpretation is a true tour-de-force.But then so is the orchestral performance from the Britten Sinfonia – resident at Nevill Holt for the first time – under young conductor Ian Ryan, who together relish the parodies and the collective memories of Richard Strauss and Berg in a musical account that shows Ades’ mastery of the medium at its considerable height."
6,"La Boheme review at Royal Opera House, London – ‘an unforgettable portrayal of Musetta’",https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2018/la-boheme-review-royal-opera-house-london-2/,La Boheme,Royal Opera House,London,4,2018-06-27,George Hall,"Puccini’s most popular work – indeed the most popular piece in the entire operatic repertoire these days – La Boheme returns in Richard Jones’ pared down production.Pared down, that is, apart from the second act, when the Cafe Momus erupts in a whirl of hyperactivity, with three shopping arcades sliding on and off, and an unusually glamorous restaurant – surely far above the Bohemians’ most optimistic pockets – provides the evening with a brilliant set-piece of top-quality stagecraft.Here, too, Danielle de Niese launches her unforgettable portrayal of Musetta, a complex, unhappy and in this scene distinctly drunk individual whose antics nevertheless have the audience eating out of her hand. She clearly understands the young woman in some depth, as later scenes reveal.By her side Maria Agresta offers a classic Italian lyric soprano as Mimi, and like De Niese she shows us an individual of genuine strength, and not merely the kind of ‘little woman’ Puccini is still sometimes accused of portraying. Her tone is varied and sensitively deployed.These high-quality performances are matched by American tenor Matthew Polenzani’s buoyant, stylishly sung Rodolfo and Etienne Dupuis’ firm but volatile Marcello. Duncan Rock’s happy-go-lucky Schaunard and Fernando Rado’s vocally solid and emotionally sombre Colline flesh out the Bohemian quartet. Smaller roles are in the safe hands of Jeremy White as a gullible Benoit and Wyn Pencarreg as a put-upon Alcindoro.Nicola Luisotti conducts an interpretation that could do with keener rhythmic attack and more momentum generally, but which is often beautifully observed at a local level. He draws fine tone and shapely phrasing from the orchestra, while the chorus throw themselves into their big Act II scene with obvious relish.La Boheme review at Royal Opera House, London – ‘Richard Jones’ successful new staging’"
7,"The Turn of the Screw review at Open Air Theatre, London – ‘palpable dramatic charge’",https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2018/turn-screw-review-opera-open-air-theatre-london/,The Turn of the Screw,Open Air Theatre,London,4,2018-06-26,Yehuda Shapiro,"Ahead of its production of Little Shop of Horrors, Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre stages a subtler and more sinister musical chiller, equally well suited to this verdant setting.Directed by the Open Air Theatre’s artistic director Timothy Sheader, this production of The Turn of the Screw is the result of a new partnership with English National Opera, which fields two casts for the nine performances.Predictably, Sheader makes creative use of the wide open spaces. Soutra Gilmour’s design places a dilapidated glasshouse amidst an overgrown garden. A raised wooden walkway and a ramshackle piano nestle in the grass.The singer of the Prologue (William Morgan) is planted in the audience and the ghosts (Elgan Llyr Thomas as the auburn-mopped Quint, Elin Pritchard as the heavily pregnant Miss Jessel) enter through the auditorium. The children, Miles and Flora (Daniel Alexander Sidhom and Elen Willmer) have plenty of room to leap and play.The downside is that a growing sense of claustrophobic panic becomes harder to evoke. Perhaps, too, Sheader renders the ghosts too robust and corporeal. There is even the suggestion of an ectoplasmic threesome with the Governess.The voices are skilfully amplified, retaining some natural acoustic resonance, but the score’s more diaphanous moments are compromised by the miking of the 13-strong instrumental ensemble, placed at the back of the greenhouse.The most memorable moment comes in Act II as dusk descends on the theatre and the Governess is alone with Miles, who by this point appears both vulnerable and malign. The scene is both touching and unnerving.In the course of the opera Sidhom seems to evolve into adolescence – or perhaps premature adulthood – before our eyes, while Willmer’s poised Flora is both captivating and spiteful. Janis Kelly’s Mrs Grose might not be warmly maternal of tone, but she is utterly persuasive as she gradually resigns herself to disaster.As the Prologue, William Morgan (Quint in the alternate cast) immediately collars the audience with his lively presence and pliant tenor, while Thomas’s Quint duly dominates the action with his interventions: his sound is both lean and ringing and he exudes a natural confidence. Pritchard brings rich, shining tone to Miss Jessel, here more an enigmatic than tragic figure, suggestive of a fairy tale with her implausibly long, thick plait of hair.The central figure, the Governess, is sung here by Anita Watson. The gentle radiance of her soprano and the unforced clarity of her diction (there are no surtitles) are matched by an economical, but always eloquent physical performance. Her smile speaks volumes.Conducting, Toby Purser ratchets up the tension over the two hours and the denser textures of the closing scenes fill the air with a palpable dramatic charge."

The jokes may be old ones and could be snappier, but in Tim Reed’s equally traditional designs this is a good-looking show that does more or less what it says on the tin.The singing is always solid if rarely special. Tenors Ed Lyon as Belmonte and Paul Curievici as Pedrillo are somewhat similar in vocal character and approach, both giving clean-cut accounts of their roles without offering much in the way of subtlety.In the high-flying soprano roles of Konstanze and her English maid Blonde respectively, Kiandra Howarth and Daisy Brown hit all their notes fair and square and once again present straightforward interpretations of their characters.Making stronger impressions are bass-baritone Jonathan Lemalu as a grand-scale Osmin who savours the comic possibilities of his role, and actor Alexander Andreou in the spoken role of Pasha Selim – a character to whom he brings considerable humanity and dignity.The conductor is Jean-Luc Tingaud, who keeps up the Mozartian momentum and maintains order in the pit, where the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra are on excellent form.There’s much more to Mozart’s opera than is sought here, of course, and if finally this feels like a nostalgic evening then it will nevertheless bring much pleasure.The Barber of Seville review at Grange Festival, Hampshire – ‘witty and entertaining’"
9,"Romeo et Juliette review at Grange Park Opera, Surrey – ‘a lack of chemistry’",https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2018/romeo-et-juliette-review-grange-park-opera-surrey/,Romeo et Juliette,Grange Park Opera,Surrey,3,2018-06-25,George Hall,"Charles Gounod’s second most popular opera (after Faust), Romeo et Juliette suffers from the composer falling in love with the sheer loveliness of his own music and simply going on too long rather than cutting to the dramatic chase.But beautiful his delicate, Pre-Raphaelite score certainly is, especially as stylishly played by the English National Opera Orchestra, on pristine form under conductor Stephen Barlow, who understands the need for Gallic lightness in the textures.Near ideal, too, are Francis O’Connor’s designs, which move the story to 1930s Italy, with the Capulets a black-shirt gang and the Montagues a looser assembly of freer spirits. David Plater’s canny lighting makes the clear lines of O’Connor’s uncluttered sets and characteristically Italian fashion-conscious costumes look marvellous.Vocally, the central performances are pretty good. Ukrainian soprano Olena Tokar engages passionately with Juliette, though she lacks a proper trill and her top register can turn strident. Korean tenor David Junghoon Kim is more consistent, effortlessly producing fine tone and shaping Gounod’s lines with sensitivity.The problem is that they show little interest in each other, which is fatal for an opera that depends on their mutual adoration. Kim, indeed, needs to develop his physical acting, which is currently no match for his high-quality vocalism.Showing them the way are several of the rest of the cast, with Clive Bayley demonstrating just what potential there is in a secondary role like Capulet and Anthony Flaum a vital Tybalt.As Frere Laurent Mats Almgren needs better diction, but Anna Grevelius makes a good deal out of Stephano’s scene, Gary Griffiths proves a bright spark as Mercutio, and Olivia Ray discovers more than you might expect in Juliette’s nurse Gertrude. There’s top quality work throughout from the chorus, too, both vocally and dramatically.Oklahoma! review at Grange Park Opera, Surrey – ‘performed with unstoppable aplomb’"

Akilah Mantock sketches in the role of Hannah as a child.Though there’s a scene between the two characters that teeters momentarily on preachiness in its appeal for us to mend our ways, the opera’s general stance is spiritual, if necessarily troubled. The ending may feel more ambivalent than positive, but the journey on which the audience has been taken is undoubtedly worthwhile.Five operas ‘bashing about’ the classic art form this summer"

Waddington can and surely will go further with the role, but already the basis for an exceptional interpretation is there.The surround is largely excellent, with particular standouts from Yvonne Howard’s on-the-button Mistress Quickly, Oliver Johnston’s lyrical Fenton, Soraya Mafi’s entrancing Nannetta and especially Richard Burkhard’s furious Ford.Taken as a whole the evening brings us close to the heart of a comedy that proves – in the words of the final fugue – that life makes fools of us all.Die Zauberflote review at Garsington Opera, Wormsley – ‘an enigmatic staging’"

Yoel (countertenor Collin Shay) is a timid 21-year-old Hassid. On the night before his wedding he escapes to Manhattan from Brooklyn. Only it’s the sweltering summer of 1977 and all the lights go out.In the chaos he encounters a mysterious man (Steven Page) – just possibly a ghost – who leads him to a revelation about his family. He comes to understand the reasons for his confusion and achieves some kind of resolution.Composer Na’ama Zisser and her librettists pick up on the story’s Oedipus element by introducing a kind of Greek chorus – here a synagogue cantor (Netanel Hershtik). Of his seven numbers only one is by Zisser; the others, mostly conventionally and reassuringly tonal, date from the 20th century.Zisser’s own music is eclectic, sometime sparse, sometimes layered, sometimes hauntingly melodic. Recorded sound complements live performance (conductor Jessica Cottis and the Aurora Orchestra are in the pit) and the singers are discreetly amplified.The score’s highlight is a reflective trio for Yoel, his younger self (treble Edward Hyde) and his troubled mother (mezzo Gundula Hintz). Here, Zisser takes assertive command of her material, creating memorable music drama. Elsewhere she can slip into neutral, relying on the surtitles (which translate the Yiddish terms that pepper the English text) to tell the story.Jay Scheib’s production, set on a largely empty stage, makes striking use of live video and news footage. If it never quite evokes mid-1970s sweatiness, the theatrical intensity never falters."

Others – such as Grange Park Opera – have developed a genuine and ongoing interest in the form.Directed by Jo Davies with expensive-looking visuals by Francis O’Connor and Gabrielle Dalton, this year’s major revival of the 1943 Rodgers and Hammerstein Americana classic Oklahoma! is top of the Grange Park range.It also demonstrates a couple of advantages when full-scale opera companies take on such pieces: the 50-strong BBC Concert Orchestra sounds glorious under Richard Balcombe, while the casting of operatic baritone Phillip Rhodes gives Jud a weight and sympathy that reminds us how ambiguous the moral compass of this – at first sight – straightforward show really is.But the musical theatre casting has been equally expertly done. Dex Lee makes a charismatic Curly, his boundlessly good-natured performance founded on balletic skills in the celebrated dream sequence and absolute assurance with both text and notes: to match him Katie Hall treats Laurey as something a good deal more complex than apple-pie.If Ado Annie is a tricky role these days, then Natasha Cottriall does everything possible to make her human as well as funny, while in what is – astonishingly – his first professional performance, Louis Gaunt’s delightfully naive and once again expertly danced Will Parker is up there with the best.Claire Moore brings wit and warmth to every moment of Aunt Eller’s crucial linking role, while as the preposterous Ali Hakim – here the Persian pedlar has clearly travelled via Vienna – Steven Serlin misses nary a trick.The entire company, though, rises to all challenges thrown at them with unstoppable aplomb.

Cleverly designed, this is a good-looking Marriage of Figaro, with straightforward period costumes and a handsome and adaptable white unit set by Simon Kenny that provides all the requisite entrances and exits while suggesting a touch of Moorish influence in its Spanish architectural flavour.In Joe Austin’s staging the cast give a good idea of a piece with more plot per square inch that any other repertoire work.Rightly maintaining the centre of attention is the stage-savvy Figaro of American Lawson Anderson, whose solid bass-baritone provides the bedrock of a vital and consistently entertaining though never overplayed performance.Partnering him skilfully is Aoife Miskelly’s cleanly sung Susanna – a little too serious of demeanour, nevertheless, for a live wire comic role.Of the aristocratic couple, award-winning baritone James Newby’s firmly delivered Count is regularly frustrated by the machinations of his underlings in cahoots with Sky Ingram’s lyrically sentient Countess. Mezzo Anna Harvey offers a pleasingly sung account of the male role of Cherubino, though physically she remains resolutely female in stance and movement.Also making positive contributions to the busy intrigue are Joan Rodgers’ worldly-wise Marcellina and Stephen Richardson’s pragmatic Bartolo.But the palm for this successful launch has to go to conductor Nicholas Chalmers and the Royal Northern Sinfonia – the latter newly ensconced in the pit – who between them supply an ideal musical underlay, spirited in momentum and refined in texture: though a few more period-style vocal decorations would be welcome.Nevill Holt Opera’s Nicholas Chalmers: ‘Intimacy is our selling point.

Exhibiting good sightlines and clean, immediate acoustics, the evolving barrel-like structure this year sports fine external detailing with proper loos in a freestanding ‘lavatorium rotundum’.Notoriously, Calixto Bieito’s ENO version of Verdi’s A Masked Ball put 14 lavatories on stage. GPO’s, given in Italian with surtitles, eschews anything so radical. Instead, the team behind last year’s high-concept Die Walkure go for another period treatment, nudging the calendar modestly forward from 18th-century Sweden or colonial Boston (censorship forced Verdi himself to relocate) to a newly independent America of flags, uniforms, portraits and beards.Thanks to careful blocking and ambitious lighting, the action never feels undercooked for all that the set is a thinly disguised version of the galleried space deployed in the Wagner. Ulrica’s hut arrives as a separate downstage unit for Act I, Scene II.Riccardo is the much-touted, twentysomething Vincenzo Costanzo, his potentially resplendent if as yet rather small tenor occasionally drifting sharp. Tereza Gevorgyan shines in the trouser role of Oscar she sang previously with Opera North, her ambivalent secretary here reconfigured as boyish cowboy. Claire Rutter, last year’s accomplished Sieglinde, is a vibrant and dramatic Amelia.

It isn’t until some way into the first act that things start to ignite, largely thanks to excellent teamwork from the all-male chorus, sometimes sporting the effusive moustaches that are a leitmotif, even worked into the moveable indoor/outdoor set (a witty design by Andrew D Edwards).Costumes and props shift rapidly between eras, often to humorous effect, as when Bartolo, in 19th-century garb, reacts with puzzlement when handed a mobile phone, or when Almaviva ingratiates himself into the household dressed as a missionary, a la Book of Mormon. Less persuasive is the frequent breaking of the fourth wall, as when characters converse with David Parry while he conducts the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra in the pit.Charles Rice as Figaro is a charismatic presence right from his famous first aria, while David Soar as the heavyweight Don Basilio also boasts impressive talent. Riccardo Novaro has the right amount of befuddlement as Bartolo.Jose Maria Lo Monaco brings a vibrancy to Rosina; her suitor, Almaviva (John Irvin), has the required vocal suppleness but not the comedic timing. There’s a show-stopping aria from Jennifer Rhys-Davies as Berta, the chain-smoking maid with a dream or two."

His encounters with them and other individuals – in court, in a public gardens and a brothel – ameliorate his plight while also allowing some of Silverberg’s focused purity to dissipate.In the opera he also has a kind of shadow in the shape of what the libretto describes as The Other Invisible – Anna Dennis’ female soprano regularly in synch with Nicholas Morris’ baritonal male. The character’s dual vocality is undoubtedly one of the more successful features of Howard’s score.Ana Ines Jabares-Pita’s spartan sets and apt costumes work well, as does Dan Ayling’s surreal, dreamlike and occasionally nightmarish production.The cast are kept busy, five of them – all but the two Invisibles – switching skilfully back and forth between four characters each.Howard’s score is hard-edged and dense, at its best in the alternately truculent and subtle instrumental writing for the nine members of Birmingham Contemporary Music Group, astutely conducted by Richard Baker; there are moments in the vocal writing, though, that sound extremely awkward to negotiate. Musically, the result feels like a patchwork.Parodistic elements – the famous trio Soave sia il vento from Mozart’s Cosi fan tutte is quoted at length, alongside a lute song of Dowland’s – are mystifying, and at the end the success of the piece feels distinctly uncertain."

Other characters become birds or lions, but he is squashed by a rock and turned into a fountain.With help from John Gay, Handel turned the story into his first secular English drama, a pastoral opera with some great arias and a sad, tender finale.As part of English National Opera’s Studio Live season, which takes the might of the ENO into smaller spaces, its rehearsal studio has been kitted out with lurid fake grass and bright balloons, Justin Nardella’s design erasing the bucolic setting and instead creating the midsummer party of a trendy social media company.Director Sarah Tipple turns the opera on its head, making Acis and Galatea an image-obsessed couple constantly on their phones and Polyphemus a put-upon colleague who, humiliated online by Acis, kills him in a fit of rage.Alexander Sprague’s preening Acis is a great contrast to Matthew Durkan’s pitiable, lumbering Polyphemus, his mournful baritone a highlight of the show.Tipple has the cast constantly in action – hugging, bundling, playing penalty shootouts – which sometimes gets the better of the finer vocal detail, but reaches a high point when the ensemble does a conga line to the upbeat Happy We.The traverse staging and constant motion create a wonderful effect where some choral lines are pronounced depending on where each member of the ENO Chorus is on the stage. It creates a kind of surround sound, a mosaic of music that builds piecemeal in the head. It’s an effect that couldn’t possibly be recreated in traditional, huge end-on spaces.The update is a little laboured, but mostly it works well, erring on the side of silliness and putting Ovid’s story into a new context. The real treat, however, is experiencing the ENO chorus and a fine cast sing so brilliantly and so closely. "

Anna Stephany presented Cornelia’s hot-headed son Sesto with dramatic authority and complete vocal command. Korean countertenor Kangmin Justin Kim revealed star quality as he capered with conspicuous dexterity through Nireno’s routines, while American baritone John Moore brought thrilling vocalism and high-definition characterisation to Tolomeo’s treacherous general Achilla.Joelle Harvey sang and danced Cleopatra with terrific aplomb, though without being able to efface memories of De Niese in a role that was tailor-made for her in McVicar’s choreographically hyperactive staging.The production itself – certainly one of the director’s finest – retains its all-too-rare combination of intellectual rigour with unstoppable theatrical entertainment.Once again in charge of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, Christie remains a committed Handel interpreter, and if there’s a lingering doubt – as with other elements of the show – that the boundless energy evident back in 2005 has dissipated somewhat, enough endures to make this a noteworthy revival."

By composer Elena Langer and librettist Emma Jenkins, and with a brilliant all-female cast, creative team and 10-piece onstage ensemble conducted by Nicola Rose, the show is as maverick as its heroine.This is no serious feminist disquisition or sombre social biography. Ribald and irreverent, Rhondda’s story becomes an Edwardian-inspired music hall entertainment, narrated by fabulous male-impersonator MC, Lesley Garrett. Playing multiple roles, she and the gender-bending women of the WNO Chorus – with star turns from the audience-seated WNO Community Chorus – gleefully lampoon everything from the House of Lords to polite ladies’ tea parties and elocution lessons.Smartly directed by Caroline Clegg on Lara Booth’s wood-panelled set, the burlesque never overwhelms the purpose – nor delivery of words sung or spoken, as Langer’s delicate, imaginative score traverses jazz and popular styles with aplomb. Sudden mood shifts highlight the critical issues, with mezzo Madeleine Shaw proving a superb Rhondda, poignantly supported by singer-actor sisters.If the fetishisation of cakes, ballot boxes and penises raises eyebrows, perhaps the point is that – still, today – genuine equality remains elusive for women while conflicting stereotypes of humourless feminism and chick-lit triviality persist. Rhondda’s response is to rip up the rulebooks and magnificently thumb a nose."

Most of the cast are youngish up-comers; Agrippina herself – scheming wife of Emperor Claudio – is established star Anna Bonitatibus, supreme classiness oozing from every vocal phrase. Ostensibly a Machiavellian figure, it’s impossible not to root for her as she plots to instal her son Nero on the throne. With her stunning voice and sassy demeanour, Stephanie True’s hot pants-wearing Poppea is more than a spoilt sex-kitten – like Mozart’s Susanna, she’s a bright spark who ensures justice triumphs.Jon Bausor’s costumes are spot-on, from fay acolyte Narciso’s lilac trousers (James Hall) to Nero’s bejewelled t-shirts (Raffaele Pe, channelling Russell Brand).The tone is suitably irreverent, and thanks too to the excellent Academy of Ancient Music and Robert Howarth’s energetic conducting, the show zips happily along, all-but pitch-perfect. The last of too many blow-job jokes, accompanied by an Up Pompeii-esque swanee whistle, raises not even a titter, but that’s a rare misfire. If only all baroque opera was this entertaining. "

But Georg Zeppenfeld’s King Heinrich and Kostas Smoriginas’ Herald are of the requisite scale and quality to balance the show’s mixed vocal standards."

The titular sea-captain is condemned to sail the oceans in a state of limbo. Every seven years he is cast ashore; if he then finds a woman who pledges to be faithful to him, the curse will be lifted.Thomas Guthrie’s new production gives no inkling of the Dutchman’s and his prospective wife Senta’s need for each other (she has become fixated with him as a legendary figure). The stand-and-deliver approach is often executed such as to choke any meaningful interaction between the characters. This also goes for the earlier scene between Senta’s father Daland and the Dutchman. Here Daland (sung by Richard Wiegold) struggles to project any expression of character or feeling, while the Dutchman (Simon Thorpe) lacks presence and, in lower writing, occasionally veers off-course like his fateful vessel.Erik (Jonathan Stoughton, singing through an illness) sounded tired by Act III, but William Wallace sings the Steersman with power, if with a too-Italianate ring. Kirstin Sharpin is vocally in control as Senta, but Carolyn Dobbin’s Mary has the most beautiful voice: a brief but delicious encounter for the ear.Despite the wooden presentation, there are some nice touches to the production. Miniature chocolate-box houses, lit from within, convey a calm community disrupted by the new arrivals; the painted backdrops are atmospherically lit; and there’s an innovative stroke in the song of the Dutchman’s’ ghostly crew being prerecorded and heard over a transistor radio.The chorus is fresh and stimulating especially in Act III and the playing in the pit, under British Wagnerian Anthony Negus, is gutsy and disciplined, especially in the strings. But for them the lack of heart elsewhere would be hard to stomach."

The notoriously tricky ending is as convincing as any, though I’m not going to give it away.And yet Platt has not lost his sense of humour, as some directors do with this piece; the laughter might be wry, but it’s there in all the right places.In terms of individual performances, Mozart and Da Ponte’s naive young lovers are finely explored over the course of the show by four singers who lay all their ambiguities bare by means of expert vocalism. Eleanor Dennis’ complex Fiordiligi, Kitty Whately’s extrovert Dorabella, Nicholas Lester’s cocksure Guglielmo and Nick Pritchard’s sensitive Ferrando all sing their parts to a degree of excellence rarely encountered.Equally focused are Sarah Tynan’s savvy, sassy Despina and Peter Coleman-Wright’s unashamedly manipulative Don Alfonso.Occasionally Platt allows a little too much extraneous action – the three-handed opening doesn’t benefit from so many hyperactive extras on stage – but by and large such interventions are relatively harmless, the show’s nuanced intelligence serving the piece well.Equally impressive is the playing of the City of London Sinfonia – having a great season thus far – under Dane Lam, whose way with Mozart is unerringly sound and who encourages the cast to indulge in some delicious vocal decoration."

Andrew Shore stands up for the theatre that has been his life as the old director La Roche, with Hanna Hipp a bracing presence as the actress Clairon.Sam Furness and Gavan Ring relish their permanent stand-off as rivals composer Flamand and poet Olivier respectively, while Graham Clark delivers a superb cameo as the ancient prompter Monsieur Taupe, whom everyone needs but whom all have forgotten."

Reconciling all of these into one single show is a difficult task, and one not convincingly met by director/designer Netia Jones at Garsington.For Mozart and his librettist Schikaneder – who starred in the 1791 premiere as the bird-catcher Papageno, a comic personality role and the audience’s main point of contact with the piece – it was also a way of propounding elements of Freemasonry.Jones, indeed, goes further than most directors in consciously reflecting Masonic ritual in the later scenes, before successful initiates Tamino and Pamina finally reject the whole rigmarole of the sect in which they have become involved, inspiring all the other members to junk it as well. Jones’ visuals reference various historical periods, leaving the cult’s exact nature and purpose distinctly unclear, though it is certainly intent upon keeping women in their place.There’s perception and seriousness in her reading, but its focus gets lost in a welter of disparate and occasionally mystifying imagery; she also short-changes such vital elements as magic and humour, which need more of a look-in.Musically the evening is a good deal stronger, with no weak performances, even if Jonathan McGovern’s Papageno makes less headway than usual in winning over the audience’s affections – unsurprisingly given the distinctly muted characterisation presented.But Louise Alder’s flawlessly controlled Pamina, Sen Guo’s immaculately skilled Queen of the Night, Benjamin Hulett’s clean-edged Tamino and James Creswell’s richly flowing Sarastro all score highly in vocal terms.Christian Curnyn conducts the Garsington Opera Orchestra in a robust account of the score, but despite their efforts and those of the energetic Garsington chorus this is an evening that seems to discourage the audience from engaging directly with the piece."

There’s no neat answer. Jeff Clarke – who stages Iford’s production – admits that, like The Tales of Hoffmann, Candide has become “one of those works of which there will never be a definitive version”.Following its disappointing 1956 Broadway reception, the piece has been revamped on numerous occasions, and undoubtedly – 27 years after Leonard Bernstein’s death and 34 after Lillian Hellman’s – there will be further attempts to fix it.Bernstein himself was clear that what he had written was a comic operetta, and this production by an opera company with a cast split between opera singers and musical theatre specialists, plus some who do both, identified itself as the 1999 National Theatre version by John Caird.It is nevertheless too long, arguably sticking too closely to the endless succession of plot locations in which the perennially innocent Candide can (perhaps) learn yet more hard truths. Much of the material is, of course, fascinating, though not every single number maintains the composer’s highest level.Clarke is a master of comic direction, and his cast of 14 – some of them taking up to seven or eight roles each – throw themselves at each and every routine and stretch of dialogue; one or two fumbled lines reflect the sheer amount of material to be memorised.As co-designer with Elroy Ashmore, Clarke also ensures that the constantly changing sets suggest the more than a dozen countries through which we pass during the two-act show; he and Wanda D’Onofrio have raided his 25-year-old company’s costume store covering innumerable comic operas and operettas and come up with some plausible, fantastical creations.Iford’s experienced artistic director Oliver Gooch conducts 14 accomplished members of the Orpheus Sinfonia, and together they attack Bernstein’s regularly brilliant score with distinction."

Then a short-lived Butterfly takes flight in its aerial ballets. Finally, the quickfire Carmen scores with a police chase on trampolines, a bullfight-cum-Chinese dragon dance, and string stylings that carry a whiff of Old Havana.Where Trioperas betrays weakness is in the essentials of narrative and characterisation.With these eclectic reimaginings of favourite works, the protean Pamela Tan-Nicholson laudably wants to reach beyond the opera buffs. But a neophyte might have trouble knowing just what is going on.Each of the three sections, which contain no spoken dialogue, lasts just half an hour or so. Rather than paring things down to essentials, Tan-Nicholson wants to cover as much ground as possible while generating maximum visual excitement.Plot developments are often rushed or assigned out of the blue to a narrator or chorus. In Butterfly the all-important title character gets crowded out by incidental action and the supporting cast.Nor does it help that the amplification – of both voices and instruments – tends to overpower the (English) lyrics. The surtitles highlight the text’s reliance on obvious rhymes or locutions like “we would ourselves deny our joy”.The words do not always sit easily with the lines of Puccini and Bizet that Tan-Nicholson has chosen to retain. At the piano, she is a dynamic member of the instrumental ensemble and performances overall are committed and often exuberant, with especially strong showings from Lucy Kay, Chiara Vinci, Naoto Kaiho and Richard Munday."

The result is a remarkably complete depiction of the work’s central themes, handsomely conveyed in visual terms.So much in La Traviata depends on a sympathetic portrayal of the central character, the woman – to translate the title – has gone astray. Australian soprano Lauren Fagan takes on the dual challenge of singing and acting the complex role with accomplishment and authority, not merely singing the notes but expressing the feelings behind them, while her charting of the tubercular heroine’s steady physical decline is finely and movingly judged.Sardinian tenor Matteo Desole offers an Alfredo of warm humanity and vocal confidence. Baritone Stephen Gadd brings discrimination to his rounded portrayal of Alfredo’s father, Giorgio Germont.The smaller roles fit neatly into the wider picture, with Nicholas Garrett’s menacing Baron Douphol and Ellie Edmonds’ watchful Annina leaving particularly strong impressions.Musically, the performance takes a few minutes to settle, with some initially untidy ensemble; but once it does the strength and physical involvement of the Opera Holland Park Chorus and the tonal vitality of the City of London Sinfonia both shine through.Having risen through the ranks to enjoy a burgeoning career, Anglo-Ghanaian conductor Matthew Kofi Waldren shows a keen appreciation of the drama inherent in Verdi’s music."

But then the singing starts and all is forgiven.When Sarah Helena Foubert, as the older diva, summons her character through her singing much more fully and succinctly than through the acting. Her rich, imperious voice never sounds shrill even in this small room, and she duets expertly with Hazel McBain as the younger diva, the two of them harmonising perfectly on some very knotty and very high runs.In the second part, about two lovers who consult a “relationship guru” when they’re going through a rough patch, Wesley Biggs is pleasantly dotty and erratic as the charlatan love doctor Mr Colas, with a lovely smooth baritone to boot.The singing once again is wonderful, but the straining attempts at humour in between are overlong and annoying. Still, it’s hard not to admire the endeavour. Quality opera on a shoestring is no mean feat, especially when the singers are this strong. "

This makes La Traviata an apt – if ambitious – choice for a small opera company that aims to put young singers in the spotlight.In Sophie Gilpin’s production – set in the mid-1960s and even discreetly referencing Antonioni’s film Blow-Up – Violetta, her lover Alfredo and their social circle really are people in their twenties. This heightens the sense of youthful recklessness that is a driving force in the opera.The central role is notoriously demanding, even for a mature soprano. Eleanor Ross initially over-pressures her bright voice in the close-up acoustic of Jacksons Lane Theatre, but she sings with élan and a natural dramatic charge. Her transition from mercurial party girl to loving, but doomed woman rings painfully true.There is convincing chemistry between her and the Alfredo of Alex Aldren, whose mellow, but thrusting tenor is very much the stuff of romantic leads.His father, Giorgio, is here a campaigning politician – the second verse of his aria becomes a public speech – hence his determination to protect his family’s reputation. Lawrence Wallington’s vocal line is not ideally rolling, but he is a live wire as a character that many productions reduce to a dull old stick.The energy of the supporting singers and chorus is matched by their acute responses, and the distinctive colours of Verdi’s score are captured by the 11-strong orchestra.In this intimate context conductor Sam Evans rightly and thrillingly takes some risks, emphasising the opera’s often feverish momentum.

First seen in 2010, her version of the 1882 comic opera in which the fairies take on the House of Lords – and win – is back for another tour.The framing device is neat and delicately handled: a group of schoolboys come across an old vocal score of Iolanthe in a dusty wardrobe in an empty theatre, and suddenly the show comes alive before us, with the eccentric Peers in hand-me-down costumes but the fairies more appealingly glammed up: and alive it definitely is in Mark Smith’s distinctive choreography, expertly delivered by an apparently tireless company.Sullivan’s vocal lines are no easy option, but they too are finely handled, with particularly stirring singing from Richard Russell Edwards’ grandiose Fairy Queen, Richard Carson’s debonair Strephon and Adam Pettit’s daffy Lord Tolloller, and with Duncan Sandilands’ manly bass well deployed as heartthrob guardsman Private Willis.Skilfully timed dialogue comes over with point. There’s pathos in all the right places, with Christopher Finn’s Iolanthe tugging at the heartstrings with He Loves. Alastair Hill has a patter triumph with the Lord Chancellor’s song. Choral activities are witty and precise.With its sparkle and sophistication, the top-drawer score is held together from the keyboard by Richard Baker, who manages to fulfil pretty well all orchestral requirements with a mere 10 fingers at his disposal.Edges will undoubtedly sharpen as the tour proceeds: but already there’s a sense of momentum that builds throughout the evening."

It certainly departs from the traditional mid-18th-century setting of Strauss’s romantic comedy, replacing it with the period of the work’s premiere (1911), including a silent appearance by Sigmund Freud listening to the Marschallin’s monologue as if she were one of his patients.Yet more important than these external trappings – their quirkiness part of their post-modern sensibility – is the sheer quality of the sentient, minutely observed staging, recreated for this revival by Sarah Fahie and brilliantly lit by Nigel Pashley. The ambivalent emotional core of the piece is repeatedly exposed, and even its profoundly affecting nostalgia, if you like, itself viewed nostalgically.The evening is also a testament to the strength of Glyndebourne’s casting, with all the major roles performed to a standard it would be hard to match and nigh-on impossible to beat: Rachel Willis-Sorensen’s astutely articulate lyricism gives her Marschallin a breadth of humanity perfectly balanced by Kate Lindsey’s gauche and impulsive Octavian. Elizabeth Sutphen’s shy yet eager Sophie is barely kept in line by Michael Kraus’ sharply realised, social-climbing father Faninal.Secondary roles are neatly dovetailed into the overall structure, and the wider ensemble – there are 44 individual artists named in the programme – sketched in with the finest of brushes.Even Rosenkavalier addicts might admit, however, that the piece can occasionally seem overlong, with stretches of the second and third acts tending to dip in quality.Not here, due to the comprehensive excellence of Brindley Sherratt’s Ochs – a tour-de-force of comic acting defined through masterly singing – and equally to conductor Robin Ticciati’s ability to highlight the infinitesimal detail of Strauss’s writing without sacrificing the broader picture.On evenings like this, the London Philharmonic reasserts its credentials as one of the world’s great opera orchestras.Madama Butterfly review at Glyndebourne, Lewes – ‘excellent performances’"

Act I takes place not in the hilltop house that Lieutenant Pinkerton has leased in Nagasaki, but in the offices of the marriage broker Goro, a consummate salesman who uses a cine film to teach young Japanese women about the American way. The filing cabinets compromise the sensuousness of the love duet, but they remind us that – for the groom, at least – the Pinkerton-Butterfly marriage is merely a transaction.Subsequently, the staging strives for few innovations, though its wholesale westernisation of Butterfly herself reduces the sense of culture clash. When she finally leaves the stage to prepare for suicide and re-enters in a simple white kimono, the effect is almost shocking.Olga Busuioc brings gravitas to Butterfly from the first moment – serious and thoughtful, never a fragile flower, and not quite heartbreaking. From Moldova, she has one of those voices that is richly grained throughout its range. As Pinkerton, Joshua Guerrero cannot match her for expansive tone, but he offers captivating Italianate style and verbal acuity.Elizabeth DeShong, sounding darkly sumptuous, is a Suzuki to be reckoned with and Michael Sumuel, glowing of voice, makes a generous and unusually assertive Sharpless. Carlo Bosi is both elegant and oleaginous as Goro.Omer Meir Wellber’s conducting favours lucidity and pace in Act I before achieving moments of almost Wagnerian solemnity as the situation becomes more desperate. The London Philharmonic sounds glorious.Der Rosenkavalier review at Glyndebourne, Lewes – ‘a superb revival’"

His chamber-scale piece to a libretto by Martin Crimp on the legend of the Pied Piper of Hamelin won an immediate success and was followed by Written on Skin, a much larger score again to a text by Crimp unveiled at the Aix-en-Provence Festival in 2012, and similarly widely taken up internationally.It is a mark of the keen expectation involved in this latest collaboration between playwright and composer – which takes as its subject the troubled reign and violent death of Edward II, and like the original production of Written on Skin is designed by Vicki Mortimer and directed by Katie Mitchell – that the piece has been co-commissioned and co-produced by no fewer than seven major opera companies in Europe and America: George Benjamin is arguably the UK’s most internationally celebrated opera composer since Benjamin Britten.Although Marlowe’s play was in Crimp’s mind when he began to create his operatic text, the result is an independent drama that Mortimer’s smart and fluent designs, based around an adaptable unit set, place visually in the here-and-now.While there’s no disguising that the central character is the English monarch forced to abdicate and then murdered in 1327, he is referred to only as the King (a finely detailed performance from Stephane Degout), while his son and successor Edward III is initially the Boy and later the Young King (sympathetically realised by Samuel Boden). Most of the other historical figures – Edward’s wife Isabel (sung with immaculate focus by Barbara Hannigan), his disloyal, authoritarian henchman Mortimer (convincingly repellent in Peter Hoare’s interpretation), and his lover Gaveston (a subtly ambivalent portrayal from Gyula Orendt), retain theirs. Meanwhile, in a silent, unnamed part as Edward’s daughter – referred to as Young Girl – Ocean Barrington-Cook retains a watchful and increasingly compelling presence.The focus of Crimp’s resonant libretto is the collision between love and power, articulated in Mortimer’s anger at Edward’s relationship with Gaveston, which causes him to set in motion the king’s removal; in Katie Mitchell’s disciplined staging not only do we see Edward and Gaveston destroyed, but also how Edward’s children in turn learn lessons in violence.Crimp knows how to leave room for music to amplify his points – which Benjamin’s fascinating score does with boundless technical skill and unceasing eloquence. The composer conducts an outstanding performance."

The depth of their bond is explored in one passage in the second act, but the pervasive impression is of cynicism, even grotesquery.If the action evokes the inter-war avant-garde, Osborn’s music also pays tribute to the 20th century. Intricate, animated and predominantly atonal, it contains snatches of parlour song as the Mother waxes nostalgic, and jazz rhythms flash through its lucid textures.It experiments with the juxtaposition of amplified and unamplified voices, and at one unforgettable moment the cast-members line up and frantically slap out a rhythm on their cheeks.A more sombre, formal mood prevails in the opera’s somewhat overextended third section, an epilogue that turns both surreal and murderous.While they have little opportunity to create rounded characters, the singers are virtuosic and energetic. Praise is due to both them and Theo Merz for the comprehensibility of the (English) text. Frederic Wake-Walker, responsible for the well-drilled semi-staging, ensures that the high jinks remain ironic rather than self-gratifying.As Leon, countertenor James Hall offers both sweetness and strength, while mezzo-soprano Lore Lixenberg fills the Mother’s lines with pungent tone. With the five instrumentalists of CHROMA and pianist Yshani Perinpanayagam on stage, Jamie Man conducts a tight, bristling performance."

The production is set in an abandoned mansion to which an elderly, widowed Tatyana (Rosy Sanders) has come to exorcise the ghosts of her youth. There are hints of Onegin’s glamorous past in his arrival mounted on a horse, first seen through a scrim across the back wall with the peasants celebrating the harvest. The ballet sequence, choreographed by Ashley Page, that opens Act III, shows him as a failing lothario as he attempts to seduce a ballerina.Such embellishments reinforce the opera’s emotional depth. Natalia Romaniw is a magnificent, mellow-toned Tatyana to Samuel Dale Johnson’s strutting and forceful Onegin. Her letter scene is lushly sung and, without going overboard, accentuates the underlying eroticism of her words.Peter Auty brings back some of Pushkin’s irony to the poet Lensky, and his relationship to Onegin is well explored, from their first arrival to Lensky’s death in the duel scene. His intended, Tatyana’s sister Olga, is given a flighty touch by Sioned Gwen Davies who seems the perfect match for Onegin in the party scene leading up to the duel.The chorus are never seen on stage, but glimpsed behind the scrim. Clever lighting from Fabiana Piccioli changes them between cheering silhouettes and leering, ghostly faces. A strong and evocative production, with the orchestra of Scottish Opera in particularly fine form under conductor Stuart Stratford. "

Though he set them to music as a concert work, the composer himself thought that the piece might work on stage. Jack Furness, artistic director of Shadwell Opera, is the latest to present it in theatrical form.The story tells of a rural farmer’s lad who meets and falls for Zefka, a Roma woman, and eventually runs away with her after she bears him a son. The appeal for the composer was that in 1917 he had met and fallen for a married Jewish woman four decades younger than himself, though she remained largely indifferent to the series of masterpieces she inspired.Furness’ simple, low-budget staging presents the tale in a contemporary context, where the man is a housing official dealing with homeless people and Zefka his client.Jack’s brother Sam Furness – both of them rising stars of British opera – fields a thrilling tenor in his vivid account of the vanishing man who keeps a video diary; he’s impressively partnered by Angharad Lyddon as Zefka, while the three mysterious offstage voices are delicately provided by Isabelle Haile, Beth Graham and Sapphire Armitage, with Thomas Ang attacking Janacek’s virtuosic, quasi-orchestral piano part with relish.The same forces are involved in the evening’s first work – the stage premiere of a new opera by Edward Nesbit that emulates Janacek’s scoring: the main difference is that the tenor here is the clear-toned Anthony Flaum – another fine stage performer with immaculate diction.He sings Theseus to Lyddon’s Antigone in The Grief of Antigone, drawn from the closing scene of Sophocles’ Oedipus at Colonus in another effective modern dress staging by Furness. Nesbit’s traditional score conveys plenty of atmosphere, while his vocal writing works a treat."

On its first revival the piece and its performance seem, if anything, even stronger than before.Venables is the first composer to set Kane’s work to music and his ability to find the right notes to match a text many of his colleagues would have deemed impossibly daunting feels unerring.Opera has always shown a capacity for encompassing emotional extremity. Mental illness is scarcely a new subject for the form, but never before has it been tackled with such insight and empathy as here. The bleakest despair, the numbness of self-hatred, even moments of the most painful humour, all find expression in Venables’ extraordinarily accomplished and imaginative writing.Using a combination of speech and song, plus a highly idiosyncratic way of setting words projected on a screen as a no-holds-barred battle between two percussionists – members of the brilliant contemporary music ensemble Chroma, who deliver the score in virtuoso fashion under conductor Richard Baker – Venables follows in the tradition of great composers who discover a way of making a fine text even more eloquent than it already is.Ted Huffman’s staging once again succeeds in visualising this intense process of internal psychological scrutiny, while an ensemble cast of six female singers play their individual parts with a sense of identification as harrowing as it is truthful.Invidious though it is to pick out individuals in this instance, the roles allotted to soprano Gweneth-Ann Rand and to mezzo Lucy Schaufer could not have fallen into more gifted hands; but their four colleagues do Kane and Venables proud, too.4.48 Psychosis review at Lyric Hammersmith – ‘startling and immensely moving’"

A co-production with Northern Sinfonia, its latest show Tell Me the Truth About Love is a joyous and passionate celebration of Tyneside past and present.Professional mezzo soprano Anna Huntley leads the non-professional ensemble cast, starring as perennial singleton Tina, who is a bridesmaid at her sister Gemma’s wedding. Her reluctant quest to find a man at the wedding forms the central narrative of Meriel Sheibani-Clare’s well-crafted story, which is interspersed with family arguments, fond childhood memories and revelations of secret affairs from the guests.This is not an opera in the traditional sense. The music of Britten and Tchaikovsky is joined by traditional folk tunes, 1980s power ballads and even Jimmy Nail. Yet this disparate source material is given cohesion by Timothy Burke’s assured musical direction.Although it is clear that Huntley is the only professional singer on Samal Blak’s pristine white petal-strewn stage, there are some nice performances from among the 30-strong ensemble. Martin Rivers, who plays wedding guest Malcolm, has a gentle soulful voice, while Louise Webster is highly entertaining as the larger-than-life bride. Special mention should also go to Bridgette Foley, who brings both a terrier-like fierceness and a vulnerability to the role of Tina’s estranged mother.Director Bijan Sheibani has done a fine job, instilling great discipline in his large ensemble while giving them the freedom to lose themselves to their own energy. This fine balancing act between tight choreography and unbridled exuberance is most evident in the rousing rendition of the Blaydon Races."

Before that, she seems too sympathetic to think of poisoning her odious father-in-law or prompting her lover to slice up her husband. Her singing is powerful and often rich-toned, but her Russian is murky.Better capturing the opera’s febrile pulse is tenor Brandon Jovanovich as the priapic Sergey. He commands the stage and produces a heroically shining tone.John Tomlinson sang Boris in Jones’ original production, and returns to the role. This opening night marked Tomlinson’s 40th anniversary with the Royal Opera. Happily, he remains a force of nature.John Daszak gives vocal muscle to the impotent Zinovy, while Peter Bronder makes a vivid Shabby Peasant and Wojtek Gierlach a sonorous Priest. Mikhail Svetlov is the sleazy Police Inspector to the life and Aigul Akhmetshina’s Sonyetka palpitates bitchily.After a first act that does not quite grab one by the throat, Antonio Pappano’s visceral conducting has a sense for the score’s beauties, and the 14-strong stage brass band covers itself in particular glory."

Wood chip on the floor and the smell of smoke give the immersive seating – benches round a traverse performing area – an extra hint of woodland for Henry McPherson’s Maud. It is a cautionary fairytale in which Maud (the clear and strongly voiced Evan Spence) finds a tiny baby that turns out to be a fearsome dragon.McPherson hints at greater depths to his libretto that could easily make a longer work. The Connect Chorus deliver his somewhat abrasive score with real clarity and strong atmosphere, while immediately proving their acting chops under Olivia Fuchs’s direction, transforming from fairy beings to frightened villagers and the ravenous beast itself.Fear is the theme of Little Black Lies, Helen Gron’s story of Sophie, alone and forgotten in a city awash with war. Simon Wilkinson’s lighting transforms the space into her hiding place. Hazel McBain has a stellar tone in her highest register as Sophie and, although lacking clarity, she conveys a real sense of paranoia, questioning the reality of what Sophie believes.There is a stronger melodic theme to Lewis Murphy’s Then to the Elements, Laura Attridge’s story of Anna who creates a child in her computer. With Christensen returning as Anna, Murphy has the Connect Chorus deliver an unsettlingly eerie version of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, in a cleverly twisting production.Opera Sparks shows a bright and inventive future for opera – but also shows the verve and finesse of the younger creatives it already has at its disposal. "

This potentially complex mixing of forms is explained in Helen Cooper’s splendidly demotic English translation of the prologue, though the Composer’s last minute revisions and the opera itself remains in German.In what was originally a trouser role, Julia Sporsen’s performance as the Composer as female is the key to McDonald’s production. Her argument with the burlesque star Zerbinetta about fidelity and Ariadne’s sorrow at being spurned by Theseus is now told from a female perspective and is all the more powerful for it.The burlesque elements are hugely successful. Jennifer France’s coloratura aria as Zerbinetta in the opera is near perfect in itself, but it is elevated by the not-quite striptease costume change she performs while she is singing it. Circus skills director Joe Dieffenbacher has done his job well, with Alex Otterburn given some particularly eye-catching tricks as Harlequin.The emphasis on burlesque slightly overshadows the opera seria element. Mardi Byers, as Ariadne, and Kor-Jan Dusseljee, as Bacchus, bring great beauty to their opera roles. Their presence might somewhat undermine the gravitas, but at the same time they underline the Composer’s passionately sung assertion that the music is the true art."

The soloists are brave and brilliant, running the gamut of emotions from frivolity to cold fury. But while each scene starts powerfully, it needs a brisk edit to make an impact.As Ottavia, Marta Fontanals Simmons sweeps on in an exquisite champagne-coloured pleated robe to declare: “Power. Of course I love power”.The bubbly Susanna, Raphaela Papadakis, fights her way out of a giant crinoline, while dramatic soprano Philippa Boyle, in a puffball dress of bloodied bandages, steals the show as the defiant teenager Salomé. Bess of Porgy and Bess and Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk are squashed into a duet that gives no chance for Gweneth Ann Jeffers or Catrin Woodruff to shine. Cellist Alice Purton fills the interludes with percussive solos that seemed to belong to a different concert.The spectacular costumes, like artworks, provide the only drama on a bare, starkly lit stage. In a last, noisy dinner-table tableau, the characters hammer home the message that there are countless women whose voices are never heard – a point made more subtly by their individual scenes."

While human emotion risks being eclipsed by the overused revolve and extraneous stage business, entertainment is all, even if it means that Mozart’s miraculous overture must play second fiddle to an extracurricular gag about a busy bee.The opera’s storyline, costumes and props are mostly in period but there’s a Hoover to rub in the timelessness of the exploitation plus shadowy video projections signifying threatening masculinity.The mostly young cast is capable. One of several principals taking up their roles for the first time, Lucy Crowe has graduated to the Countess and is vocally strong and dramatically affecting though not without some curiously tempered vowels.With a Don Giovanni for Opera Holland Park under his belt, the young British bass-baritone Ashley Riches shows great potential as a lofty and entitled Count. Rhian Lois’ resourceful Susanna grows in confidence and character from a generic soubrettish start. Katie Coventry makes another promising role debut as Cherubino. The weakest spots are the stolid, lumpish Figaro of Thomas Oliemans and an initially lazy contribution from the pit.Martyn Brabbins, conducting his first ENO revival as Music Director, takes time to recover from co-ordination problems that should be resolved later in the run.

The result is essentially a family opera, with plenty of children in the audience for its first performance.Coraline is the story of an 11-year-old girl who enters a mysterious next-door apartment through a theoretically bricked-up door to discover a sinister mirror image of her own family home occupied by another mother and another father – like her own but with black-button eyes.Finding herself in increasingly dangerous territory, she draws on her intelligence and bravery to make good her escape, taking with her as she does so both her now-imprisoned real parents while also freeing some ghostly children.The result possesses elements of a classic fairytale set within an ambience that combines the everyday with the dark and the grotesquely comic.It’s an appealing and potent mix, brilliantly presented here visually in Aletta Collins’ sharply drawn production within characterful sets by Giles Cadle that use a revolve to switch effortlessly between one flat and another, including those occupied by Coraline’s other neighbours – a couple of retired thesps (wittily supplied by Gillian Keith as Miss Spink and Frances McCafferty as Miss Forcible) and the elderly Lithuanian Mr Bobo (amiably personified by Harry Nicoll), with his orchestra of musical mice.At the centre are the portrayals of Coraline and her parents – in both their positive and negative forms. Mary Bevan doesn’t quite convince as the 11-year-old of the title-role, nor are her physical mannerisms particularly childlike, but she’s vocally at the top of her game and expertly matched by Kitty Whately and Alexander Robin Baker, who play both sets of parents – the decent and the damned.Turnage is one of the UK’s most admired composers, whose works include a genuine modern classic in the shape of his first opera, Greek (1988), based on Steven Berkoff’s East End Oedipus drama.His new score is admirable in its refusal to settle for eager-to-please options, but while there’s no sense of writing down to an audience of kids there are places where something more striking is needed. In two halves, the show feels on the long side, and some of the plot in the second act seems more trouble than it’s worth.Yet young Gaiman aficionados will love it for its broad fidelity to its source as well as its clever and at times magical staging.With the Britten Sinfonia in the pit, Sian Edwards conducts a clean and confident performance of a piece that has a good deal going for it, especially in a production as skilful as this one."

Director John Savournin’s pocket-sized production of The Mikado by Charles Court Opera is full of wit, impeccable timing and exceptional acting and singing by the energetic cast.Eschewing a cod-Japanese aesthetic, the director and designers set the action in a British Consulate, a gentlemen’s club where the officials sported toothbrush moustaches, strangulated Queen’s English and a catalogue of silly walks.Matthew Kellett as Pooh-Bah is especially nimble, leaping over sofas and balancing on chairs, outclassed in physical comedy only by Philip Lee as Ko-Ko. His acrobatic contortions occasionally tip into hysteria, but his Tit-Willow song is a tour de force.As a delightfully gauche Nanki-Poo, Jack Roberts sings in an old-fashioned, tremulous tenor to his teenage sweetheart Yum-Yum, the assured Welsh soprano Alys Roberts. She is flanked by Corinne Cowling as a cheeky Peep-Bo and the confident Pitti-sing of Jessica Temple.Consular officer Matthew Siveter reappears as a hulking Katisha; he’s somewhere between a pantomime dame and tragic diva. but he sings so well. As the Mikado, Matthew Palmer’s boyish face is unrecognisable under the whiskers and burgundy-red cheeks.Though the dated use of the Japanese setting has gone, the issue of child abuse remains – those schoolgirls are definitely under age – and the Mikado’s relish for graphic executions is troubling.These things aside, this is a triumphant achievement both visually and musically, thanks to the fizzing energy that radiates from David Eaton at the piano. "

Her substantial, smoky instrument, with its darkly coloured lower register, suits the character and she remains unfazed by even the trickiest notes, even if her coloratura is on the efficient side of brilliant. In a revival where acting standards are not significantly better than adequate, she passes muster.Royal Opera regular Zeljko Lucic is solid and reliable as her husband. As before in this production, he’s allowed to sing the solo finale Verdi wrote for the original staging in 1847 and then replaced 18 years later with a general hymn of victory. Here – rather pointlessly – we get both, so the opera effectively ends twice.Singing Macduff is Azerbaijani tenor Yusif Eyvazov – Netrebko’s husband since 2015, and seemingly part of the deal if you want her these days; but his individual timbre and general air of dynamism genuinely cut the mustard and he can be counted among the show’s stronger elements; likewise Ildebrando D’Arcangelo’s noble Banquo.But with its general ugliness and clumsy stagecraft – Banquo’s assassination and posthumous reappearance at the Macbeths’ subsequent festivities are both woefully ineffective – Lloyd’s production is weak and unfocused.Drawing the musical threads together, at least, is conductor Antonio Pappano, who with his keen understanding of tempo and colour once again demonstrates his mettle as a Verdi conductor. The choral and orchestral force respond to him with alacrity. His shaping of the chorus of Scottish exiles is a highpoint."

But this is a show well worth seeing – and a company well worth supporting."

Having risked public ire in setting Pushkin’s revered text, Tchaikovsky rejected grand theatricality for simple, sincere expression: “To hell with scenic effects,” he wrote; “what I need is human beings, not puppets … beings similar to myself who have experienced sensations which I, too, have experienced.”In this chamber production for Mid Wales Opera, director-designer Richard Studer certainly keeps things simple – and the stripped-bare, period staging has a basic charm. But he takes his own risks with a light-touch directorial approach that relies too heavily on individual singers to convey (in English translation) not only complex characters which develop over time, but the clash of rustic and metropolitan cultures.As a result, the drama lacks depth and focus – and music director Jonathan Lyness’ score reduction proves double-edged: on the one hand, using just 12 musicians (a very willing Ensemble Cymru) emphasises domestic intimacy but, on the other, it leaves Tchaikovsky’s expansive romantic lyricism feeling short-changed – especially where singers fail to supply colouristic warmth.Oddly, the dynamic balance is largely in the musicians’ favour, with George von Bergen’s mannequin Onegin sounding remote in more ways than one. His Tatyana, Elizabeth Karani, has more clarity and drive, gamely supported by Maria Jagusz’ Filipyevna and, in particular, Ailsa Mainwaring as a ringlet-shaking Olga.Smaller roles are spirited – notably Nicholas Moreton’s Zaretsky and Sion Goronwy’s Gremin – and the reduced chorus is nonetheless robust. But the vocal and dramatic highlight is Robyn Lyn Evans’ Lensky. Sensitive yet quick to judge, he captures the sense of a poet torn between private emotional turmoil and rigid social convention. "

Kramer and his design team understand that the milieu in which courtesan Violetta exists is a louche one, and the manic crew that turn up in their wildly over-the-top fancy-dress costumes for her party in Act I, as well as for Flora’s in Act II, are ostentatiously presented, pleasure-seeking hedonists: Flora’s event quickly descends into an orgy.But Kramer’s vision fails to suggest the emotional niceties and nuances observed even within such a blatantly superficial society: what ought to be complex and subtle becomes overstated and camp.Money has been spent on Lizzie Clachan’s glittery sets for the party scenes (Busby Berkeley seems to be the visual reference point), even though the plainness of the countryside idyll in Act II – where Violetta and her naive young lover Alfredo have hidden themselves away from the crazy delights of the Parisian demimonde –look bizarrely stark.When the curtain goes up on Act III, Violetta – traditionally visualised as dying from tuberculosis in her own bedroom – is quite literally digging her own grave. It’s a shock. Is this meant to imply that her death is all her own fault?There are problems, too, with the central casting. Claudia Boyle is a physically graceful Violetta, but her delicate soprano is too small for this role in a house of this size and she regularly sings under the note.Making his UK debut as Alfredo, South African tenor Lukhanyo Moyake brings good vocal material and possesses clear potential, but his singing lacks finesse and as yet he’s an awkward stage performer.Providing something close to a model of Verdi singing, however, is Alan Opie, in his 50th year with the company, as Alfredo’s father, Giorgio Germont. Binding notes and words together, he alone maintains the vocal standards in a principal role ENO needs to achieve; his performance is duly received with an ovation.Smaller roles are all decently done, and everyone involved makes a conspicuous effort to deliver the directorial concept, however ill-judged it may be.Keeping the score on track is conductor Leo McFall – another company debutant, who conveys a sense of style; but it’s not nearly enough to redeem a crudely conceived, woefully misguided production."

As the audience enters, each person is given a veil and asked to put it on – though in practice many soon remove them.The immersive staging takes place on four trailer platforms where small groups of actors play out intense but generalised individual scenes involving aggression (often instigated by the police), compassion, and more detailed narratives, one featuring a small church congregation from which a gay man is excluded.The audience is steered around the warehouse by other actors, some of them forming instrumentally accompanied choral groups. To one side a much larger ensemble is conducted with keen determination by Jonathon Heyward.The central story of Christ raising Lazarus is delivered with appropriate scale and commitment by four professional singers, each vocally and dramatically impressive; Joshua Stewart’s troubled Lazarus is well matched by Elliott Carlton Hines’ inspiring Jesus, Nardus Williams’ impassioned Martha by Mimi Doulton’s precise Mary. But their task is made considerably harder by an acoustic that eats up the words, not enough of which register with sufficient clarity.In terms of overall impact some scenes work better than others; yet despite impressive moments there’s a broad sense of a piece that needs a clearer structure. Battistelli’s score, too, is an uneven achievement, regularly strong on atmosphere but elsewhere registering as little more than background."

Janacek expert John Tyrrell’s new edition brings us closer to the composer’s intentions than ever before. The large, nearly all-male cast provides exemplary individual assumptions and the Royal Opera House Orchestra is on its most dedicated form under the insightful baton of Mark Wigglesworth.The production – the first work by the admired Polish director Krzysztof Warlikowski to be seen in the UK – has outstanding virtues, particularly in its presentation of the everyday life of the prison, moved forward in Malgorzata Szczesniak’s designs from Siberia around 1860 to a contemporary but geographically non-specific context.Nothing is shirked in visualising the everyday brutality of the institution of the prison itself — with the inmates visiting sexual and other forms of violence on each other, just as those in overall charge do on them.The central narratives of the featured prisoners recounting their horrendous crimes – the darkly tragic yet deeply human heart of the piece – are unfolded with concentrated power by Stefan Margita’s Luka, Ladislav Elgr’s Skuratov and Johan Reuter’s Siskov. Nicky Spence doubles memorably and at times outrageously as Nikita/Big Prisoner.Willard W White frames the piece with his dignified Gorjancikov. Allison Cook brings pathos as well as pizzazz to the unnamed sex-worker. Pascal Charbonneau reveals the humanity of Aljeja, here a trans prisoner. Innumerable secondary roles in this quintessentially ensemble piece are brilliantly defined.Less admirable – and indeed redundant – are the additional filmed sequences involving philosopher Michel Foucault and others taken from the documentary Gangster Backstage, which tell the audience nothing the show itself doesn’t already make painfully clear."

An archaising, harpsichord-style keyboard tinkles prominently in Dark Lady.The Bible’s sober locutions and Shaw’s wordy mock-Tudorisms sometimes make things heavy-going for the singers (and occasionally for the audience too), but there are involving, large-scale performances from Alison Buchanan as Ruth and Byron Jackson as Boaz, while Kamilla Dunstan makes an eloquent, dignified, if youthful, Naomi and Damien Noyce a dynamic Amnon.In The Dark Lady, Sarah Champion rules the roost as Elizabeth, though Oliver Brignal makes a glowingly intense case for Shakespeare. Annabelle Williams is a peachy-toned Dark Lady and Peter Brathwaite a resolute, alert Warder.Director Eduardo Barreto, an opera debutant, rightly maintains stylised, sometimes touching simplicity in Ruth, and he supercharges the final peroration by placing singers around the audience, standing on pews.Dark Lady, meanwhile, goes more for sly humour than rampant tongue-in-cheek stuff."

Young Giorgetta is sick of her dreary life with her controlling older husband Michele, and longs to escape with her lover, Luigi. A planned late-night assignation ends with Michele killing both lovers.It’s a bleak tale, but dramatically, this production doesn’t completely cohere. Musically, there are affecting vocal moments from Craig Smith as the spurned Michele and Sarah-Jane Lewis as Giorgetta, and the pleasure of Il Tabarro’s lush score, with its many allusions to La Boheme.The naturalism of Il Tabarro gives way to the broad comedy of Gianni Schicchi. We find ourselves in overstuffed bedroom – imaginatively realised by Irish – filled with the greedy relatives of the late but not especially lamented Buoso Donati. The discovery that Buoso has left his entire fortune to the monks of Signa thwarts the Donati family’s dreams of wealth and Rinuccio’s plans to marry Lauretta, Gianni Schicchi’s daughter.Enter Schicchi himself, who devises a cunning plan to give the Donatis what they need – but not necessarily what they want. The character of Gianni Schicchi was plucked from Dante’s Inferno, where he’d been consigned to hell for stealing a family fortune. Puccini and the ETO’s charismatic Schicchi (Andrew Slater) persuade us that Schicchi was hard done by.Schicchi is an ensemble opera, and the smile-inducing costumes and the cast’s high energy are infectious. There are fine solo turns from Galina Averina as Lauretta, bringing a beguiling tenderness to the famous O mio babbino caro, and from Clarissa Meek, whose expert comic timing makes the most of the grasping Zita – she excels as well as Frugola the ragpicker in Il Tabarro. The Marriage of Figaro review at Hackney Empire, London – ‘perfectly cast’"

The only departure from the book is the notion of a contemporary cast getting into period costume during the overture.With Neil Irish’s handsome unit set skilfully conveying the interior and garden exterior of the 18th-century palace where the action takes place, McIntyre conveys all the numerous intricate developments in the complex intrigue that comprises the plot; she is successful, too, in helping a uniformly strong cast to realise their characters. BAME artists feature prominently. Jeremy Sams’ translation hits the spot.Vital, alert and quite properly at the centre of things is Ross Ramgobin’s Figaro – another successful step forward in the career of this appreciably talented young baritone. Similarly seizing her dramatic opportunities while flaunting a lyric soprano of major quality is Nadine Benjamin as the Countess.The warmth and precision of Rachel Redmond’s lighter voice draw attention to her sharp but human Susanna. With his manner suggesting the kind of entitlement that has recently become so notorious amongst various powerful male figures, Dawid Kimberg delivers the Count with nonchalant ease.Perfectly capturing the boyish awkwardness of Cherubino is Katherine Aitken, whose refined mezzo-soprano proves an ideal match for Mozart’s music.Secondary roles are nicely sketched in, with Gaynor Keeble a grand-scale Marcellina, Omar Ebrahim a redoubtable Bartolo, John-Colyn Gyeantey a knowing Basilio and Devon Harrison’s interventions as Antonio uproarious.Conductor Christopher Stark maintains expertly chosen tempos while ETO’s orchestra is on top form, though the kind of vocal decoration Mozart would have expected is missing.Presumably for economic reasons the show cuts the chorus, which is a bearable loss; but it’s a shame to jettison Figaro’s textually important last-act aria, especially with Ramgobin around to deliver it.Tosca review at Hackney Empire, London – ‘a spirited production’"

Outstanding in quality are Soraya Mafi’s entrancing Tytania, Joshua Bloom’s grandiose Bottom, and the entire team of mechanicals, with Graeme Danby a stalwart Quince but the whole team maximising the comic potential of their scenes.Christopher Ainslie brings an ethereal beauty of tone to Oberon, his otherworldliness perfectly complemented by the down-to-earthiness of the mature but hyper-athletic Puck of Miltos Yerolemou, who weighs every word in the balance. The Trinity Boys Choir embody a first-rate fairy troupe.Throughout one notices the general improvement in the company’s verbal communication skills since it started to employ diction coaches – here the savvy Richard Suart.Iolanthe review at London Coliseum – ‘crude and misguided’"

For its second production the enterprising company the Opera Story has come up with Goldilocks and the Three Little Pigs, colliding and reinventing two favourite children’s tales.Thankfully the plot is less cut and dried than in a typical MCU offering. True, Goldilocks wanders through an idyllic wood at the opening, birds a-singing, but there the fairy tale ends. Goldilocks has been orphaned and left to fend for herself.Despite the awakening of nature – richly captured in Vahan Salorian’s colourful, multilayered score – she has to find food. This is where the three little pigs (actually, bear-pigs, sporting bear-claw slippers and pig ears) come in, a family themselves living in fear of forest beasts higher up the food chain.A savage undertone brings the tales viscerally to life, while the throbbing red carcass brought home by Daddy Bear-Pig for the family table, and a subsequent bestial killing, answers the white space of the Copeland Gallery, which practically screams for blood to be spilled.Salorian’s score 10-piece ensemble often takes on an orchestral scope and ably reflects both the naïve and the base elements of the action.Australian baritone Nicholas Lester gives the standout performance vocally – and manages to be both suave (as far as standing in bear-claw slippers allows) and chilling in his encounter with Goldilocks. Carolyn Dobbin is warm-voiced as Mother Bear-Pig and counter-tenor Daniel Keating-Roberts grows into his role as Baby Bear-Pig, for all his innocence realising by the end that it’s a dog eat dog world."

Caird’s programme-note allusion to “recent press stories about sexual harassment in high places” hardly denotes an eager grasp of the rape and grooming issues that, together with kidnap and murder, Mozart himself seizes in what ought to be a sparkling critique of moral ambivalence and power abuse in the name of liberty.Of course, Don Giovanni gets his comeuppance here (Gavan Ring in a promising role debut). But any questioning of gender or class injustice – whether serious or witty – goes skin deep. Indeed, Donna Elvira (Elizabeth Watts) is roundly humiliated, while Donna Anna’s trauma (Emily Birsan) and Zerlina’s near miss (Katie Bray) are deflated by Don Ottavio’s cowardly egotism (Benjamin Hulett) and Massetto’s wounded masculinity (Gareth Brynmor John).It falls to David Stout to provide depth and cynical wit as a conflicted, would-be lothario Leporello. Together with powerful Commendatore, Miklos Sebestyén, he and the entire, committed cast and revival director Caroline Chaney deserve credit for bringing life, at least, to John Napier’s dourly inert, Rodin-inspired staging.With some supple singing and deft ensemble interplay throughout, they are helped by conductor James Southall’s airy punchiness, and fine playing from the WNO Orchestra. "

In fact librettist Terrence McNally does a good job in creating a trajectory that leads us from the horrific rape and double murder committed by fictional criminal Joseph De Rocher to his eventual execution.His character and Prejean’s inevitably steal the limelight and the bulk of the piece – though some time is given over to the parents of the victims, who are understandably not that keen to forgive him (or her). As a piece of theatre intended to advocate the abolition of the death penalty, the result is undeniably effective.But to what extent the score provides a commensurate musical experience is debatable. Heggie writes fluently and with skill, but with little originality in what is essentially an apt, filmic accompaniment to the action.This semi-staging benefits from most of the cast and the conductor having recently taken part in a full-scale production in Madrid. As ever the committed artist, Joyce DiDonato knows how to maximise the potential of her role as Sister Helen, while Michael Mayes shirks none of the unpleasantness of Joseph De Rocher.The secondary roles are all perfectly sketched in, while working with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, BBC Singers and Finchley Children’s Music Group, conductor Mark Wigglesworth ensures a tight, expertly driven performance."

On the minus side, the piece could do with a stronger score, and certainly one less stylistically reliant on other composers, notably John Adams; Dove’s own musical identity tends to disappear for long, musically anonymous stretches. The drama, too, feels over extended, particularly in the last two of the three acts.But Stephen Barlow’s production, brilliantly designed by Andrew Riley and with lighting by Richard Howell – their electrical storm in Act II is an absolute visual triumph – is unfailingly clever and manages to paper over some inherent cracks, while all the principal roles are skilfully done and fit perfectly into a strong ensemble.Rising countertenor star James Laing makes consistently beautiful sounds as he conveys the quiet despair of the central character, with soprano Jennifer France hitting the vocal heights as the stratospherically inclined Controller.Scottish Opera’s music director Stuart Stratford conducts a consistently secure, regularly dynamic performance."

The absurdly pitted crusty-peers-versus-capricious-fairies war supplies compelling drama, and the parliamentary satire has lost none of its edge since 1882.Depressingly, director Cal McCrystal has little faith in any of this. Whereas Jonathan Miller’s Mikado, still going strong after 30 years, brings a fresh approach while respecting the original, McCrystal tramples insensitively over Gilbert and Sullivan’s work with crude, unfunny new material and desperate deployment of a pantomime cow.Blunt references to the “exposed manhood” of half-fairy Strephon (Marcus Farnsworth) make explicit what is far funnier in Gilbert’s subtle innuendo, shouty interjections from bit-part fairy Fleta interrupt the flow and unnecessarily prolong the evening, a tender love duet is destroyed by incongruous focus-pulling antics involving stage-hands, and the fairies’ laboured delivery and stilted gestures feel painfully like a send-up.The production’s virtues shine more brightly in Act II, encumbered by fewer extraneous additions: Paul Brown’s splendid Victorian sets and costumes and an excellent cast led by Andrew Shore’s robust Lord Chancellor and Yvonne Howard’s redoubtable Fairy Queen, with Ben Johnson and Ben McAteer a spot-on aristocratic double-act as Tolloller and Mountararat. There are some brilliant comic touches too. The joyous If You Go In, You’re Sure to Win, fizzes with priceless slapstick.Stripped of McCrystal’s misguided additions (the biggest laughs still come from Gilbert), English National Opera could yet salvage a production worthy of the piece.Iolanthe director Cal McCrystal: ‘Big laughs come when people  fall over, not from clever lines’  "

There’s too much ambling and some pointless running. The show has gone limp.There are some worthwhile musical foundations. Claire Rutter’s soprano offers all the notes and the edge to her tone is not inappropriate in the emotionally stressed-out context of the title-role. Mexican Hector Sandoval is a useful tenor to have around but he possesses little vocal or dramatic charisma as romantic hero Cavaradossi, while his arms have a life of their own.Mark S Doss’s Scarpia achieves more by means of a dark solid core to his tone and a manner that combines some of the suavity and sadism required for this iconic operatic villain. The secondary roles are all decently done but again there are fuzzy edges.WNO’s chorus has a good evening, while under the experienced Carlo Rizzi the company’s orchestra is technically secure and its tone shines brightly; but it’s not enough to redeem the overall flabbiness on stage."

Epic in scale, it purveys a narrative in which an accidental death inaugurates a complex sequence of events through which fate pursues the three central characters to their doom.Yet interspersed with these high-flown scenes are others showing the beleaguered lives of the populace in peace and war – often set in a manner resembling comic opera. The result frequently falls apart.Yet Pountney and his design team show how it can be held together, with the two components uniting to reinforce Verdi’s dark message of the random tragedy of human existence and the inability of the church to heal the wounds of those who suffer. Here the whole enterprise has an admirable tautness from first to last.Presiding over the lengthy evening is the figure of fate herself, personified by Justina Gringyte, who doubles as the warmongering Roma girl Preziosilla and Curra, the maid who tries to hasten Donna Leonora in the disastrously delayed elopement of the opening scene.As the opera’s hard-pressed heroine, Mary Elizabeth Williams brings flexibility and imagination to her vocal performance, with Gwyn Hughes Jones matching her note-for-note as her racially abused lover Don Alvaro; less vocally magnetic – though equally dramatically focused – is Luis Cansino as her brother Don Carlo.Doubling as Leonora’s father and the Father Superior, Miklos Sebestyen is powerfully effective, while Donald Maxwell makes something grimly comic out of mean-spirited monk Melitone.The WNO chorus and orchestra are on peak form under Carlo Rizzi, who offers a thrilling account of the score. "

Kosky has reduced the piece to a series of deracinated tableaux linked by miked-up offstage narration.The Spanish archetypes are still present in the music of course, however unpredictably rejigged from the latest concatenation of available editions.  Kosky gives us a hyperactive blend of German Regietheater and updated commedia dell’arte; Carmen retains an androgynous look until the final scene imprisons her in a florid gown.Making her first Covent Garden appearance, Anna Goryachova is suitably smoky in the lead. Sadly her voice sometimes centres just under the note, as if weighed down by the welter of stage business which leaves Kristina Mkhitaryan, in another house debut, relatively unscathed. Her Micaela has the subtlety lacking elsewhere and is almost touching.Francesco Meli is a respectable Don Jose, Kostas Smoriginas merely passable as Escamillo. The conducting is charmlessly efficient and the revue ends, quite literally, with a shrug.If that sounds negative, the incidentals, from the interpolated dance element to the finer points of make-up, are brilliantly achieved. The single staircase set, often crammed with extras subverting as much as supporting the action, is lit with exhausting, daringly monochromatic radiance by Joachim Klein.Carmen director Barrie Kosky: ‘I love operetta – It’s more like Dada than pantomime’"

As demonstrated here, ENO must certainly be counted one of the most expert companies anywhere in terms of performing his scores to the highest standards.Set in South Africa between 1896 and 1913, Satyagraha (‘truth-force’) draws on ancient Sanskrit religious texts and is sung in that language: more surtitles would be useful.Nevertheless, aided by brilliant video designs courtesy of 59 Productions, and a variety of other skills associated with the creative collective Improbable – including puppetry, aerialism and acrobatics – McDermott’s inventive staging comes up with an unstoppable flow of striking visual images.Together with Improbable’s skills ensemble, ENO’s fully engaged principals and chorus succeed in creating a staging of virtuoso physicality allied to musical sensitivity and intellectual clarity: rarely are all the elements of an opera brought together so flawlessly as they are here.At the heart of the show is Toby Spence’s thoughtful, cleanly sung Gandhi — human, touching and infinitely dignified as his ideas develop into actions that will change the course of history.The secondary roles, too – reflecting Gandhi’s co-workers and supporters, often in conflict with the wider South African community portrayed by the chorus – are impeccably done.A Glass specialist, conductor Karen Kamensek combines precision with steadiness and flexibility in supervising a musical performance that is both contemplative and stimulating, and at its best transcendent."

There is clear child abuse here. Cio-Cio-San (Madama Butterfly) is just 15 when she finds herself swept into a marriage with an American lieutenant and abandoned with false promises that he will return.The romantic swell of the music, though as rousing and heart-stopping as ever, comes keenly loaded with other meanings now. Tim Albery’s production for Opera North premiered in 2007, long before this became a national conversation, but its formal sense of solemnity and stillness works well to amplify those concerns.Puccini’s Orientalist opera is given a specifically Japanese flavour in Hildegard Bechtler’s geometric design of slanted ramps, sliding panels and mountain vistas, as well as Ana Jebens’ gorgeous kimono costumes.The production has a static severity, not least in the long instrumental passage in which Butterfly awaits the return of Pinkerton as the superb Opera North orchestra under Martin Pickard’s baton comes to the dramatic fore. Albery boldly allows the stage picture to be held with very little movement, as an offstage reprise of One Fine Day is heard.Earlier, however, it sometimes threatens to drown some of the singers, with Merunas Vitulski’s vocally underpowered but physically solid Pinkerton a particular victim. But Anne Sophie Duprels’ Madama Butterfly is a shimmering glory, her voice soaring and dramatically heartbreaking.Sung in the original Italian, there is also notable support from Ann Taylor as Butterfly’s servant Suzuki and Peter Savidge as the American consul, who acts as messenger between Butterfly and Pinkerton. "

The first performance of this revival of Jonathan Kent’s Tosca, first seen in 2006, was dedicated to the memory of Paul Brown, whose designs graced seven Royal Opera productions in all, and much else besides.Twelve years on it remains an entirely viable show, with the cast and conductor rising confidently to many of the vocal and dramatic challenges set by Puccini and his librettists in this perennially popular thriller.With her lavish, clean-edged soprano well deployed in the title-role, Adrianne Pieczonka achieves distinction in the vocal side of her performance, though she could do with more dramatic individuality.Baritone Gerald Finley, her fellow Canadian, is one of those artists whose intelligence and savoir-faire help him convince in just about any role he attempts; here he presents the psychological menace of the suave, sinister Scarpia, even if one feels that this is not an ideal vocal match.Assuredly bringing a true and highly distinctive Latinate quality to his vocalism, Maltese tenor Joseph Calleja sings Cavaradossi with a combination of passion and refinement. His acting is more than adequate, even if there’s little sense of sexual magnetism between him and Pieczonka’s Tosca.Secondary roles are well up to the Royal Opera’s regular standards. With his resonant bass and keen diction, Simon Shibambu, a member of the Jette Parker Young Artists Programme, commands attention as Angelotti. Jeremy White is the skilful Sacristan, while Aled Hall makes a memorable creation out of Scarpia’s fearful henchman, Spoletta. Jai Sai Mehta sings the Shepherd Boy with considerable expertise.Once again the chorus and orchestra distinguish themselves, and though Dan Ettinger’s conducting has a few mannerisms he generally manages to maintain a commendable degree of tension."

Back in Venice in 1640 Monteverdi’s commercial producers could not afford a chorus, but here the piece has been harmlessly adapted to include one in a way that is integral rather than extraneous: led by postgraduates from the Guildhall School of Music, 40 singers from the local Roundhouse community and the Royal Opera’s outpost in Thurrock make their presence felt as migrants displaced by the Trojan War.It adds a further dimension to a show in which all the principal parts, large and small, are expertly taken, and which survives the potentially disastrous vocal indisposition on the first night of Christine Rice, whose Penelope is one of the opera’s two central roles: Rice nevertheless acts her role irreproachably from a physical point of view while Caitlin Hulcup sings it from the pit in a brilliant piece of practical and artistic dovetailing.Roderick Williams leads the show as careworn Ulysses, who summons up the strength to deal with the scurrilous suitors and Stuart Jackson’s comic-grotesque parasite Irus. Samuel Boden’s troubled Telemachus, Susan Bickley’s solid Eurycleia, Francesca Chiejina’s vibrant Melantho and Mark Milhofer’s canny Eumaeus all distinguish themselves.Performed in the round, the production takes place on a revolving circular platform with the orchestra of the Early Opera Company in the middle. Baroque specialist Christian Curnyn superintends the music, keeping things stylish and moving steadily forwards."

The notorious Dance of the Seven Veils, though, is something of a non-event.Nor is this a vintage cast – at least from a vocal point of view. Malin Bystrom makes a physically credible Salome, if not quite a fascinating one, but her voice refuses to take off in her upper register, where Strauss’ long phrases need it to gleam and bloom.Michael Volle’s Jokanaan (aka John the Baptist) is a solid, wooden figure with a solid, wooden voice, yet the steely core needed to cut through like a man of God on a mission is not his to command.John Daszak makes a presentable Herod, but is outshone by Michaela Schuster’s louche Herodias – the only one of the principals really to seize her opportunities.Rising star tenor David Butt Philip makes surprisingly little impression on this occasion as Narraboth; even the character’s suicide – a crucial moment in the steady downwards trajectory of the piece – goes for little, while Christina Bock is an anonymous Page.Part of the reason the pudding fails to rise lies is the conducting of Henrik Nanasi, which delivers in terms of balance in a score where it is all too easy to overload the textures, yet lacks the sense of driving inexorably towards the terrible goal that the piece requires. Despite the high level of focus in the orchestral playing itself, for once this is an evening where what one sees exceeds what one hears."

He will be hugely missed.At 16 years old, the production itself is clearly a stayer, though it is not easy to see why. Michael Vale’s ugly sets offer no sense of place or period but are somewhat redeemed by Tanya McCallin’s Renaissance costumes.Elsewhere, the show’s sexual shenanigans are over the top and simultaneously unconvincing – a particularly unfortunate combination – while some of the central cast cannot summon up sufficient dramatic detail in their roles to make Verdi’s tragic melodrama involving. The narrative never grips as it should.As the accursed jester, Dimitri Platanias’ mighty baritone is impressive but his broad-brush-stroke approach short-changes the complexity of his character. Sofia Fomina has the notes for Gilda but generates little sympathy.Michael Fabiano swaggers gamely as the Duke and his supercharged tenor radiates confident entitlement. He makes a highlight of his Act II aria.Amongst secondary roles Andrea Mastroni’s full-toned bass helps him score highly as a suavely sinister Sparafucile, while Bulgarian mezzo debutante Nadia Krasteva almost equals his impact as his sister Maddalena. James Rutherford is a disappointingly woolly Monterone.Conducting this time around is Alexander Joel, British-born but as yet better known on the continent. He does an effective job, but the precision and momentum that might help galvanise the show are not really evident."

Founded in 1971, it offers the invaluable opportunity for 80 schoolchildren aged nine-18 to participate in a brand new opera, created and produced by professionals.This year’s swashbuckling project is based on the historical tale of Lady Mary Killigrew, a bored housewife who decided to become a pirate. Caught and sentenced to hang, she was reprieved with a pardon from Elizabeth I – who, Donald Sturrock’s lively and witty libretto plausibly suggests, sympathised with another strong female and wanted to reward her pluck.With plenty of action, a fun sense of subversiveness, and triumph against the odds (the women-know-your-place male establishment), the story is a gift for the young cast, who throw themselves into it with passion, commitment and tangible joy.Stuart Hancock’s score, cleverly tailored for mixed abilities, is an appealing blend of opera, musical, film soundtrack, hummable melodies and operatic sophistication. It is a feat for director Susan Moore just to fit the colossal cast onto the small stage at Hammersmith’s Polish Centre, yet everyone is fully involved and the action inventive and full of energy. The small professional band is superb (though, sadly, off-stage) and conductor Philip Sunderland keeps the music zipping along, deftly holding things together during the occasional wobble.The joy is infectious – it is impossible not to feel elated at the incredible achievement of these young people, from 37 different West London schools, 25% on bursaries (including several from families affected by the Grenfell Tower disaster). The benefits for those involved are incalculable, and the result is polished family entertainment. We need more companies like W11 Opera."

But the most striking updating is the English adaptation by director Adam Spreadbury-Maher and Becca Marriott (who also sings the heroine Mimi). Liberally sprinkled with insults and expletives, it renders the scenario believable in itself, even if it occasionally grates in the context of the music. Mimi herself, rather than a consumptive, is a user. Needless to say, everyone is constantly on their phones.In this bijou performing space the experience is visceral, with plenty of movement into the audience – from an empowered Musetta (sung by Honey Rouhani) and from Mimi who, destitute by the second half, asks audience members for spare change or the whereabouts of her lover. The passion between her and Ralph (Rodolfo in Puccini’s original) is unusually believable without being overly self-conscious. Unfortunately, the space is too small to contain the sound of these keen operas singers.Roger Paterson is a metrosexual Ralph whose profound affection for (as well as attraction to) Mimi is keenly expressed. The Marcello character (here Mark) is sung by an ample-toned Thomas Isherwood, who brings wry humour to the buddy banter. Marriott sings Mimi with dramatic weight, even if she is excessively weak-kneed in her first encounter with Ralph. A single pianist and cellist gamely convey the essentials of Puccini’s score"

Rodula Gaitanou’s vital revival of Damiano Michieletto’s 2015 production reminds audiences how powerful both pieces are.Michieletto links these disparate stories of Italian village life by having characters in one piece reappear silently in the other – updating the original settings to the late 20th century does no harm.There is, however, occasional fussiness. Elena Zilio’s staunch Mamma Lucia pointlessly tears dough in the bakery while Elina Garanca’s luxuriantly sung Santuzza pours out her heart to her, and the coming to life of the statue of the Virgin is distinctly tacky.Otherwise, both operas are fortunate in having so many committed actors in their casts. Returning after an absence from this stage, Simon Keenlyside not only offers a vocally authoritative Tonio but his disturbingly sleazy characterisation is unmissable.Yet the overall vocal and dramatic honours must go to Bryan Hymel, originally cast as Turiddu in Mascagni’s opera, who also sings the role of Canio in Pagliacci to replace the absent Fabio Sartori. It’s a tour-de-force that he carries off with aplomb. Rarely has the final scene of Leoncavallo’s opera been so terrifying.Carmen Giannattasio’s impassioned Nedda also scores highly, giving as good as she gets until felled by the crazed Canio’s vicious blows, while Polish baritone Andrzej Filonczyk brings warmth and lyricism to her equally doomed lover, Silvio.Meanwhile in Cavalleria, Martina Belli shines as Santuzza’s scornful rival Lola while Mark S Doss gives Alfio genuine bite.Less impressive is some occasionally untidy orchestral playing and rhythmically slack conducting from Daniel Oren – but on stage, it’s an exceptional evening."

Her mother has settled for marriage and children, her sister Olga (a wholesome, sparky Felicity Buckland) is happy to do the same, but bookish Tatyana wants more.When Lensky, sung with comic ardour by Anthony Flaum, introduces his unattached friend Onegin, (Felix Kemp, a pleasing young baritone who could dial down the charm and increase the cynicism), Tatyana imagines romance. Soprano Lucy Hall sings prettily as the shy teenager, injects drama into her feverish Letter scene and emerges in the last act as a self-assured woman, a published author who rejects Onegin’s declaration of love.Theatrically, this Onegin works very well, thanks to Lucy Bradley’s clear, entertaining direction and Rosanna’s Vize’s simple set with its period detail (the Dansette, the cardigans and the waisted summer dresses). Mrs Larin (Kathryn Hannah) and her competent housekeeper Evie (Flora McIntosh) make a great double act, as do gossiping neighbours Joyce (Alexandra Stenson) and Carol (Caroline Daggett).Musically, the singing is excellent, but the opera cries out for the fullness and sweep of a bigger orchestra. OperaUpClose doesn’t skimp on the exciting, full-bodied sound of young, operatically trained voices, so why not complement them with a few more strings, woodwind or brass? "

Receiving its world premiere at the San Francisco Opera, it is set during the California Gold Rush, a period romanticised in the similarly titled Puccini opera.Adams mines a darker vein. His Gold Rush is gritty: the miners spend their hard-won gold on drink, gambling and prostitutes. They watch Lola Montez dance her provocative ‘spider dance’ and throw gold nuggets at touring thespians essaying Macbeth. Meanwhile, violence is rife and justice is served up by mobs. All of this is observed by Dame Shirley, the pen name of adventurer Louise Amelia Clappe, whose letters are the major source for the libretto by director Peter Sellars.Sellars’ well-chosen texts and Adams’ pulsating music work best in long arias, notably one based on a speech by the African American abolitionist and orator Frederick Douglass and sung by Ned Peters (Davone Tines), a fugitive slave. The arias come one after another in the second act, but, combined with the episodic framing of the Shirley letters, they lead to a certain narrative inertia, even if the period costumes and a fine bar-room set draw us into this unruly era.Adams’ score, well played by the San Francisco Opera under Grant Gershon, is his richest and most colourful yet. The vocal accolades go mostly to the female performers: the gleaming soprano of Julia Bullock in the key role of Dame Shirley; Hye Jung Lee, vibrant in the coloratura-in-extremis role of the prostitute Ah Sing and J’Nai Bridges, dignified and warm as Josefa Segovia. With the exception of Ned, the male roles are less sharply drawn, and the sudden violence of miners Clarence (a focused Ryan McKinny) and Joe Cannon (the well-rounded Paul Appleby) is never truly explained.Adams and Sellars aim to draw parallels between the chaos, racism, and misogyny of the Gold Rush era with our own, but the real treasure of this opera lies the extraordinary personal stories so bound up in this thankfully brief 19th-century era."

This elegant and lively inaugural production by OperaGlass Works, a new company founded by Selina Cadell and Eliza Thompson, evinces this, often wittily, without tipping into archness.In the demanding central role of Tom, Robert Murray proves an eminently likeable anti-hero, his deft dramatic touch complemented by glowing vocal lyricism.Like all the male singers he wears 18th century costume with modern black trousers. The women are in full period gear, and one fears for Susanna Hurrell’s safety as she climbs down a ladder from Wilton’s public balcony to the stepped wooden stage. Fortunately, her singing as Anne is as secure as her footwork; especially attractive in the lower registers. She acts with subtlety and candour.As the Mephistophelian Nick Shadow, Jonathan Lemalu – both genial and threatening – is enormously, fruitily resonant, while Victoria Simmonds’ glamorous, live wire Baba the Turk is alluring of voice.Stephen Richardson makes a powerful Trulove and Keeper of the House, Harry Nicoll camps it up pointedly as Sellem and Penelope Cousland brings a gleam to Mother Goose. The eight, fizzingly alert young singers of the chorus sing superbly.Occupying the rear of the stage – and sometimes engaged in the action – are the Southbank Sinfonia and conductor-harpsichordist Laurence Cummings, a Handel expert splendidly costumed as George Frideric himself. The warm Wilton’s acoustic takes some Stravinskian edge off the instrumental sound, but it shows off the singers – and their words – to ideal effect. "

Her fun-filled, Italian-sung production unfolds in 1920s America, handsomely captured by Hannah Clark’s art deco hotel set and inhabited by an assortment of stylish flappers and raffish consorts redolent of silent movie stars. The naivete and youthful idealism of two slightly gormless couples Ferrando (Sam Furness) and Dorabella (Heather Lowe), Guglielmo (Samuel Dale Johnson) and Fiordiligi (Kiandra Howarth) are held up for comparison with middle aged cynicism in the form of the housemaid Despina and the wordly Don Alfonso, played with suave sophistication by John Molloy.In making merry with the plot’s false identities and partner swopping, Thomas opts for a fast-paced comedic approach, which, at times, reduces the sublime music to background sound. Belfast soprano Aoife Miskelly is an engaging Despina, showing impressive physicality and fine vocal precision in switching roles between boozy wench and Chaplinesque doctor and notary.The performances of the star-struck lovers are at their most effective in reflective sections, where their vocal excellence is allowed to shine through unhindered.  But the somewhat overworked slapstick cannot disguise the queasy moral conclusion that all women are faithless while men are at liberty to betray friends and sweethearts simply because they can."

Initially announced in the role of Babylonian prince Assur – the chief villain of the piece – Ildebrando D’Arcangelo was replaced due to illness by Michele Pertusi; but on the first night Pertusi himself was taken ill and replaced during the interval by Mirco Palazzi, himself scheduled to take over the role for the final performance of the run.Pertusi’s indisposition clearly impacted on David Alden’s production (first seen in Munich in February), and the evening picked up from Palazzi’s first scene. Singing with firm tone and dramatic conviction, he helps give the enterprise greater security – and indeed it certainly needs some help at this point, and even later on.At nearly four hours in length, Rossini’s opera contains much magnificent music and some dramatic scenes, but the evening does not escape an intermittent sense of inertia.Alden exchanges ancient Babylon for some non-specific contemporary dictatorship, perhaps with Islamic resonances. Much of the action centring on betrayal and regicide, near-incest and retribution, remains clear, though the flapping golden sheath worn by Jacquelyn Stucker’s fluent Princess Azema, together with her alternating immobility and stumbling gait, are mystifying.For once, even Antonio Pappano’s conducting feels short on momentum; in one early chorus, the choral entries were consistently behind the beat.The chief compensations – and they are real enough – lie in the singing of the principals. Lawrence Brownlee has all the notes and a keen sense of style as Indian king Idreno. Daniela Barcellona is on unbeatable form as Semiramide’s long-lost son and innamorato Arsace, while in the title role Joyce DiDonato melds notes and drama together in a performance of extraordinary virtuosity and expressive mastery."

During the work’s creation he recalls the appearance of Hedren’s autobiography with its account of Alfred Hitchcock’s controlling and aggressively sexual predatory behaviour towards her; now the operatic Marnie receives its premiere at a time when similar ongoing revelations about the alleged behaviour of Harvey Weinstein and other celebrated figures in film and theatre are on everyone’s minds.Together with ENO’s top-quality cast, librettist Nicholas Wright, director Mayer and the composer handle difficult subject matter and some tricky scenes with sensitivity as well as responsibility.There are numerous differences from the plot of the Hitchcock version, among which the setting in 1950s England – evocatively conjured in the text with period references, and on stage by Julian Crouch and 59 Productions’ designs and Arianne Phillips’ sensational costumes – stands out.But in some respects the result feels not only more ambiguous in terms of the flawed yet fascinating central figures, but also more psychologically satisfying.Much of this is down to a score that shows a significant development in Muhly’s art, both in terms of technical skill and expressive power; he handles his forces with increased command as well as discretion, revealing the interiors of his complex characters. The result is an outstanding achievement.The show is also the first to be conducted by Martyn Brabbins since his appointment as the company’s music director, and he equally demonstrates complete authority. Bringing the entire and excellent orchestra onstage to take a bow at the end of the evening, meanwhile, was a moving gesture; with its own substantial role in the piece, ENO’s chorus too shows its collective mettle.But it is the quality of the central performances that sets the seal on a remarkable success. Highlighting the words as well as the lyricism of their vocal lines, Sasha Cooke’s Marnie and Daniel Okulitch’s Mark Rutland explore their characters’ complexity within an engrossing overview of their troubled and troubling relationship.Far more than mere decorative gestures are the regular appearances of the four ‘Shadow Marnies’, who add to our understanding of the central character’s fractured personality, while a sinister group of male dancers dressed like 1950s gumshoes attempts to hunt Marnie down.Elsewhere counter-tenor James Laing reveals the sheer creepiness of Mark’s twisted brother Terry, while Lesley Garrett steals a couple of scenes as their domineering mother. Kathleen Wilkinson and Diana Montague flesh out small but crucial parts as Marnie’s mum and her neighbour Lucy, while Alasdair Elliott seizes the opportunities granted to Marnie’s vengeful, petty-minded boss, Strutt."
81,Belongings review at Glyndebourne – ‘good intentions but lacks narrative strength’,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2017/belongings-review-at-glyndebourne-lewes-good-intentions-but-lacks-narrative-strength/,Belongings,Glyndebourne – ‘good intentions but lacks narrative strength’,Belongings review at Glyndebourne,3,2017-11-13,George Hall,"Glyndebourne has more experience in staging new youth operas than any other UK company. The work of composer Lewis Murphy and librettist Laura Attridge, Belongings examines the contemporary plight of child refugees in a scenario that juxtaposes their experiences with those of children evacuated from London during the Second World War (Glyndebourne housed many at the time) – though the Kindertransport of 1938-40 might have provided a more pertinent comparison.The company’s education department and creatives have nevertheless taken their task seriously: during the rehearsals refugees and asylum seekers shared their own experiences with company members, while earlier in the year the creative team travelled to Italy to work on pieces of theatre with others entering Europe from a variety of countries.Apart from the professionals involved, 65 young people aged nine to 19 are on stage, offering conviction in smaller roles and as members of the chorus, entering into both music and drama with confidence.Among those working alongside them is Rodney Earl Clarke, doubling as Ted in the 1940s scenes and aid worker Theo in the present-day ones; though his voice has lost power, his presence registers strongly. Leslie Davis gives a clear-eyed account of schoolteacher Helen and refugee Hallamah, with Nardus Williams making her mark as fellow refugee Marjana and Ted’s wife Maggie.But for all the production’s good intentions it lacks narrative strength: a sequence of scenes alternating the two periods needs more development than the 60-minute format permits.At times leaning towards the musical in style, Murphy’s highly traditional score is skilful but could do with a greater variety of pace. Lucy Bradley is responsible for the lively staging. Conducting members of the London Philharmonic Orchestra’s Foyle Future Firsts Development Ensemble who make up the accompanying orchestra, Lee Reynolds secures a neat musical account."

Random cruelty and stunning setbacks abound until the happily-ever-after part finally kicks in.In Jonathan Dove’s opera The Enchanted Pig (presented by Hampstead Garden Opera at Jacksons Lane), a princess is betrothed to a pig because she disobeyed her father. Worse, her equally naughty sisters make out rather better in the marriage stakes.Forced to wed her swinish swain (Dan D’Souza, making the most of a limited role), Princess Flora (an expressive Flora Macdonald) soon discovers he’s really a prince under the spell of an enchantress (a beguiling Christie Cook). Princess Flora puts on her iron boots to search the world for her porker prince, who’s earmarked by the enchantress for her selfish daughter, Adelaide.Adelaide (Anna Cavaliero) has the opera’s most memorable aria, a bridezilla rant that terrifies her cowed servants. It’s a coloratura gem with strong echoes of Sondheim. In this opera Dove treads frequently into the territory of high-end musicals otherwise occupied by the likes of Sondheim and Bernstein. There are also lashings of quotations from the operatic, pop and symphonic repertory (the opening of Janacek’s Sinfonietta, for one, and much Britten).Director Laura Attridge and movement director Caitlin Fretwell Walsh get the most out of their youthful cast, who play multiple roles in a tight ensemble. This deftly staged production also boasts witty costumes and well-considered lighting, along with a solid on-stage orchestra directed by Hannah Quinn. A special shout-out to cellist Mathieu Foubert for enhancing some tender scenes with his forays into his instrument’s highest registers.If I have a few quibbles about the vocal consistency of some of the young performers, and I find the stage fog to be a cough-inducing distraction, I am on the whole entirely under the spell of this production of The Enchanted Pig. It’s a hugely enjoyable evening of light-hearted music featuring energetic and well-directed performers."

Brook’s original conception was stark and stripped-down, but here there is a black lametta curtain, a stage-wide staircase and singers in garish modern dress – though Don Jose initially channels Che Guevara with his beard and military fatigues.While Carmen mixes drama and comedy, Jones’ favoured tone is sometimes embarrassingly tongue-in-cheek. In particular, roaring baritone Gyula Nagy sends up the bullfighter Escamillo something rotten, and while Micaela is sumptuously sung by Francesca Chiejina, she lacks toughness.Thomas Atkins, as the increasingly manic Don Jose, exudes the greatest intensity and his narrow-bore tenor suits French music. He is also the only singer to get the French text across with consistent success. Aigul Akhmetshina strikes seductive poses and sounds opulent, but, if she is to exercise her supposedly endless fascination, Carmen’s words need to mean something.The evening’s greatest pleasure comes from the stylish playing of the Southbank Sinfonia, placed at the back of the stage, and the often exquisitely-judged conducting of James Hendry."

Together, violin/viola and bassoon, harp, percussion and piano romp and sigh through a plethora of styles and references from Stravinsky to Walton himself in support of a fine comedy trio cast.The mutual taming is directed with crisp irreverence by Richard Studer, set in a domestic dacha and framed by black drapes and birch tree lights. Smirnov (Adam Green), a boorish bear of a salesman, confronts the widow Popova (Carolyn Dobbin) about an unpaid debt, and the gags fly fast, furious and vodka-soaked.From initial repugnance to eventual love via a charmingly ludicrous would-be duel, bombast, vanity and guile meet faux grief and, well, bombast, vanity and guile. Vocally and amorously it’s an adroitly comic match, pointed with pratfall splendour by the long-suffering servant, Luka (Matthew Buswell).The evening’s second half comprises titbits from MWO’s forthcoming main-stage Eugene Onegin – plus Scheherazade, Die Fledermaus and more, veering into deadpan territory not so far removed from Walton. Dobbin’s vodka-swilling Orlofsky is an unexpected treat. "

Trapped in a confined space with a vigorous 12-piece orchestra and three male singers, the tension for the audience becomes almost unbearable.The young Shadwell Ensemble, conducted by Finnegan Downie Dear, gives a raw, sometimes overwhelming account of a score ranging from brutal 20th-century modernism to pastiche music-hall tunes.It’s not just the big brass and percussion effects that assault the senses – the strobe of the lighthouse beam and flashes of lightning batter the eyeballs and a queasy rocking effect is created by projecting the movement of water in a fish tank onto a screen. The set focuses on a central ring containing a kitchen table, ankle-deep in water, where the three keepers slosh around and wrestle with their inner demons.Pauls Putnins plays the driven preacher Arthur, his magnificent bass full of blood and thunder; baritone Owain Browne is Blazes, whose gruesome song reveals he is both abused and an abuser. The most affecting of the three is boyish tenor Paul Curievci as Sandy – his cliched love song arouses tenderness in his two companions. They embrace in a rare moment of cameraderie before their crazy visions drive them towards their hellish fate.Like  “the horror!” in Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, the audience is left with a feeling of dread, but no clear idea of who dunnit, or what was done. It doesn’t matter – Furness and Downie Dear have created a spine-chilling setting for this operatic shaggy dog story."

This allows Mitchell to fill out Lucia’s story. While the men are singing Donizetti’s score we can watch Lucia murdering her husband Arturo and later cutting her wrists in the stylish copper bath.The cast is outstanding, especially the Lucia of Cuban-American soprano Lisette Oropesa. A consummate actor with a fresh, pearly sound and exquisite top notes, Oropesa creates a flesh-and-blood character out of Donizetti’s sketchy heroine. Her mad scene is beautifully judged, full of nuance and changes of pace – deeply disturbing rather than tragic – and her tender relationship with Alisa (superbly acted by Rachel Lloyd) is the most honest in this ghastly story.Lucia’s lover, Edgardo, is the ardent tenor Charles Castronovo, and her stuffed-shirt brother Enrico, who marries her off to save the family fortune, is Christopher Maltman, suppressing his sunny baritone to produce grim, sepulchral tones. Michele Pertusi as the sympathetic chaplain Raimondo and Konu Kim, in the thankless role of Arturo, are well characterised.Under the baton of bel canto expert Michele Mariotti, the chorus and orchestra relish Donizetti’s lively score and harp and flute both have fine solo moments. "
87,"Don Giovanni review at Pleasance Theatre, London – ‘a provocative idea’",https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2017/don-giovanni-review-pleasance-theatre-london/,Don Giovanni,Pleasance Theatre,London,3,2017-10-27,Inge Kjemtrup,"Directors of Mozart’s Don Giovanni are often seduced into seeking out a plausible explanation for the title character’s unrepentant womanising.For the all-female creative team behind HeadFirst Production’s Don Giovanni, Mozart’s anti-hero is a sociopath playing a deceitful game that he knows will destroy him. The female characters are often complicit in his game – how could they not be, when Don Giovanni understands their desires all too well?Director Sophie Gilpin and her colleagues want to explore the “fine line between seduction and sexual manipulation”, a provocative idea in an era when every news cycle seems to turn up another high-profile serial sexual abuser. Yet in framing Don Giovanni as a dark catalogue of sexual conquests, the production diminishes the wit that is also part and parcel of this opera.The opening night performance at the Pleasance Theatre was dogged by bad luck, including a soprano (Elizabeth Roberts) suffering an asthma attack, an instrumentalist beset by a coughing fit, and backstage activities that were distractingly audible. Meanwhile, the staging advantages of Anna Bonomelli’s rotating set are diminished by the fact that performers have to dodge the hands of the giant clock at the centre.As Giovanni, Matthew Sprange has the braggadocio but not the swagger, though his serenade to a naïve maid is charming. His opportunistic servant, Leporello (Samuel Pantcheff) offers a confident rendition of the famous aria that enumerates his employer’s many conquests.Caroline Modiba is a fine Donna Anna, her soprano shining in the aria she sings to her long-suffering fiance, Don Ottavio (Jorge Navarro Colorado) in the second act. As Zerlina, Sian Cameron shows a young woman torn between her new husband, Masetto (Ian Beadle), and the alluring Giovanni, while Roberts effectively portrays the conflicted Donna Elvira. The three women have their victory over Don Giovanni in the end, but it is an ambiguous triumph."

The surreally outsized columnar memorial to Bertarido, its base alone filling the height of the stage, makes a bold impression, as do the two video clips that animate it.The silent role of the child Flavio is cast as an adult (understatedly, yet virtuosically played by Matt Casey), giving unfiltered physical expression to his feelings. You’d expect nothing less inventive or colourful from Jones but the concept is slightly let down by fussy distractions during some arias, and a seeming desire to play for laughs in final act.Rebecca Evans returns to the title role, dramatic rather than crystalline; Tim Mead sounds effortless as Bertarido, whether in rage or rapture; Juan Sancho and Neal Davies give fine performances as Grimoaldo and Garibaldo respectively; and Susan Bickley commands the stage as Bertarido’s scheming sister, Eduige. Christian Curnyn conducts with exemplary flair."

Now it returns for the company’s autumn tour. The cast this time is less starry, but everyone impresses, both vocally and dramatically, including Jennifer France’s intense Ophelia, Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts’s menacing Polonius, William Dazeley’s villainous Claudius and Brian Bannatyne-Scott’s dour gravedigger.David Butt Philip makes a strong impact in the title role, handling the demanding vocal lines with aplomb, although his prancing, falsetto-voiced madness is a shade too Monty Python to be taken seriously.Neil Armfield’s modern-dress production conveys the action clearly without feeling rushed, despite the drastic abridgement, and Dean’s well-crafted, darkly brooding score captures the essence of the tragedy – or, at least, one aspect of it. The orchestral writing is viscerally powerful, with off-stage chorus, surround-sound electronics and microtones adding to the unsettling mood.The problem is that, played out over three hours, the music’s relentlessness becomes increasingly wearing. The best Shakespeare operas – such as Verdi’s Otello or Britten’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream – succeed because their composers encapsulateShakespeare’s universality, both light and shade. Despite its considerable strengths, and a few moments of levity – most effectively the semitone-duetting Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, delightful John Inman-channeling cameos from countertenors Rupert Enticknap and James Hall – Dean’s score unfolds as a disappointingly monochrome take on this most famous of tragedies. The brutal conclusion is appropriately epic, but merely shocking rather than heartbreaking, without the rays of hope that are so crucial to Shakespeare’s masterpiece."

He made a decent job of that, though was inevitably blamed for his talent not matching his predecessor’s genius. None of Alfano’s own dozen or so operas has remained in the repertoire.But there are occasional revivals of two or three, especially the 1904 Risurrezione, based on Tolstoy’s novel Resurrection and an obvious work for the Wexford Festival to turn its attention to.In this clear-eyed production by Rosetta Cucchi, to realistic and strongly atmospheric designs by Tiziano Santi and Claudia Pernigotti, Risurrezione certainly makes an impression: the narrative describing the central characters’ dual redemption is undoubtedly moving and is handled here with impeccable skill.Right at the centre comes an individual performance of exceptional dramatic conviction – that of Anne Sophie Duprels as Katiusha, whose young life is destroyed by her seduction by the prince in the house where she is his aunt’s companion, but who eventually achieves spiritual renewal even amidst the degradation of a Siberian prison camp.Singing with force and vigour, Australian tenor Gerard Schneider delivers a memorable account of Dimitri, the prince whose carelessly cruel act precipitates Katiusha’s disastrous fall but who belatedly attempts to make amends. Baritone Charles Rice, meanwhile, convinces as Simonson, the political convict who inspires Katiusha with his humanistic vision and whom she eventually agrees to marry despite her continuing love for Dimitri.In a performance less committed or stylistically secure than this one, the score’s limitations in terms of its lack of strong musical ideas would be more apparent, but here conductor Francesco Cilluffo, the full cast and Wexford’s orchestra give it all they’ve got."

But Tom Green is alert to the irony and deliberately takes it further, weaving a powerfully eclectic score – for soprano Amanda Forbes, the all-female Mavron String Quartet and live loop pedals – from the music of unfairly neglected women composers: Barbara Strozzi, Clara Schumann, Elizabeth Lutyens and more.Is it presumptive or manipulative? Or an opportunity to consider the ubiquity of the male authorial voice, and associated ‘undoing of women’ in opera? Or, deeper still, testimony that opera subverts conventions of otherness and difference through the agency of the performative, singing voice?Each of these questions smartly underscores Green’s 11 settings thanks to his subtle musical imagination and – not least – a compelling, literally multilayered performance by Forbes, strongly supported by the Mavron.Director Ed Madden and designer Grace Smart place marble busts on plinths as cold, unfeeling signposts to Forbes’ expressivity.It’s an intimate experience, and Green avoids straying into the overtly polemical, painting the sharp wit and emotional push-me-pull-you of Duffy’s poetry within a transparent tapestry of renaissance-to-contemporary, sometimes atonal sound. Sensitively wrought, the female composers, too, are poignantly invoked. "

In the opening party scene, every element serves the storytelling. The party-goers are literally dancing on Violetta’s grave.Gulnara Shafigullina plays Violetta as a dead woman walking. Clearly aware of her impending death, she barely engages with her guests. Her rich full voice seems to agree, holding back on the high notes in a way that she never does once she has reached the county with Alfredo.Violetta’s true tragedy, presented via Alfredo’s memory of events, is not so much her demise but the fact that she never finds a man who does not put himself first.With his round tones, Peter Gijsbertsen’s Alfredo crows about the purity of their love, but when it comes to loss and regret, he makes it all about his sorrow. Stephen Gadd’s commanding Giorgio Germont, meanwhile, oozes self-importance.It is a reading which, combined with such punctilious attention to the characterisation – and a deliciously salacious Spanish dance in Flora’s party – makes the impeccably paced final scene all the more heart-rending. "

Thirteen years after Cherubini’s death the German composer Franz Lachner turned the spoken dialogue into recitative. Decades later his all-sung version was translated into Italian – and in this form the work eventually reached its widest public as a vehicle for Maria Callas.Instead of going back to the French original, however, Wexford’s Lachner-based Italian-language edition adds in bits of dialogue whose effect hampers the dramatic flow.Herself a famous exponent of Medea, director Fiona Shaw might have been expected to provide a gripping realisation of Cherubini’s score, but it has eluded her: designer Annemarie Woods’ bathetic visual mixture of the 18th century and the contemporary domestic proves more hindrance than help, a low point being reached when one of the principals trips over a gigantic rock that is quite literally in the way.Rising star dramatic soprano Lise Davidsen often blazes away thrillingly, but the intensity of the title-role is way beyond her and her Italian often indecipherable. The other principals – Ruth Iniesta’s Glauce, Raffaella Lupinacci’s Neris, Adam Lau’s Creon and especially Sergey Romanovsky’s bright-toned Jason – are creditable; but Stephen Barlow’s conducting also fatally lacks electricity."

References to the theatre’s famous ballet company, whose female members dance regularly throughout The Sicilian Vespers, are also a constant – somewhat ironically, given that the score’s main extended formal ballet sequence is actually cut; in any case it scarcely needs pointing out that the issues in the opera are somewhat bigger than the history of any particular opera house, however distinguished.Herheim’s direction is self-advertising, occasionally naughty and once or twice outrageous – but you cannot take your eyes off it. Perverse or not, the result is theatrically brilliant, while the central performances and relationships, though admittedly drawn with a broad brush-stroke, are conceived along the right lines.More crucially the main roles are all impressively sung; indeed the general vocal standard over a lengthy and demanding evening is sky-high. Erwin Schrott sings magnificently as the fanatical Sicilian patriot Procida, with Bryan Hymel tireless as his compromised associate Henri and Malin Bystrom (the only one of the four principals new to the show this time around) technically and emotionally assured as the Duchess Helene.Michael Volle has to work harder as the bullying French governor Guy de Montfort, but despite some effortful moments he more than earns his position amidst an outstanding quartet.Maurizio Benini conducts, with less sheer panache than Antonio Pappano brought to the original, but the company’s choral and orchestral forces are on focused form."

On this particular evening Janacek’s semi-autobiographical Osud (Destiny) is twinned with Bernstein’s wry little comedy, Trouble in Tahiti.First on the bill, Osud is by far the tougher nut to crack. Already the composer of Jenufa – widely acknowledged as his first stage masterpiece – Janacek next turned to this piece inspired by a brief romantic involvement he experienced in a Czech spa town.The result is a freewheeling fantasy in which the central character, the composer Zivny, stands in for Janacek himself, while the woman with whom he was infatuated turns up as Mila – a character who meets a bizarre death in the course of the opera due to an accident caused by her mentally unstable mother.Unfortunately the result is problematic on both dramatic and musical levels, and it is not difficult to comprehend why the piece failed to reach the stage in Janacek’s lifetime, nor why it has enjoyed such limited success since its posthumous stage premiere in 1958.Opera North nevertheless fields a strong cast, with John Graham-Hall focused as the troubled Zivny, Giselle Allen engaged as the unlucky Mila and the redoubtable Rosalind Plowright electrifying as her mother; but despite everyone’s best efforts, including those of Opera North’s excellent choral and orchestral forces under conductor Martin Andre, Annabel Arden’s production cannot salvage the piece.Fortunately Matthew Eberhardt’s sparky staging of Bernstein’s witty, heart-breaking account of a failing marriage in 1950s American suburbia comes to the rescue. Dapper Quirijn de Lang offers a flawless portrayal of go-getting businessman Sam opposite the elegant Wallis Giunta, who offers immaculate lyricism as his frustrated homemaking wife, Dinah.Conductor Tobias Ringborg leads a vital version of the jazz-inflected score, while Charles Edwards’ designs conjure up the period perfectly."

It’s a suitably eerie fit for the Grimm tale: a vast Victorian museum after hours, full of glass cabinets stuffed with old toys – even if the voices of the five-strong cast get swallowed a little in the vaulted ceiling.Polly Leech and Sofia Larsson play Hansel and Gretel manically and energetically, romping around the stage area like a couple of chaotic kids high on orange squash. Leech’s thick, penetrating mezzo-soprano is a particular highlight, and it pairs well with Larsson’s bright soprano, accompanied brilliantly by Berrak Dyer on the piano.In her hairnet and overalls Ailsa Mainwaring is less gruesome witch and more overbearing dinnerlady but, whatever, it works. Her big grin alone is enough to make kids stay away.Curt, colloquial subtitles shrink recitative into irreverent plot summaries, but as the production goes on these become increasingly obnoxious and self-satisfied, with ‘contemporary’ references irritatingly shoe-horned in. They’re part of Pop-Up Opera’s aesthetic, but very much an acquired taste.Budget restraints mean that James Hurley’s production has had to cut the scene that sees 14 angels dance around the sleeping children in the middle of the forest, but Pop-Up Opera are as resourceful as ever and use the strength of the piece, and of their clear production, to make up for most shortcomings."

Arden’s visual references are a Spanish pick-and-mix ranging from Goya’s The Clothed Maja to the couturier Cristobal Balenciaga. The deconstructed and descending harpsichords at the end of Act I may have been a homage to Dali, but their impact is minimal.Of the main characters, Rosina, the imprisoned young ward of the gold-digger Bartolo is clearly single-minded, if under-defined. Vocally, though, Laura Verrecchia delivers the role with a fruity tone and reserves of power. Indeed, the individual performances are all very impressive.American baritone Tobias Greenhalgh’s Figaro is quick-witted as well as comical – his is more than the typical Jack-the-lad portrayal. Marco Filippo Romano successfully goes for believability over buffoonery as Bartolo and tenor Jack Swanson proves himself a talent to watch as Almaviva, with a ringing upper register and a knee-weakening lyric sense.Janis Kelly steals the show as the housemaid Berta, at first sternly disapproving but later reviving the frolics of her youth. Despite a few moments of wobbly ensemble work between the singers and orchestra, Ben Gernon conducts with spirit and dramatic insight."

In this autumn’s jaunt around a total of 21 venues, it presents major works by Handel and Bach (not an opera, of course, but the B minor Mass), while playing in six of them Rameau’s ‘tragedie en musique’ Dardanus – a work totally unfamiliar to UK audiences until quite recently.Despite receiving a no doubt inordinately lavish initial staging, this mythological tale about the love of Jupiter’s son Dardanus for Iphise, daughter of his enemy Teucer, and his rivalry with Antenor, initially enjoyed limited success at the Paris Opera in 1739, though it did better in a heavily revised form five years later after the last three of its five acts had been completely rewritten; the version ETO plays is essentially the latter, with some further alterations from subsequent runs.Importantly, conductor and Rameau expert Jonathan Williams helps the cast and orchestra – The Old Street Band, which has never sounded more confident than it does this season – to achieve a credible realisation of the composer’s recondite style that gives the show a solid musical foundation.Douglas Rintoul’s efficient staging is founded on Cordelia Chisholm’s solid set, which has already done duty for Giulio Cesare Parts I and II. Despite the contemporary military fatigues being a current cliché for any conflict setting, no matter where or when, and visually dull at that – at least compared with anything Rameau’s audiences would have expected – the result, aided by subtle and imaginative lighting by Mark Howland, proves effective.So do the central performances, with Grant Doyle’s grandly emphatic Teucer, Anthony Gregory’s vocally pliant Dardanus – well able to manage the high-lying line – Galina Averina’s anxious Iphise, Timothy Nelson’s antagonistic Antenor and Frederick Long’s magician Ismenor all clearly positioned within the overall picture."

Indeed, Janacek became haunted by “that black opera of mine” as he wrestled with its cast of thieves, murderers, thugs and tyrants.Yet the result, while harrowingly unflinching, proves an extraordinary paean to the human spirit and its capacity for wisdom, humour and compassion, even at its most desperate or depraved.Sublimely at one, director/translator David Pountney and conductor Tomas Hanus draw us into the very heart of the piece in this venerable Welsh National Opera revival, laying bare Janacek’s radical, cinematic vision with a breathtaking combination of rawness and gentleness.The house of the dead is an underworld; not just of criminals but, within the blasted ruins of a workhouse/riverbank/hospital, a hell in which a dreadful outside world is distilled. Yet, just like new arrival Goryanchikov (Ben McAteer), a broken-winged eagle survives to eventually fly free.From strident folk chorus to impassioned monologue via madcap pantomime, with a myriad characterisations the singers are stupendous. Among others, Mark Le Brocq (Luka/Filka), Robert Hayward (Commandant), and especially Simon Bailey (Shishkov) – and Welsh National Opera chorus – deserve particular praise, coming hotfoot from Khovanshchina, the opera’s blood-brother in this Russian-themed season.They are matched in intensity by a WNO orchestra absolutely committed from tinnitus-high piccolo to sepulchral contrabassoon. Vivid, colourful and dissonantly alive, Janacek’s authentic scoring is heard here for the first time in John Tyrell’s painstaking new edition.It’s a shattering experience but ultimately uplifting: a fantastic company achievement."

The revival director is again Peter Relton, with whom Miller appears on stage to a partial standing ovation on first night.With Leiser and Caurier’s day-glo production featuring regularly at Covent Garden, this venerable mix of British farce and commedia dell’arte feels as comfortable as an old shoe.Never one of Miller’s time-shifting high-concept reassessments, it retells the familiar story deftly, with comic detail precisely observed. Only Tanya McCallin’s period costumes and sets have begun to look dowdy, the main problem being not so much the distressed plasterwork as the redundant canopy of old sheets.As in 2015, Count Almaviva is well acted by small-voiced Mexican tenor Eleazar Rodriguez, while Australian high baritone Morgan Pearse reprises his rather wooden Figaro; he has the decibels but produces some edgy tone. Both improve as the evening progresses.ENO regular Sarah Tynan scores a personal triumph with her first Rosina. No longer the soubrette, she is almost too commanding and manipulative to make us feel for her character’s plight, the coloratura realised with impressive skill and confidence.Alan Opie, the show’s first Figaro in 1987, has now graduated to the role of Dr Bartolo and proves adept at his comic business. So too is Alastair Miles’ Basilio. Such luxury casting does highlight the relative ordinariness of the male leads.Although the orchestra is reduced in size, the approach of conductor Hilary Griffiths is essentially old-world lyrical, never forcing the pace or drowning the cast. His is an overdue ENO debut. Harpsichord rather than fortepiano accompanies the recitatives, which, alone, are not surtitled."

But playing this extensive piece in two parts creates its own problems.The second part makes an error right at the start: it repeats a large chunk of the original work’s second act that the audience has already experienced at the end of Part 1, The Death of Pompey. Not only is this material redundant, but it lengthens unnecessarily what is already a substantial evening. While audiences in some centres can hear the two parts on different evenings, others will hear them on the same day; presumably they will get this mammoth repetition too.Apart from that, the second part has a lot to commend it, with Cordelia Chisholm’s elegant set once more providing an attractive frame and her 18th-century costumes suggesting character as well as period.There is plenty of character in the individual performances, too, including – crucially – in the singing, which maintains a high standard that is nevertheless let down here and there by weak diction. Whatever the language – the opera is sung here in the original Italian – we need to hear the words.That said, there is much to admire in the company’s work. In Part II, Christopher Ainslie’s Caesar steals the show with a breathtaking aria sequence that he brings off with resounding success, but there’s also skilled and memorable work from Benjamin Bevan’s villainous Achilla, Benjamin Williamson’s craven Tolomeo and Frederick Long’s Curio, while the Old Street Band has another good night under Jonathan Peter Kenny’s enlivening baton."

The first half covers Act I and much of Act II of the original.The result is still a substantial evening, and there’s no denying the quality of the performance. Placing the piece in the year of its original production, Cordelia Chisholm’s handsome set and costumes offer one of the company’s finest ever shows visually, while Conway’s direction is both astute and detailed.The plot describes Caesar arriving in Egypt to be greeted by the gift of the disembodied head of his rival, Pompey, removed by the local ruler, Tolomeo, whose sister Cleopatra vies with him for the throne and decides to seduce Caesar in order to gain it.Both vocally and dramatically the cast is well up to the demands of Handel’s music and successful in supplying decorations which add to its expressive virtuosity. Soraya Mafi’s Cleopatra charts Handel’s delicate but ornate lines with skill, though she could do with clearer diction. Catherine Carby delineates the proud grief of Pompey’s widow, Cornelia, while Kitty Whately is outstanding as her son Sesto.Countertenor Christopher Ainslie commands the stage as Caesar, and there’s strong support from Frederick Long as his officer Curio, Benjamin Williamson as Tolomeo and Thomas Scott-Cowell as Cleopatra’s counsellor, Nireno.Conductor Jonathan Peter Kenny, meanwhile, galvanises the Old Street Band in their historically informed articulation of the score.Read review of Giulio Cesare Part II: Cleopatra’s Needle here"

But compromise his scale and pacing, and shrink his glamorous orchestration (even to a not unevocative trio of piano, cello and clarinet), and you render his thriller less fail-safe.This is the King’s Head Theatre’s last pub opera before its move to a new theatre next door. The company is going out with several bangs, since all three protagonists in this Tosca die by pistol – no knife or suicide leap here.Director Adam Spreadbury-Maher updates the action to occupied Paris in 1944. Not the first to shift the action from its specific setting of Rome in 1800, he supports his case with a radical and resourceful adaptation of the text. Made in collaboration with his soprano, Becca Marriott, it cites the Normandy landings, Auschwitz and does some cutting and rearranging.Despite numerous deft and inventive touches, the newly intimate drama – even when it gets violent – never quite achieves a theatrical kill, and Puccini’s sweeping scheme – so compelling and suspenseful in a full-blown production – ends up weighing the show down.Willowy and highly strung, Marriott’s Tosca is sung with formidable point and accuracy, while Roger Paterson’s engagingly boyish Cavaradossi (here Cavaradain) is poetically voiced. As Scarpia, Michael Georgiou, marvellously moustachioed and blue-chinned and phrasing with flair, plays the sadistic Gestapo chief so cool that he forgets to be frightening.Doubling as Angelotti (here Jacob Cohen) and Spoletta (Alexandre Villaplane), the energetic Thomas Isherwood unleashes a powerful baritone of exciting potential."

Even so, director James Macdonald, reviving his 2004 production for the Russian Revolution season at Welsh National Opera, appears to take literally the composer’s insistence that the work is really just a series of “lyrical scenes”; with long breaks between these – and two intervals, returning to essentially the same bare, angular set – Macdonald risks adding the wrong kind of weight to proceedings.That and Tobias Hoheisel’s coldly bisected designs hardly facilitate Tchaikovsky’s searing contrasts of inner turbulence with outer manners, rustic hubbub with metropolitan whirl. Instead, the onus is firmly on the singers and WNO orchestra (conducted with occasional rhythmic looseness by Ainars Rubikis) to pinpoint the necessary distinctions through yearning tension-cum-lovelorn bitterness.That they largely succeed is testament to their individual and collective artistry. Soprano Natalya Romaniw proves a magnificent Tatyana: lustrous of voice and beautifully poised, hers is no simplistic giddy girl-to-grande dame transformation, but a nuanced portrait of wisdom hard-gained.Nipped cruelly in the bud is the touching Olga-Lensky pairing of Claudia Huckle and Jason Bridges, while Onegin himself, passionately sung by Nicholas Lester, cuts a grimly funereal, then desperate, Byronic figure. Miklos Sebestyen lends nobility as Prince Gremin, while the WNO chorus sings – and dances – with gusto regardless of cramped surroundings."

Deemed the more technically sophisticated of these two pieces written at the start of the Italian verismo (‘realist’) period, Pagliacci usually brings the evening to its blood-and-thunder close.Here, in Charles Edwards’ self-designed staging, it launches it in effective fashion, even if the concept stretches the material in ways that don’t really add up. It is set in the present, at the rehearsals of an opera, where jealous, drunken director/tenor Canio eventually stabs to death his unfaithful soprano wife and her lover the conductor.But Leoncavallo’s opera proves strong enough to withstand such idiosyncrasies, especially given the confident commitment of vocal performances led by Peter Auty’s troubled Canio, Elin Pritchard’s vibrant Nedda, Richard Burkhard’s venomous Tonio and Phillip Rhodes’ sensitive Silvio.For once Pag is outflanked by Cav – to use the colloquial titles opera fans invariably employ – despite Polish director Karolina Sofulak’s even greater freedom with Mascagni’s material. From late-19th-century Sicily she moves Cavalleria Rusticana to her Catholic homeland in the 1980s, when Santuzza has acquired an obsessive mania for religion and much of the love-triangle-with-extras plot is seen through the distorting mirror of her emotional and sexual fantasies.Once again, something that shouldn’t work takes off in the most extraordinary way. Giselle Allen’s Santuzza, in particular, reaches terrifying levels of intensity, and she’s outstandingly partnered by Jonathan Stoughton’s village stud Turiddu, Phillip Rhodes’ straight-down-the-line betrayed husband Alfio, Katie Bray’s risk-taking Lola and Rosalind Plowright’s virtually omnipresent Mamma Lucia.Conductor Tobias Ringborg draws performances from the company’s orchestral and choral forces to match those of the principals, and the two visceral operas hit you right where it hurts."

This autumn it revives the idea with six more works you can book individually or see in various matching pairs.Here, Trial by Jury, the Gilbert and Sullivan parody of a court case in which Edwin is sued by Angelina for breach of promise of marriage, is paired with the Ravel/Colette lyric fantasy L’Enfant Et Les Sortileges, in which a destructive child is tamed when the objects he has damaged come to life and he learns empathy.John Savournin updates Trial by Jury to the 1930s, preceding it with a new and unnecessary, if harmless, prologue in which the story is introduced by a Hedda Hopper-like gossip columnist, an invented character given camp swagger by Amy J Payne. After this the show continues merrily along its half-amiable, half-acidic path, appealingly sung and fluently acted by members of the company’s chorus.Shining particularly brightly are Amy Freston’s manipulative Plaintiff, Nicholas Watts’ cocky Defendant and Jeremy Peaker’s outrageous Learned Judge. Oliver Rundell conducts a bright and breezy account of the score and the designs by Charles Edwards and Gabrielle Dalton are unfailingly clever.Edwards works the trick again in tandem with Hannah Clark in Annabel Arden’s staging of L’Enfant Et Les Sortileges, which increases steadily in visual magic from a deliberately ordinary start.Opera North fields one of its characteristic ensemble casts, with Wallis Giunta taking the lead as the naughty boy who becomes kind and Ann Taylor touching the heart as his Mother, also tripling up as the Chinese Cup and the Squirrel – a trick several other members of the team bring off with equal aplomb.Martin Andre is in charge of the subtle and sophisticated score, while the company’s orchestra and chorus provide genuine aural enchantment to match the visuals."

Set in ancient Egypt, and with temple scenes and triumphal processions crucial to the plot, it’s an opera with blockbuster values. Little wonder then that past productions have featured live elephants on stage and taken place in front of the pyramids at Giza.This new Aida that opens English National Opera’s season offers a spectacle of a different kind. There are no elephants, but plenty of thrills are to be had from the fantastic costumes, dramatic lighting, well-paced direction and the inclusion of members of theatre company Improbable as non-singing extras.Director Phelim McDermott, the co-founder of Improbable, puts the love triangle front and centre – the Egyptian warrior Radames, the Pharaoh’s daughter Amneris, and the Ethiopian slave Aida, whose father is, inconveniently for her romantic desires, King Amonasro of Ethiopia, who is leading his troops against Egypt. Tom Pye’s striking, block-like sets allow for both the intimate scenes with the four principal characters that dominate the final two acts and the crowd scenes every Aida fan rightfully expects.The singers are excellent, with American soprano Latonia Moore, new to ENO but not to Aida, bringing a wide dramatic and vocal range to the role. Her lament for her homeland in Act III is especially affecting. Gwyn Hughes Jones as Radames is full of the stuff heroic tenors are made of, while there’s good characterisation from Musa Ngqungwana as Aida’s father, Robert Winslade Anderson as the chief priest and Michelle DeYoung as the anguished Amneris. Keri-Lynn Wilson keeps firm rein of the ENO orchestra while the chorus provides astounding moments of soft clarity.Kevin Pollard’s eye-popping costumes nearly steal the show. As well as the Issey Miyake-gone-feral dresses worn by Amneris, there’s the excessive brocade on Radames’ uniform and the flowing red drapery on the High Priestess (an excellent Eleanor Dennis) and her acolytes. Sometimes this Aida is so visually arresting that it’s hard to know where to look next: a benchmark for a spectacle if there ever was one."

Now Highbury Opera Theatre has brought the story into the operatic league for the first time.The game-plan is sound, combining the popularity of the beautiful game with the resonance of Arsenal’s nearby Highbury home. Speaking from the pulpit is the Commentator and among the worshippers are choirs of local adults and children in their red and whites, adding their own chants and commentary.There’s only one major role, that of the central fan, Gooner – Nick in the book – but Tenor Robin Bailey tackles it with vocal attractiveness and an unstintingly naturalistic, understated flair that brings rich credibility to his journey from first match through unhealthy fixation to, finally even if temporarily, reaching a football/life balance.Fever Pitch the opera is a game of two halves. Composer Scott Stroman (who conducts the snappy 10-piece ensemble) has written a score that plays to his strengths as a respected jazz musician, but the result, often sounding like a substitute for West Side Story waiting in the wings, creates a stylistic clash that is baffling.Stylised waltzes, latino rhythms and big-band punches can’t bring much to bear upon football fanaticism. Skilfully crafted, colourful and brilliantly played as the music is – sitting in a jazz club, for example, you’d be made up – in the context of an opera about football, it’s like turning up to a match to find that the players are rolling around on bouncy castles."

Left unfinished at his untimely death, the opera plunges into the lethal politics of 17th-century Russia; a nation seething with factional intrigue and religious fanaticism which – not for the first or last time in its ongoing story – bring it to the brink of reform or collapse.Director David Pountney revives his deeply intelligent, Soviet-inspired 2007 production to stunning effect for Welsh National Opera’s Russian Revolution season, bringing cinematic sweep to 20th-century analogies all-too relevant to present times.Amidst the grey, constructivist ruins of office/palace/city square, terrified peasants and Streltsy overseers alike become prospective collateral damage as polity battles rage between their aristocratic masters. The one ash-robed, the other spattered with spilt blood and wine, each lowly collective is powerfully given voice by the WNO chorus.The cast, too, sing wonderfully. For the Khovanskys (a superbly afflicted Robert Hayward and brutish Adrian Dwyer), ecstasy and perversion elide as their plot against the Tsar unravels. Ivan is murdered by Golitsyn (a ruthless Mark Le Brocq) post-enjoyment of his Persian sex slave (Beate Vollack): Andrei perishes alongside Old Believers who, at the behest of Miklós Sebestyén’s chillingly persuasive Dosifei, play follow-my-leader to the gas chamber rather than breathe a new atmosphere of change.Hence Marfa (Sara Fulgoni) – the abused lover-turned-martyr who flits between factions like a magical moth of doom – gets her self-destroying revenge and supposed release.As a metaphor for any people’s fate, it’s horrifyingly bleak. But in Shostakovich’s marvellous orchestration, the score resounds with life and colour, thanks also to a WNO orchestra on top form under conductor, Tomas Hanus. Unmissable. "

For this flying visit by a European company that is an offshoot of the Armel Opera Festival, Hungarian conductor Peter Eotvos presents one of his recent works, intended to be a companion piece to Bartok’s powerful one-act opera, Bluebeard’s Castle.Setting an Italian libretto derived by Eotvos’ wife Mari Mezei from the 2002 novel Without Blood by Alessandro Baricco, the new work depicts a man and a woman with a complex past meeting again after decades: he has been involved with the murder of her father and her brother, though at the same time he has saved her from his accomplices.Dramatically, there’s an enigmatic quality to the result, with the audience only gradually working out the character’s mutual backstory.Eotvos’s bitty score draws on a wide range of modernist gestures without managing to maintain a clear thread through its own material, but the two central performances – Romain Bockler’s Pedro and Albane Carrere’s Nina – hold the attention in Robert Alfoldi’s spare production.The playing of the large Pannon Philharmonic Orchestra, which fills the stalls at Hackney while the audience is on the upper levels, is grandly resonant and the evening’s finest single feature.They and conductor Eotvos are equally memorable in Bartok’s masterpiece, where Adrienn Miksch’s Judith confronts Balint Szabo’s Bluebeard with her unwelcome demands for him to reveal the secrets hidden behind his seven mysterious doors.Once again, this is a penny-plain staging, with projections, apparitions and lighting effects providing what atmosphere a show designed for international touring can summon up. Though the opera is sung in the original Hungarian, actor Philippe Murgier presents the spoken prologue in French – presumably because the production began life in France."

Martin Lloyd-Evans’ traditional staging provides entertainment and as much narrative clarity as is feasible given the highly condensed nature of the piece. Benjamin Britten apparently considered making an opera out of the book, but one can see why he dropped the idea.As usual Dove turns in a score that presents listeners with no rebarbative difficulties. The problem, rather, is that his music is so swamped by the impacts of minimalism and Stephen Sondheim that it retains little character of its own.Skilfully written from all points of view, this operatic costume drama offers little depth and less edge; but it is very amiably done in this archetypal country-house setting close to where Austen herself once lived.The 10-strong ensemble cast work hard at their roles and with some success, even if the central figure of Fanny Price remains – as many Austen fans have felt – too passive to register as anything more than a wet blanket.Though mezzo Martha Jones does everything possible to give her a more sympathetic reading, she is inevitably upstaged by the soprano glamour of Shelley Jackson’s Mary Crawford. Personality oozes from Sarah Pring’s Lady Bertram and Jeni Bern’s Mrs Norris, while the other roles are all solidly sung.The experienced David Parry is in musical charge, drawing a thoroughly accomplished performance from the principals and the 13-piece orchestra."

The six-strong young cast has an infectious sense of fun.Wisely, spoken dialogue is entirely omitted and Valentina Ceschi’s production zips along. Mozart’s sublime score is essentially intact and treated with due respect.The show is double-cast; here, Peter Kirk’s Tamino has boyish charm, Tom Stoddart is a likeable party-geezer Papageno (“I’m cool and I’m great company / I’m sure you all know guys like me”) whose ringtone replaces the traditional pan-pipes. Luci Briginshaw’s Queen of the Night has all the high notes, and Abigail Kelly’s Pamina is more feisty than most.But as impressive as the cast is, star of the show is guitarist Alex Menaker, standout of the tight four-piece band. His virtuosic dexterity, especially in the overture and Queen of the Night’s showcase aria, is thrilling. Who’d have thought it would sound so natural to hear Mozart played brilliantly on electric fuzz-guitar? It’s utterly joyous, worth going to see this production for alone."

Having paved the way for Mozart, whom he admired and encouraged, he became known as the man who killed the young genius. Salieri’s reputation for attractive, well-crafted music was swept away by the falsehood.Bampton Classical Opera’s sprightly performance, the first in London since 1786, of The School of Jealousy, showed the debt Mozart owed his mentor. Mozart’s Così fan Tutte was the sequel to this story of straying wives and jealous husbands.Salieri’s opera is full of barbed humour, comic confusion and cod psychology. The music, lightly scored for strings, oboes, horns and bassoons, bowls along under the direction of Anthony Kraus, conducting CHROMA for the this London performance.On the tiny stage of St John’s the orchestra is hidden behind the simple set and communication between singers and conductor is remarkable considering the obstacles.Director Jeremy Gray captures the fun and silliness of opera buffa, encouraging his young cast to ham it up in a translation that included digs at Trump, Brexit and the Mexican wall. There are inspired comic performances from Samuel Pantcheff as Lumaca, the lanky servant with a beguiling baritone and Alessandro Fisher singing the blustering Count Bandiera, while Matthew Sprange makes a sympathetic figure out of the bumbling merchant Blasio.The women are by turns graceful and venomous: Rhiannon Llewellyn, in the role written for star soprano Nancy Storace, veer between lustrous high phrases and spitting rage, mezzo Kate Howden was a cheerful insolent maid and Nathalie Chalkley a flirtatious but faithful wife. Thomas Herford, refined and elegant as the Lieutenant, enjoys the chaos his meddling had produced.It’s clear to see why The School of Jealousy was the most popular opera in its day. "

The first night was dedicated to the memory of Lee Blakeley – in his own right an accomplished director, who first worked for the company assisting McVicar on this show when it was new in 2003, and who died suddenly last month aged just 45.John Macfarlane’s complex sets – and how smoothly and quickly they are reconfigured by the stage crew, without any pauses between the opera’s innumerable scenes – still look architecturally grand and, where required, magical; and what makes McVicar’s presentation of the piece so satisfying is that he finds room not only for the work’s philosophical leanings (which, quite rightly, he does not regard uncritically), but equally for its low-comedy, its pantomime hocus-pocus and its wider sense of a spiritual journey. The result remains a remarkably complete staging of a piece of extraordinary dramatic diversity.This is a solid cast, too, with several standouts. Among notable company debuts are Finnish bass Mika Kares’s richly resonant Sarastro, Swiss tenor Mauro Peter’s appealingly lyrical Tamino and French soprano Sabine Devieilhe’s pinpoint accurate Queen of the Night.Roderick Williams’s Papageno is a joy, and delivered with a Lieder-singer’s subtle inflections as well as masterly comic skills. Australian soprano Siobhan Stagg offers an attractively sung Pamina, while Peter Bronder’s vile Monostatos and Austrian soprano Christina Gansch’s Coronation-Street-diva of a Papagena would be hard to better. Among the smaller roles, there’s a particularly fine trio of boys.Currently based in Germany, British conductor Julia Jones returns to the pit where she maintains perfect dramatic momentum, and the whole evening goes with a swing."

John Copley’s old staging had exceptional staying power, and though some might think that it should have been replaced long ago, the deed has finally been done.Director Richard Jones has already given the company many successes, and if Puccini’s sentimental (in the best sense) tale of love and death might not seem his natural territory, the show still has a good deal to recommend it. La Boheme contains comedy, too, as well as painfully realistic emotional tensions, and this new version emphasises these aspects without relinquishing a focus on its bittersweet romantic centre.In some respects this is a traditional realisation, set in 19th-century Paris – some decades later, though, than the original’s ‘around 1830’. The attic in which the four young male artists work, starve and fool around, and the wintry environs of a sleazy bar at the gates of Paris, are both sparsely represented in Stewart Laing’s sets; but the stops are pulled out for a luxurious Cafe Momus surrounded by grander vistas of the city and where Simona Mihai’s outrageously flamboyant Musetta triumphantly steals the scene.She’s brilliantly partnered by Marius Kwiecien’s forthright yet complex Marcello, while Nicole Car’s unusually strong-willed Mimi shows the young Australian soprano to have real star potential.Michael Fabiano’s Rodolfo is less vocally charismatic – his tenor doesn’t quite blossom at the top as it should – but there are many rewarding details in his performance, as there are in those of his skilfully individualised flatmates, Florian Sempey’s jocular Schaunard and Luca Tittoto’s more earnest Colline.Meanwhile, and with a little help from the orchestra and chorus, Antonio Pappano, the finest Puccini conductor of the day, ensures that the score comes over with exceptional vividness."

James Hurley cunningly located his production for British Youth Opera in a soulless modernist hotel, some time in the 1970s.There are moments of sleazy period glamour, but violence is never far away. Hurley traps the characters in the hotel foyer, the basement car park and Giovanni’s suite before dumping them in a chiaroscuro urban wasteland for the tricky sequence that opens Act II.The action is smartly and coherently organised and the requisite laughs are generated by the charcoal-toned Leporello of Michael Mofidian, stealing scenes with his edgy comedy. He, like the entire cast, deliver the partially updated rhyming translation with crisp clarity (there are no surtitles).In the title role, Jake Muffett is less angular – suave, soft-grained and charming, but a ruthless bastard. He is pursued by Samantha Clarke as the highly-strung Donna Elvira, singing with luminous, lyrical vibrancy, and Charlie Drummond as Donna Anna, spinning a steely, but lithe vocal line and properly traumatised by the murder of her father, the Commendatore.Making ghostly appearances at some unexpected moments, he is intoned with magnificent sonorous warmth by Christian Valle. There is a gentle, but unfailingly firm heroism in the Don Ottavio of Adam Temple-Smith, while Lauren Joyanne Morris made a spring-fresh, but provocatively knowing Zerlina and Felix Kemp an unusually classy Masetto, phrased with elegance.If Lionel Friend’s conducting tends to the measured rather than the mercurial, he always gives his highly accomplished young singers the space to take full command of their roles."

Her own libretto weaves together three ancient Scottish tales, each of them featuring a bridegroom who vanishes — though none of the characters has an actual name.Played consecutively, the tales are linked. In the first a couple who marry following the disappearance of an earlier suitor become in the second the parents of a daughter; it is on his way to fetch a priest for her christening that the husband is lured away into a fairy-hill. Grown to a young woman in the third tale, the daughter herself is wooed by a stranger who turns out to be the devil – and eventually emulates his predecessors by vanishing.The best aspects of Weir’s score – carefully performed here by Southbank Sinfonia under James Holmes, but in a reduced orchestration by Michael Lee – are those showing the direct influence of folk culture, including Gaelic psalm-singing and so-called ‘waulking songs’ from the Western Isles. Elsewhere the writing feels grey and anonymous, and overall Weir does not quite hit the operatic nail on the head as she did in her earlier A Night at the Chinese Opera – a genuine modern classic.But the piece does provide the material for a substantial company of young professional singers and chorus to get its teeth into – all of the company members engaging confidently in Stuart Barker’s production, which conveys visually the distinctive national and period feel of the original stories.There’s nevertheless a worrying impression that this valuable company – which helps give experience and exposure to so many young artists – is not currently attracting the funding it deserves."

Musical values are consistently high.The original was set in 16th-century Portugal, and deals with political and amorous complications centring on the young king (a trouser role, handled with suavity by Emily Kyte), his winsome queen (prettily sung and ably acted by Charlotte Knight) and the writer Cervantes – who somehow gets in on the act and is delivered with conspicuous matinee idol ebullience by William Morgan.Clarke transfers the visuals to 19th-century Vienna, where Wanda D’Onofrio’s lavish costumes look splendid but the plot remains intractable and the show a little too long.Yet it is remarkable how well the company do by a pretty thin piece, especially in some of the better numbers and clever comic routines that come along after the interval.It is impossible not to warm to the savoir faire of Charles Johnston’s preposterous Prime Minister, Katharine Taylor-Jones’ glamorously knowing Marchioness and Nicholas Ransley’s expertly sung Don Sancho. The fact is that Clarke and his company know exactly what to do with these pieces, and by the end you’re cheering them on."

Sassu makes a consistently convincing Mimi, torn in her affections and fading with a rare and poignant dignity.In a production which always works but does not always shine, Olle provides plenty of details around the stage. Mimi’s stairwell encounter with Benoit pegs him as a bona-fide sleaze ball, for example. While the whole of Act II is a triumph of storytelling, first in an illicit flea-market and then as Kelebogile Besong’s strutting Musetta dominates the ultra-trendy Caffe Momus, seen side-on, with its androgynous waiting staff.The problem is that there is too much detail for this size of stage and some of the crucial elements which define Act III – set in a red-light district – are not visible from much of the Festival Theatre’s auditorium.It’s a production which wears its 21st century setting reasonably lightly, with Rodolfo’s pen a malfunctioning laptop and the “milkmaids” waiting to get past the guards in Act III a group of sex workers. But by being this exact, the discrepancy between modern medicine and Mimi’s illness simply jars."

It’s a fever-dream of a show about a family of hillbilly grifters – named Fodder, Dodder and Brodder –who scrape a living by conning people hoping for a sighting of the mythical Sasquatch. Then daughter, Dodder, a paperclip-limbed junkie fed on meth and mayonnaise by her father and kept on a leash, meets the real Bigfoot and she falls in love with him.Sasquatch: The Opera is a warped, opioid love story, a monumentally strange interspecies take on Romeo and Juliet in which addiction – and withdrawal – feature prominently.Designer Michael Hill has strewn the stage with leaves and little molehills of hair. It looks like the room has been infested by Tribbles. The production as a whole is large-scale for a fringe show, boasting a six-strong chorus dressed as meth cooks, along with six musicians, including Bottum on synth.Ahmed Ibrahim’s production is strong on atmospherics but the scene-to-scene transitions are so awkward and abrupt that the momentum suffers. The performers frequently scuttle off stage. There are however some thunderous vocal performances, particularly from tenor Alex Frankel and bass-baritone Joe Chappel.There are moments here that feel like a heady mash-up of Tod Browning and David Lynch, and other moments that are just laughably daft. Narrative clarity is not a strong point, but with its scenes of people tweaking in forest glades and communing with the moon, this make for a spectacularly bizarre, occasionally impenetrable but nonetheless hypnotic experience, a throbbing psychotropic oddity."

Hers is a voice you would not cross swords with, and her appearance on horseback to take Dalibor Jenis’ in-thrall Macbeth from his second encounter with the witches simply reinforces her status.It is even better endowed on the production front, with an onstage cast including choruses of actors and dancers as well as singers. Rather than numbering just three, the witches are represented by a multitude of hair-tossing women, bored while they are impregnated by a gang of satyrs in the opening scene. They are equally disdainful in Act III as they birth their babies direct into cauldrons so they might turn into more sorcerers.This reinforces the contrast between the witches’ fertility and Lady Macbeth’s barrenness. The former’s disdain juxtaposed with the Macbeths’ lust to direct the future is the production’s driving motif.Scotland this is not, however. Birnam Wood is a cactus grove of prickly pears and there is a sumptuous, magical-realism feel to Carmine Maringola’s design, which features a glittering, spear-like motif that serves to draw war, religion and state together.Dante has created opera as big spectacle, which feels designed for an arena setting. Seen in closer view, however, all that burnished opulence loses some of its lustre. Its strokes are bold and broad, but its details are not punctilious."

The writer was the avant-garde Berlin artist Kurt Schwitters, best known for his mixed-media collages. Production difficulties and the collapsing German economy nipped the original project in the bud, and any score produced at the time has disappeared without trace.Though described as a ‘cabaret opera’, Coenen-Rowe’s Collision does not offer show tunes or pastiche. The through-composed score does, however, evoke the music of the Weimar Republic – both jazzily popular and rigorously serious. It is inventive, coherent, and often quite tough as it strains at the limits of tonality. Directed by Sean Morris, the band comprises five players – piano, violin, cello, clarinet and saxophone – who also moonlight on small percussion instruments, notably at the brilliantly bathetic moment when the predicted collision between the Earth and a rogue planet simply doesn’t happen.A motley crew of characters career around Berlin after an astronomer discovers the formula for global catastrophe. The six singers are highly proficient, and director Cecilia Stinton keeps things cracking along, but, in the unforgiving intimacy of the Arcola’s Studio 2, the whole thing needs more stylised edge and is 15 minutes too long. It would be good to see and hear it in a larger space but, until then, at least it’s not the end of the world."

First up is Simone Spagnolo’s Even You, Lights, Cannot Hear Me, the shorter piece at half an hour in length.It derives from a monologue in Chekhov’s The Seagull, newly translated by Dimitry Devdariani. As the programme note puts it – not quite avoiding pretension in doing so – “two singers, depicted as two beings embodied into one entity, wander a surreal, yet exquisite cosmos, in which nothingness and wholeness co-exist, timelessly”.The singers – mezzo-soprano Kate Symonds-Joy and baritone James Schouten – are seated back to back, forming the single entity referred to in the notes. Schouten is initially turned towards the piano, which he plays as he sings the often enigmatic text. Facing the audience, meanwhile, is mezzo Symonds-Joy, mouthing the words he sings. As she does so, she picks up pebbles, then drops them in time with the music. Later, the two performers’ positions switch round.There’s a mildly spiritual quality to the result, even if it frequently feels – perhaps deliberately – intangible and indefinite.Sarah Toth’s Nero Monologues also has a literary background – in this case, texts from Geoffrey Lehmann’s Nero’s Poems, translations of the public and private poems of the Emperor Nero. These form the basis for an over-extended piece in which Toth’s Nero lives out his final hours in the company of dancer Louis Ducasse, who for some reason wears a balaclava helmet over his face.Toth’s dramatic instincts and genuine vocal talent are fatally compromised by weak diction: not nearly enough of the text comes over. But the piece is founded on a viable idea, and its effective scoring for piano and string quartet is skilfully realised."

While Edinburgh celebrates internationalism and a world which forged peace out of discord, this England is a land floundering, unbidden, into the quagmire of a modern take on the myth of Oedipus. And in the Oedipal figure, Eddy, Alex Otterburn portrays a man wilfully going to his own destruction and dragging with him all those around him.Joe Hill-Gibbins’ production for Opera Ventures and Scottish Opera is bold and tacky. Alex Lowde’s costumes are PVC fetish-wear; the four singers descend into the pit at times, to manipulate images which are projected up on to the revolving backdrop. Otterburn sprinkles maggots, which wriggle and squirm in bold and gaudy Technicolor. They are replaced by pages from contemporary newspapers with headlines of bloody revenge and pictures of naked flesh.The four-strong company delivers Turnage’s strident music with all the force it deserves, bringing out the comic and finding the violence. Susan Bullock’s Mother and Andrew Shore’s Father are hand-wringing in their revelations, Allison Cook as Eddy’s wife is an avaricious widow, determined to replace her husband.It takes place on a thin strip of stage, in front of the white revolve with an open doorway at either end. On turning, it extends out over the pit, threatening to sweep the singers off the stage. Greek had its UK premiere at the EIF in 1988, towards the end of the Thatcher era. Three decades later, it feels more relevant than ever."

It’s a Middle Eastern cultural touchstone and the name of zesty new opera receiving its UK premiere at Lewis Cubitt Square in King’s Cross.The protaganist, Andreas, sings ecstatically of the delight of eating lots and lots of hummus. He shares the stage with a six-person vocal ensemble that is equally hummus obsessed. But the ensemble has some serious questions for him: what exactly did Andreas see when he was in that unnamed, beautiful country? What did he experience? He ignores the questions.As the ensemble’s questioning becomes ever more urgent, Andreas’s hummus mania gives way to memories of witnessing a massacre. Can Andreas fully open the door to his dark recollections?Composer/librettist Zad Moultaka drew on his own experiences in the Lebanese civil war for this brief but evocative opera. His a capella score mixes elements of Arabic folk music with contemporary classical styles.Nicholas Morris, in the physically challenging central role, moves easily from a dance of uninhibited gluttony to paroxyms of deep anguish. Morris, making the most of his versatile voice, and the ensemble, conducted by Clara Coelho, grapple with the vocal demands of Moultaka’s score and his tongue-twisting libretto, sung in German.Max Hoehn, recipient of the 2015 Independent Opera director award, directed the premiere of the work with Opera Lab Europe in Lisbon, and restages it effectively here on an unadorned stage.Téte a Téte artistic director Bill Bankes-Jones deserves a large bowl of the best hummus for bringing this opera and others to the Cubitt Sessions, which continue through August 13. "

But for a brief moment in China’s history, one man succeeded in realising his vision of utopia, a blend of Confucianism and constitutional monarchy.Kang Youwei was the trailblazing political reformer who persuaded the Emperor to launch the Hundred Days’ Reform. His vision of Chinese democracy was, however, dashed by a vicious coup d’etat organised by the imperial concubine, Empress Dowager Cixi.Writer and filmmaker Evans Chan has turned this little-known story into an award-winning film and a chamber opera, Datong: The Chinese Utopia, which had its UK premiere during London’s Hong Kong Music Series.Eclectic and at time brilliant music by Chan Hing-Yan, referencing styles from Alban Berg to Chinese folk song and the Beatles and played by an ensemble that included Chinese traditional instruments, ensured that the story came alive in spite of the slightly didactic text.Director Tang Shu-Wing created cinematic pictures with simple sets and projections: Act I was set on a cruise liner; Act II in the book-lined lobby of the US Department of State where Kang Youwei and his daughter Tongbi ask President Roosevelt to stop discriminating against Chinese workers and Act III a garret where Tongbi and her daughter were hiding from the zealots of the Cultural Revolution. Costumes were spectacular, especially the rich robes of the Emperor and the Dowager Cixi.It was uniformly well-sung and acted by a small chorus and soloists with Hong Kong connections– special mention goes to indefatigable soprano Louise Kwong in the demanding role of Tongbi, but the other three soloists, bass Apollo Wong (Kang Youwei), mezzo-soprano Carol, Lin (Empress/ granddaughter) and tenor David Quah (missionary/ Roosevelt) created equally vivid characters. A potentially dry slice of China’s history was transformed into an operatic event by skilful direction and a scintillating score. "

Richard Studer’s circle-within-a square portal design proves a serviceable blank slate for the committed young cast. But the director, and choreographer Mark Smith, do them no favours with Bollywood-inspired gestures and a lyre strings/heartstrings ribbon motif which lend awkward rigidity rather than dramatic flow to the intended ritualism.The 12-strong chorus nonetheless sing with spirit and, supported by an excellent baroque band, exuding energy and focus under conductor Jeremy Silver, mezzo Hanna-Liisa Kirchin creates a poignant Orpheus within the formalised frame. Vocally and dramatically the highlight of the evening is her duet with soprano Nazan Fikret’s insightfully portrayed, angrily perplexed Euridice; at which point – perhaps ironically – the drama is pared down to emotional essentials more instinctively conveyed.Soprano He Wu makes what she can of the somewhat hapless Amore, intercessor between wilful humans and capricious gods.Ultimately – in Jagusz’s production as in Gluck’s version of the myth – music conquers all to provide a happy, if not wholly satisfying, ending. "

They sing, dance and make music alongside the Garsington Opera Orchestra and a strong team of principals, all conducted by the event’s artistic director, Douglas Boyd.There is a real sense of vision in this coming together, as clear in the unstoppable energy of the performers as it is in the excellence of the stagecraft displayed in Karen Gillingham’s complex production.The subject chosen for this new work is war; specifically the impact of war upon an individual soldier and his family. Jessica Duchen’s libretto has been partly inspired by the experiences of former Irish Guard lance corporal Jay Wheeler, who was present at the performance, as were members of the family of First World War poet Siegfried Sassoon, whose life and work have also fed into the piece.The narrative describes how brothers Jack and Davey, from an ordinary working-class family, both join the army and serve in some unspecified modern theatre of war, where Jack saves his younger brother’s life. Yet the soldier’s harrowing experiences eventually impact not only on Jack but also on his entire family.Duchen has written an eminently singable text that Panufnik sets to music. The company clearly relishes performing it. Boyd energises the whole evening with his committed conducting.But the lasting impression will be of the vast cast, engaged – almost all of them for the first time – on an opera designed for them and to whose challenges they rise with focused enthusiasm."

A married, middle-aged woman visiting her mother in hospital strikes up a relationship with a pathologist, in which their childhoods as well as their sexuality are mutually explored. The work is deftly scored for five cellos – raised on platforms and semi-covered in sheets, as if awaiting their own post-mortems. Actor Alessandra Faiello and soprano Laura Catrani produce hauntingly atmospheric performances, accompanied by ravishing cello playing, sensitively and alertly conducted by Pilar Bravo.The final performance was the least operatic, a monologue – more a 50-minute tour de force – in which Abigail McGibbon plays out 15 episodes in the life of Catherine of Aragon. The music, featuring a small piano-based ensemble, rarely does more than underpin the drama, but does so successfully, beginning with pointillist economy but later drawing on high-class Classical-period pastiche and full-blooded Romantic sweep. The music may take a back seat, but McGibbon’s myriad shifts of mood and pacing is spellbinding."

The Bastille had been stormed two years earlier, while Marie-Antoinette – sister of the new Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II, for whose coronation as King of Bohemia it was commissioned – was deposed as Queen of France just two days before the work’s Prague premiere. Mozart’s task was to provide an endorsement of enlightened monarchism when it seemed to be on the slide, his opera’s hero an ideal ruler, repeatedly forgiving those closest to him when they attempt to overthrow him.And indeed it is a measure both of the strength of the piece and of the deep insights of Guth’s production — which uses videos to present Tito and Sesto’s close relationship as children — that one firmly believes in the Emperor’s dilemma.This is also an evening of magnificently dramatic singing from Alice Coote’s twice-rejected Vitellia, Anna Stephany’s conflicted Sesto, Richard Croft’s tortured Tito, Clive Bayley’s civil-servant-like Publio, Michele Losier’s unquestioning Annio and Joelle Harvey’s honest Servilia.Strength and skill, too, from the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment as they demonstrate the opera’s musical greatness under the vital baton of Robin Ticciati – a welcome returnee to the Glyndebourne pit following his indisposition last season."

Amelia, a young lawyer, is married to aspiring West End composer, Stephen. When it comes to TV, she’s glued to callipygian Kim Kardashian, but he prefers a Mozart opera. Three strands of action intertwine: Amelia and Stephen; Kim and her husband of 72 days, basketball player Kris Humphries, and Count and Countess Almaviva from Mozart’s Le Nozze di Figaro. It’s a lot for a 75-minute show.Initially, the latter couple sing excerpts from Figaro in Italian, but soon switch to new English words in famous arias not necessarily assigned them by Mozart. It’s all fairly clever, and the eclectic, pop-infused music for the modern couples – with its tight strings, percussion and electronic keyboard – is fluent and occasionally ingenious, but it favours timid motifs rather than big melodies, or even big rhythms. Inevitably, it gets outshone by Wolfgang Amadeus.The lyrics are more gently amusing than laugh-out-loud, and the half-rhymes tend to sound defeatist (though “Puccini on/Armenian” was rather good). The mood-shift towards the end – to serious stuff about relationships – seemed shoehorned in too.All six performers shape their characters adeptly (with James Edge’s Kris somehow simultaneously slimy and engaging) and there is some strong singing, though the amplification is inconsistent and too many words get lost. Even if The Marriage of Kim K seems unlikely to break the internet, its creative team shows promise. "

Perhaps the play’s focus on Shylock, the scorned outsider, resonated with Tchaikowsky, who as a child survived the Warsaw ghetto thanks to his exceptionally determined grandmother.After the war, she propelled him into an international career as a concert pianist and composer. In 1981, a year before his early death, he took The Merchant of Venice, his only opera, to the English National Opera. They weren’t interested, and the opera didn’t receive its world premiere until 2013, with the Welsh National Opera giving the first UK performance in Cardiff in 2016.Most of Cardiff cast reprise their roles in this London premiere. African-American baritone Lester Lynch richly deserves praise for transcending caricature with pathos and power, both vocally and dramatically, in the pivotal role of Shylock.Tchaikowsky’s music is solidly mid-20th century, with traces of Stravinsky, Prokofiev and Britten, and it’s incisively played by the WNO orchestra under Lionel Friend. There’s an sharp shift from the twittery, nervous music of the first two acts to a greater lyricism in the third act, when eloquent arias roll in one after another. This opportunity is effectively embraced by, among others, Sarah Castle as Portia and Mark Le Brocq as Bassanio, with a commendable effort by Martin Wolfel as Antonio, but his countertenor has trouble projecting over the large orchestra, a misjudgement to be blamed on the composer.Visually, designer Ashley Martin-Davis makes a sharp contrast between the dark soul-less business world of Venice and the playful, soft world of Belmont. The costumes harken back to early 1900s, bringing to mind Britten’s Death in Venice, though this period nostalgia is disrupted by Nazis and a top hat-wearing Marlene Dietrich character."
133,Zaza review at Opera Holland Park – ‘a richly detailed production’,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2017/zaza-review-opera-holland-park/,Zaza,Opera Holland Park – ‘a richly detailed production’,Zaza review at Opera Holland Park,4,2017-07-19,George Hall,"Over the years Opera Holland Park has made a speciality of the operas of Puccini and his contemporaries – a group often referred to as the verismo (or realist) school.This year’s choice falls on the neglected Zaza, written in 1900 by Ruggero Leoncavallo. Though universally known for his violent thriller Pagliacci, as Holland Park demonstrates, he was more than just a one-hit wonder.A music hall artiste in 1890s France, Zaza has an affair with Dufresne, a businessman who lies to her about his marital status; she discovers the truth by visiting his home while he is away and encountering his wife and daughter. In the no-holds-barred emotionalism of the final scene she sends him on his way.The opera’s social viewpoint – that of the ‘other woman’, and one coping with an alcoholic mother – must have seemed shocking in its day and still packs a powerful punch when delivered, as here, with complete conviction. The world of the French music-hall was one Leoncavallo knew intimately from his own period as a struggling composer in 1880s Paris, and he sketches it with constant vitality and humour.His attractive musical depiction is nicely matched by Alyson Cummins’ complex backstage set and Camille Assaf’s witty theatrical costumes, and indeed throughout Marie Lambert’s richly detailed production, which is strong on both character and narrative.Leading the cast, Holland Park regular Anne Sophie Duprels once again hurls herself into the title role with significant flair and definite savoir-faire. She’s expertly partnered by Joel Montero as her lying lover Dufresne, with immaculate support from Richard Burkhard as her staunch colleague Cascart and Louise Winter as her drunken, happy-go-lucky mother.The City of London Sinfonia’s authoritative playing of Leoncavallo’s appealing and impassioned score under Peter Robinson’s vital baton sets the seal on this worthwhile re-launch."
134,"Katya Kabanova review at Opera Holland Park, London – ‘incisive eloquence’",https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2017/katya-kabanova-opera-holland-park-london/,Katya Kabanova,Opera Holland Park,London,4,2017-07-17,George Hall,"Opera Holland Park rarely brings a production back, but this show from 2009 proves well worth reviving. Janacek’s 1921 Katya Kabanova is an outstanding example of his work – highly original and musically punchy, yet also lyrical and emotionally direct.Making her company debut in the pit, conductor Sian Edwards understands its complex style perfectly, and she and the City of London Sinfonia convey the score’s atmospheric power with incisive eloquence.Based on a mid-19th-century play, Katya takes place in a provincial Russian town in the 1860s. Fuchs and her designer Yannis Thavoris move it forward, without any loss, to Janacek’s own time, with the costumes particularly redolent of that period.The stage pictures show us the Volga and the circumscribed, prison-like emotional world of Julia Sporsen’s desperately vulnerable Katya, locked into a loveless marriage with cowardly drunk Tichon – superbly played by Nicky Spence – and mercilessly bullied by Anne Mason’s vindictive Kabanicha – opera’s mother-in-law from hell.Peter Hoare’s considered performance as Katya’s feckless, ‘here today, gone tomorrow’ lover Boris completes the central quartet – but there are further skilled and equally finely sung assumptions from Clare Presland as the foundling girl Varvara, Paul Curievici as the schoolteacher Kudrjas, and Mikhail Svetlov as the masochistic merchant Dikoj. Taken altogether, this is an exemplary cast.The opera also provides another great night for the company’s chorus, trained by Paul Wingfield, which enters fully into the spirit of the show, adopting some complex, quasi-expressionist movement with conviction.With a substantially Anglophone cast, there is a strong case for performing Janacek’s Czech operas in English, which might have made this Katya even more involving. But the combination of Fuchs’ intelligent direction and the exceptional team who bring the piece alive already achieve something special."
135,Don Pasquale review at Glyndebourne – ‘an evening of brilliant entertainment’,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2017/don-pasquale-review-glyndebourne/,Don Pasquale,Glyndebourne – ‘an evening of brilliant entertainment’,Don Pasquale review at Glyndebourne,4,2017-07-14,George Hall,"First seen in 2011, Mariame Clement’s production of Donizetti’s classic comedy about an elderly man who marries a young woman with disastrous consequences springs a few surprises on those who know the piece well. Unusually, she and designer Julia Hansen turn the clock back, setting a work the composer expected to be played in its own time (1843) in the eighteenth century – though the results are admittedly very handsome.More controversial is the implied sexual relationship between Norina and Doctor Malatesta, though again it’s an idea which, however naughty, works well, adding to the piece’s emotional complexity; so do the small hints that Ernesto just could be Pasquale’s son rather than his nephew.As a staging, the result is a clever and regularly subtle piece of work, avoiding any suggestion of tomfoolery and instead concentrating on the exploration of the complexity of characters often seen as stock types. It even manages – perhaps uniquely in this piece – a momentary coup de theatre with its flamboyant use of costuming for the chorus as the revolve takes the audience on a tour of Pasquale’s house that turns out to be full of visual surprises.The cast is not quite as choice as some previous ones in this production, but it’s still very good. Renato Girolami has a fine basis for Pasquale, a star role he will undoubtedly take further. Lisette Oropesa’s Norina is vocally adept, and Andrew Stenson’s Ernesto innocently charming. The finest principal performance comes from Andrey Zhilikhovsky as Malatesta – a suave, strongly sung account of the arch-manipulator.Conductor Giacomo Sagripanti draws precise and dainty playing from the London Philharmonic Orchestra, allowing the score to bounce buoyantly along."

She swings from anguish to ecstasy when that lover finally phones, but as we listen to Elle’s side of the conversation, we realise the relationship has reached the end of the line.Written in 1958 and based on Jean Cocteau’s 1928 play, La Voix Humaine asks the solo soprano to ride a roller coaster of emotions in just 50 minutes. In this new production by OperaUpClose, Sarah Minns, in shimmery silk pyjamas, convincingly portrays Elle’s rapidly changing moods – self-delusion, panic, sentimentality and desperation – with a slightly breathy soprano and impressive acting ability.The phone that Minns clings to throughout is an iconic 1930s black Bakelite model with an exceedingly long cord, and it’s almost a character on its own right. The same could be said of Poulenc’s Romantic-tinged music, well played here by pianist Richard Black. Minns sings in English, using a careful translation by Joseph Machlis that retains the mood of the original French.Minns and her phone wander around a set that features grid-work panels, possibly meant to suggest her mental imprisonment. But they are rather distracting, especially given the audience’s close proximity to the stage in Kings Place Hall Two.It’s amusing to consider that for some audience members, certain plot conceits of this opera – the call being disrupted by a woman on a party line, for instance – would be unfamiliar, unlike the sound of a mobile phone ringing, which did happen on press night during a tender moment.The production bodes well for OperaUpClose’s return to the London opera firmament after a two-year hiatus."

It’s also easily amongst the best of his early operas, with some definite pre-echoes of his first accepted masterpiece, Idomeneo, written nine years later.Its subject is the ancient general and dictator Lucius Sulla (sic), who ruled Rome around 80BC but eventually – so history records – retreated to the country with his wife and his boyfriend. In Mozart’s opera, there is no wife and no boyfriend, while both politically and personally Silla the ruler is a villain and a bully until a sudden late change of heart causes him to pardon his enemies and allow them to marry whomsoever they please; one might think this a rather fanciful view of how dictators behave, but the librettist’s intention was presumably to set-up an ideal for contemporary leaders to follow.At any rate, Harry Silverstein’s modern-dress production, with its low-key but serviceable designs by Linda Buchanan, gives credibility to the characters and their situations, however high-flown, while the general standard of singing in an opera that demands virtuosity from all its principals is never less than honourable and regularly more.Joshua Ellicott succeeds in giving Silla an angry and unstable persona, as he victimises Rebecca Bottone’s often frantic Giunia, Madeleine Pierard’s fearless Cecilio, Fflur Wyn’s cleanly articulated Celia and Karolina Plickova’s bold Cinna; as Silla’s loyal henchman Aufidio, Ben Thapa clearly has his doubts about his boss’s policies, but goes along with them anyway.A major asset is the stylish and sharply defined playing of The English Concert in the pit, while conductor Laurence Cummings superintends a performance with plenty of musical and dramatic clout."

Whether Britten’s tame social satire can bear repeated viewing, however good the performances it receives, is another matter.Matthews, however, makes one unusual decision which is on the one hand brave though in practical terms dubious. Many commentators see in the piece a clear gay subtext, in which Albert’s escape from the village’s moral strictures represents a kind of coming-out. Matthews at least partially realises this with a new, silent character – The Stranger – played by Simeon John-Wake, who literally dances into Albert’s life and encourages him to explore something unspecific but certainly sexual; unfortunately it doesn’t really work.But almost everything else does, with particularly impressive standouts from Morgan Pearse’s Sid and Lucy Schaufer’s Florence Pike, and with conductor Justin Doyle leading the NCO Festival Orchestra in a spot-on account of the score."

Moldovan bass Oleg Tsibulko gives a dignified account of Banquo and Korean tenor Jung Soo Yun brings lyrical eloquence to the aria Macduff sings in mourning for his murdered wife and children.Unfortunately the show itself is visually undistinguished, with particularly drab costumes, and in terms of action and interaction there’s just not enough conviction.That said, the Buxton International Festival Chorus and NCO festival Orchestra offer energy if less than ideal sharpness of ensemble under Stephen Barlow’s baton."

Antonenko is a limited actor, though, and neither he nor Goerke makes much of the text: her words, in particular, rarely cut through.As is often the case, it is the production’s Liu – Russian lyric soprano Hibla Gerzmava – who leaves the more positive impression, though Korean bass In Sung Sim is an underwhelming Timur.Plenty of life, though, from the trio of masks – Michel de Souza’s Ping, Aled Hall’s Pang, and Pavel Petrov’s Pong – even if none of them stands out individually.The chorus have a vital role to play in this opera and they are all present and correct under chorus director William Spaulding’s tutelage. The orchestra, too, shines in the detail of Puccini’s glittering score, which Israeli conductor Dan Ettinger conveys with definition and purpose."

English National Opera is not really in the concert-hall business, and the staging of oratorios, though more frequently attempted these days, can be a hazardous enterprise.Yet this concert hall staging by Lucy Carter, which involves no movement and relies on lighting alone, proves to be a powerful and imaginative realisation of a work with a unique narrative trajectory: surrounded by friends who pray for him, the ailing Gerontius dies, and we witness his journey into the afterlife and the hosts of demons and angels that he encounters before he is led to divine judgment.The text appealed to the Catholic Elgar and inspired from him one of the greatest of all choral works. Musically, this performance under conductor Simone Young captures its intensity, its exaltation and its sense of fear that eventually finds consolation in the moving final section.Patricia Bardon’s inspiring Angel, Matthew Rose’s grandly voiced Priest and Angel of the Agony, and Gwyn Hughes Jones’ committed Gerontius, all leave a strong impression – though diction could sometimes be better.The ENO Chorus combines with the BBC Singers to deliver expert, fine-toned and regularly thrilling singing. The company’s orchestra is on exceptional form, while Young’s interpretation is both fluid and concentrated.But what makes this Gerontius special are visual effects that match Elgar’s score with intelligence and sensitivity, drawing the audience into an unforgettable experience in which music, text and a virtuosic yet regularly restrained use of lighting techniques are aligned in a meaningful unison."

Just three weeks after it moves into a newly built theatre at a new venue, it takes aim at the second segment of Wagner’s Ring – the ultimate challenge in the entire standard repertoire.Jamie Vartan’s designs present images from the period of German nationalism of Wagner’s own day, including a famous painting depicting the first German Emperor, Wilhelm I, at his moment of triumph in 1871 – the year after Die Walkure’s premiere.The first act resembles a small museum – a silent actor (Brian Smith Walters) is even credited in the new role of the Curator – containing exhibits from the natural world as well the few props the act requires, notably the sword Nothung, which Siegmund removes from a glass case rather than heroically drawing it from the canonical tree trunk rising through Hunding’s house. In the final act the magic fire with which Wotan encircles the sleeping Brunnhilde runs around the banister of the balcony above the room that forms the unit set.Despite such striking images, the wholesale focus on one particular historical period limits a piece whose mythical narrative offers far wider and more complex resonances. Often a meticulous and detailed director, here Stephen Medcalf has created something far more generalised, painting Wagner’s in-depth psychology with the broadest of brush strokes.Symptomatically, not enough of the German text comes over, while vocal performances are distinctly variable. Bryan Register’s Siegmund nevertheless suggests considerable potential in the role, while Thomas Hall’s Wotan, if hardly subtle, is grandly voiced. Claire Rutter’s Sieglinde and Alan Ewing’s Hunding are both solidly sung.In the pit, meanwhile, the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra sounds tentative, while Stephen Barlow’s conducting could do with more propulsive energy."

The London Philharmonic Orchestra makes a virtue of this feast of musical styles under their eager young conductor, Cornelius Meister.Katharina Thoma’s 2013 production is distinguished by a lavish set that resembles Glyndebourne’s drawing room in the 1940s. In Act II, the bomb-damaged room has become a hospital ward and Ariadne’s attendants are army nurses who sing like angels.The dramatic logic of Thoma’s production ceases to matter when Ariadne, the Norwegian soprano Lise Davidsen, unveils a soprano of astonishing fullness and beauty. Her voice and character make a colourful contrast with the pert, petite coloratura of Erin Morley as Zerbinetta, who disguises her own heartache with jokey flirtation. In the trouser role of the Composer, Angela Brower gives a tuneful account of a priggish character, the protégé of Thomas Allen’s Music Master.Zerbinetta leads a concert party of blazered men, whose song and dance routines are cleverly choreographed by Lucy Burge. Ariadne’s love interest, Bacchus, (AJ Glueckert) makes a late appearance as Biggles, in unflattering flying suit, but woos Ariadne in a burst of tenor splendour. Their consummation is unintentionally comic, an awkward fumble on a small iron bedstead. Commedia dell’arte triumphs over high art in the end."

The resetting to 1950s Italy allows for a focus on glamour, nostalgia – hence the huge tourist billboard celebrating Naples – and vivid colouring, all of which designer Francis O’Connor exploits to full effect.David Parry, a justly celebrated Rossinian, conducts a performance that is equally colourful and crisply pressed, adding further drama with his continuo playing at the fortepiano.The poet Prosdocimo, a puppeteer in the manner of Mozart’s Don Alfonso from Cosi fan tutte, surveys the results of his social interferences with unalloyed excitement, whether meddling on the ground or observing from his raised study on high.And what a view it is. Sarah Tynan sounds utterly ravishing as Fiorilla. Quirijn de Lang returns as Selim, the Turkish prince, effulgent in tone and chiselled of jaw. They both look gorgeous and their scenes together ingeniously balance comedy, parody and physical desire.As impressive is Geoffrey Dolton’s performance as Fiorilla’s long-suffering husband Genario, a deftly drawn characterisation of the nervous, emasculated ‘straw man’. Not for a second does Dolton come out of role.There’s bright, Italianate singing too from Luciano Botelho’s Narciso and from Jack Swanson in the smaller role of Albazar.As the effects of Prosdocimo’s social engineering ripple out across the stage, there’s another alchemy here – the fusing together of first-rate singing, vivid orchestral playing, pin-sharp comic acting, glamorous design and witty directorial touches too numerous to mention. It’s as close to perfection in a Rossini comedy as you could wish for. A world-class achievement."

It’s representative of the serious opera (‘opera seria’) of the day (1770), when singers (often castratos) ruled the stage and competed throughout the evening to out-sing one another in an endless sequence of ornate and complex solo arias.It’s a kind of musical drama that the adult Mozart would move away from and which eventually fell out of fashion, and it can be a hard sell to modern audiences, requiring extremely careful handling.Fortunately, it gets it here in this revival by Graham Vick of his visually stunning staging, first seen back in 1991. With the striking influence of Baroque and Oriental theatre evident in Paul Brown’s vividly coloured designs, and especially in his enormous and spectacular costumes (which must take a lot of getting used to if you’re wearing them), it provides an evening in which high art meets high camp.Crucial to the show’s success is the quality of the singing, with the individual performers despatching rapid-fire coloratura and impossible high notes as they demonstrate their prodigious virtuosity.No-one disappoints, with exceptional standouts from Michael Spyres as the king of an area now in Turkey who defies Roman rule, and with Bejun Mehta and Salome Jicia as his sons Farnace and Sifare, who – like their father – both want to marry the princess Aspasia, a role in which Albina Shagimuratova gets better and better as the evening proceeds. Lucy Crowe shines equally brightly as Ismene, daughter of a neighbouring king, who eventually marries Farnace.In the pit, historically informed specialist Christophe Rousset makes his Royal Opera debut and never misses a trick."

Madeleine Boyd’s set is dominated by a central generator from which the tubes emerge.The reason (not explicit in the libretto) for Florestan’s wrongful imprisonment by the prison governor Pizarro is crystallised here in a bolted-on flashback scene played out during the overture. Florestan is apprehended while gathering evidence of Pizarro’s dodgy chemical drugs operation.Elizabeth Atherton is a delight to listen to as Fidelio – Florestan’s wife, who has joined the prison as a (male) jailer in order to rescue her husband – combining an assured tone with airy lightness, though between them she and Phelan fail to find the true core of this truly heroic role.Silent until Act II, Adrian Dwyer’s Florestan by contrast can sound a touch strained in his upper register but is dramatically compelling as a prisoner whose deprivation has not robbed him of his benevolence.Some of the most generous singing comes Sam Furness’ Jaquino and Lucy Hall’s Marzelline in the first act. John Paul Huckle as the jailer Rocco can claim cavernous resonance, but it comes at some risk to clarity.French-Israeli conductor Gad Kadosh makes a promising Longborough debut, occasionally dropping momentum but exploring the opera’s darkness with sometimes unsettling depth."

If there are occasional slips into exaggeration, this is perhaps inevitable when Eric Crozier’s libretto, despite moments of sharp wit and lyrical pathos, too often makes flat rhymes and over-emphatic points.In Tim Reed’s designs, atmospheric interiors coexist with Suffolk’s expansive skies and landscape – perhaps symbolising Albert’s potential escape from his suffocating mother. The sturdy doggedness of Richard Pinkstone, firm-voiced in the title role, makes the young grocer more than a wimp, even before he breaks free.In the final scene his rebellious goosing of the imperious Lady Billows – Orla Boylan, vocally imposing and spot-on in her lurching body language – is a joy.The ensemble is uniformly strong, but some rising singers really grab their chances: Kitty Whately and Tim Nelson as the fun-loving and ultimately touching Nancy and Sid; Anna Gillingham as a rapturous Miss Wordsworth; Alexander Robin-Baker, sounding radiant, but leching unctuously as Mr Gedge the vicar, and Emily Vine, captivating as her childish namesake Emmie."

Though he’s perhaps not an ideal exponent of the part, Jonas Kaufmann is an imaginative singer and a highly capable actor. Thought-through and sung with skill, his first Otello is a more than respectable achievement, and one that will surely develop further.Some will be disappointed that the Royal Opera has not yet felt able to cast a black singer in the role – though it’s fair to point out that even singers who specialise in the bigger Verdi repertoire often turn Otello down as unmanageable. There are very few tenors who will attempt it, and vocally Kaufmann is entirely credible in the part.His colleagues are worthwhile, too, with Maria Agresta’s intensely lyrical Desdemona something more: this is quite simply a performance of outstanding vocal beauty and dramatic poise.Marco Vratogna’s Iago is more roughly handled, his interpretation solid though scarcely subtle. Frederic Antoun’s Cassio is delivered with elegance and Thomas Atkins brings Roderigo’s foolishness into sharp focus.

                Where the evening scores most highly is on the musical side, with Antonio Pappano once again showing his impeccable command of Verdian style in a reading with real dramatic sweep. Orchestral playing is strong on detail and flawless in ensemble, while the choral attack under the company’s new chorus director William Spaulding is regularly thrilling."
149,Jenufa review at West Horsley Place – ‘life-affirming’,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2017/jenufa-review-west-horsley-place/,Jenufa,West Horsley Place – ‘life-affirming’,Jenufa review at West Horsley Place,4,2017-06-19,George Hall,"Katie Mitchell’s production of Janacek’s drama of Czech village life was launched by Welsh National Opera in 1998, when the company was performing in Cardiff’s relatively small New Theatre. On its belated transfer to the Grange Park Stage the result looks cramped, while Robin Tebbutt’s revival does not consistently offer the moment-by-moment precision one associates with Mitchell’s best work.That said, the whole show rises to greatness in the searing final act due to exceptional individual performances in the main roles plus a growing sense of overall conviction.There are four fine artists on stage who ensure that it does so. Welsh soprano Natalya Romaniw offers a complete portrayal of Janacek’s heroine, who survives the worst life can throw at her; her intense lyric instrument rises confidently to all demands. As her stepmother the Kostelnicka, Susan Bullock follows the character’s painful journey from a terrible crime to its inevitable punishment, and one feels for her every single step of the way.As the two half-brothers in Jenufa’s life, Nicky Spence perfectly realises the weak, cocksure Steva, whose empty promises lead to disaster — not least for himself: Spence’s tenor gleams brilliantly as he hits his hubristic heights. As the awkward, maybe autistic Laca, Peter Hoare’s fine musicianship and keen acting skills help him create a character for whom one feels compassion, despite his flaws.Secondary roles include strong contributions from Anne-Marie Owens as the concerned family matriarch Grandmother Burya, Harry Thatcher’s interventionist mill foreman, and Jihoon Kim’s out-of-his-depth Mayor.William Lacey’s conducting could do with more punch, and there are moments when the BBC Concert Orchestra and the other forces are out of synch; but the show’s best elements come together to reassert the life-affirming qualities of Janacek’s moving humanistic vision."

Rarely has this extraordinary score revealed such exquisite beauty and yet equally hit home with such devastating power.Following his significant success at Garsington last year with Eugene Onegin, director Michael Boyd demonstrates similar command with Debussy’s symbolist masterpiece. In a work in which many questions are asked but few answered, he preserves the essential mystery of the piece whilst maintaining a clear narrative line.Lit with considerable imaginative skill by Malcolm Rippeth, Tom Piper’s single set is inspired by the decayed magnificence of disused theatres in Detroit, whose distressed grandeur matches the work’s fin de siècle atmosphere perfectly.The central performances are admirable. American soprano Andrea Carroll voices her enigmatic Melisande with gently luminous tone and is sensitively partnered by Jonathan McGovern’s eager, lucidly sung Pelleas – cast here as a baritone: unusually, a tenor is also possible – and some would say preferable – in the role. But together they suggest a relationship where two young people fall in love without either of them realising it.Drawing on the harsher hues of his striking bass-baritone, Paul Gay explores the inner darkness of Pelleas’ jealous half-brother Golaud in a performance whose final stages are painful to witness.Brian Bannatyne-Scott unites dignity and concern as Arkel, while Susan Bickley turns Genevieve’s rare appearances into highlights. Treble William Davies gives a moving account of Golaud’s young son, Yniold – caught up in a complex of relationships he cannot understand – while Dingle Yandell stands out in the small role of the Doctor, making out of it something memorable."

Almost all of the dialogue goes, to be replaced by an English-language narration spoken by actors Aicha Kossoko and Tonderai Munyevu.This might have been a portentous device, but so skilful at explaining the plot is Meredith Oakes’ text, and so enlivening the actors’ dual commentary, that it works. More dubious are a handful of cuts to the score – none of them advantageous.In this production movement and elements of design are shared responsibilities. Visually the result is largely abstract, or else self-consciously located on a stage; but since the opera’s traditional Spanish setting is well known even to first timers, maybe it needs no further underlining.More importantly, Arden’s blending of the realistic and the conceptual makes for an intellectually stimulating as well as an effective evening’s theatre, while her exploration of the gender, class and racial politics underlying the action is focused and thought-provoking.Both vocally and dramatically, high standards are consistently maintained in the central performances. Like Don Giovanni, Carmen herself has to step onto the stage and immediately convince every member of the audience of her sexual allure – a task Israeli mezzo Na’ama Goldman achieves effortlessly, combining her intelligent portrayal with clean-edged, meaningful vocalism.Italian-American tenor Leonardo Capalbo presents Don Jose’s disturbing disintegration with varied and purposefully expressive tone. American soprano Shelley Jackson’s Micaela is strong-willed and individual – a necessary makeweight to Carmen in the dramatic scheme – while New Zealand baritone Phillip Rhodes’ Escamillo combines a macho image with inner emotional sensitivity. The secondary roles are all carefully sketched in.Vital engagement from both the festival’s chorus and the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, with conductor Jean-Luc Tingaud highlighting many subtle details as well as the overwhelming emotional punch of Bizet’s score."

What gives this show extraordinary visual appeal are her projections, which conjure up the nocturnal Athenian wood in richly atmospheric detail.Her use of mysterious shadows and silhouetted semblances, as well as a subtle alternation of black and white with colour, helps her differentiate between the disparate groups who interact therein. Add to this a directorial approach that hits exactly the right balance between lightness and seriousness that the piece requires to succeed, and the result is nigh-on flawless.Three of the central roles would be hard to better. Combining the unearthly beauty of his countertenor with a subtly intimidating manner, Iestyn Davies makes a haunting Oberon, his immaculate control perfectly matched by the translucent soprano and physical grace of Sophie Bevan’s Tytania. As Bottom, Matthew Rose’s grandly sonorous bass fleshes out a portrayal whose gentle humour sacrifices neither humanity nor pathos: indeed it is a mark of Jones’ sure touch that overtly comic scenes never lapse into slapstick.Between the four lovers, too, tension is balanced with lyricism, sadness with wit. The chorus of fairies is both ethereal and business-like and Jack Lansbury’s acrobatic Puck an absolute tour-de-force.In the pit conductor Ryan Wigglesworth leads the Aldeburgh Festival Orchestra in an account whose infallible pacing never detracts from the score’s sheeny sensuousness, making sure that what we hear is just as enchanting as what we see. "

When the curtain rises we see the ghost of the recently deceased Parker in the jazz club named after him, surrounded by images of the heroes and martyrs that are his jazz peers.Riccardo Hernandez’s spare but handsome sets add resonance to Bridgette A Wimberly’s workaday libretto. Later Parker relives more tangible encounters with key figures in his emotional and professional life. But it is an inevitable weakness of the piece that his iconic status has to be taken on trust.An imported cast does its best with sometimes intractable material. Tenor Lawrence Brownlee, more often associated with bel canto but here making brief forays into scat singing, is sympathetic in the lead even if occasionally covered by the 16-strong orchestra.Angela Brown brings heft to the predictably drawn role of Addie, Charlie’s mother, while baritone Will Liverman is a plausible Dizzy Gillespie. Chrystal E Williams, the young mezzo who plays the first Mrs Parker, is the night’s real discovery, a vocal powerhouse with superior acting ability."

Though it’s been attempted several times most notably by Ambroise Thomas, whose French grand opera of 1868 commands respect – thus far no one has turned Hamlet into an operatic masterpiece.Dean’s effort is an appreciable one. A highly skilled composer, he has produced a score whose sound-world is complex yet immediate, setting Matthew Jocelyn’s filleted edition of Shakespeare in a way that maintains narrative clarity, even if it is hard not to feel that some of the characters are a bit short-changed.With his discrete use of electronics, instrumental groups in the auditorium, eight singers performing wordlessly in the pit, plus an accordionist (James Crabb) prominent in the play-within-the-play sequence, he maintains a high level of musical interest, though one rarely feels that the score is at the centre of the dramatic experience.Neil Armfield’s production is clear and effective, and all of the leading roles are performed with conviction. Dominating scene after scene, Allan Clayton’s Hamlet is physically and vocally tireless. Rod Gilfry is the uneasy Claudius, Sarah Connolly engrossing in her growing desperation as Gertrude.Barbara Hannigan’s troubled Ophelia, David Butt Philip’s impassioned Laertes and Jacques Imbrailo’s honest Horatio all make notable contributions, while Kim Begley’s courtly Polonius and John Tomlinson’s compendium of roles – the Ghost of Hamlet’s father, the Gravedigger and the First Player – are memorable achievements.Conductor Vladimir Jurowski maintains firm control over a musical performance in which the London Philharmonic Orchestra and Glyndebourne’s chorus both excel; yet despite many fine qualities, the whole adds up to less than the sum of its parts. "

The architectural fragments of O’Connor’s set for the church of Sant’Andrea della Valle nevertheless look meagre, though the final scene atop the platform of Castel Sant’Angelo conjures genuine atmosphere.Yet as a dramatic whole the production feels conventional and short on tension. Part of the problem is right at the centre: Russian soprano Ekaterina Metlova is a tepid Tosca, a skilful singer but lacking in temperament and magnetism.Roland Wood offers a more solid Scarpia, vocally forthright and vivid, if short of some of the essential menace of Puccini’s super-villain.It’s in the evening’s star turn – the appearance of international tenor Joseph Calleja as Cavaradossi – that the performance really heats up. On magnificent vocal form, he suggests the painter’s devil-may-care impulsiveness and makes something unforgettable out of his last-act aria.Among the smaller roles, Scarpia’s henchmen – Adam Tunnicliffe’s Spoletta and Lancelot Nomura’s Sciarrone – form a sinister duo.In the pit Gianluca Marciano conducts the BBC Concert Orchestra in an efficient account of the score that allows some of its potency to register. But the evening is unsurprisingly dominated by the new opera house itself – and quite rightly so."

Both physically and vocally, Paul Nilon turns in an extraordinary Ulisse. Anna Bonitatibus’ Penelope takes a while to settle but goes on to convey movingly the barely controlled desperation of Ulisse’s beleaguered wife.There’s strong work from her three deplorable suitors – most notably a vocally resplendent Antinoo from Paul Whelan, who like one or two other cast members collects three roles over the course of the evening.Ronald Samm offers a larger-than-life comic turn as the gluttonous Iro while Thomas Elwin makes his mark with his direct Telemaco and Nigel Robson holds the attention as Eumete, the shepherd loyal to Ulisse.Tim Supple’s staging is a mixed affair, its physicality often engaging but its period-mixing and sometimes wacky costumes occasionally upstaging the characters who wear them; its tone is not so much ambiguous as uncertain. But Chance and the company demonstrate that the scale of the piece perfectly matches this 550-seat venue, which may well prove to be a portent of things to come."

Strong in particular offers an accomplished, vocally confident portrayal of Gilbert’s anti-hero.Adding a few contextual trimmings to the municipal green of the venue, Matthew Monaghan’s modern dress show reimagines a skit on Victorian pomposity as an up-close-and-personal critique of contemporary celeb excess. The lighting takes us from courtroom to ballroom but cannot impart the missing ingredient of charm.The 32-strong chorus – nicely differentiated jurymen sat opposite an interpolated cohort of wedding guests – feels disproportionately large in the absence of orchestral accompaniment. With niceties of style and instrumentation passed over, the evening retains the aura of a student jape despite taut and committed performances, including an able account of the piano reduction from Murray Hipkin."

Timing indicates that it was pure coincidence that Oliver Platt and his designer Neil Irish similarly place their production for Opera Holland Park on a liner, this time in the 1930s.Irish’s clever and adaptable set – a row of cabin doors which opens up to provide larger internal spaces – is one of the finest seen at this venue, and his costumes pinpoint class and period brilliantly.There are some skilfully realised ensemble scenes – even if at times the staging’s detail threatens to overwhelm the main action.But just as in Belfast the central concept hampers the show. While one can imagine Giovanni evading his pursuers in a large nocturnal city, on board a liner his task is that much harder. Instead of the famous statue-in-a-graveyard scene, Giovanni and Leporello come across the Commendatore’s body covered by a sheet in a larder. In the climactic supper scene, the notorious seducer is not dragged down to hell but throws himself overboard. None of this really works.There are worthwhile performances nevertheless. Lauren Fagan’s Donna Anna possesses strength and resilience, if not quite enough accuracy. Victoria Simmonds’ Donna Elvira combines edginess with determination – though how is it that Giovanni fails to recognise her undisguised in broad daylight? Ellie Laugharne makes a sparky Zerlina, well partnered by Ian Beadle’s dangerously volatile Masetto.Ben Johnson’s Don Ottavio is suavely delivered and John Savournin’s saturnine Leporello matches well with Ashley Riches’ dour, bullying Giovanni.But it’s in Dane Lam’s vital conducting and the clean-edged playing of the City of London Sinfonia that the performance shines most brightly."
159,"Der Rosenkavalier review at Wales Millennium Centre, Cardiff – ‘a stellar cast’",https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2017/der-rosenkavalier-review-wales-millennium-centre-cardiff/,Der Rosenkavalier,Wales Millennium Centre,Cardiff,4,2017-06-05,Steph Power,"Premiered in 1911, Der Rosenkavalier was a remarkable stylistic volte-face by Richard Strauss, eschewing previous dissonant extremes for a sumptuous romance steeped in Mozartian comic entanglements and Viennese waltz. Yet modernist anxieties abound in the very juxtaposition of such 18th- and 19th-century motifs within a quasi-parodistic, 20th-century frame.Not least is the sense of dislocated time which, in director Olivia Fuchs’ fin de siecle new production for Welsh National Opera, revolves around the Marschallin’s poignant response to growing older. It’s a triumphant role debut for soprano Rebecca Evans; shadowed by her future, elderly self (Margaret Baiton) as she relinquishes with searing ambivalence her young lover Octavian (an impetuous Lucia Cervoni) to the virginal Sophie (a delightfully forthright Louise Alder).Indeed, it’s the stellar cast more than the theatrical conceit – or even the assured playing of the WNO orchestra, which has further Straussian opulence to come under conductor Tomas Hanus – that makes this opera a must-see. While Fuchs risks over-playing a sands of time theme, it’s the lecherous arrogance of Baren Ochs (a superb Brindley Sherratt) that reveals Habsburg entitlement to be moribund – even ersatz.Finally it’s the bourgeois Faninal (a clear-voiced Adrian Clarke) who joins the aristocratic Marschallin in giving way to the future, as the silver rose brings its true giver and receiver together; a theme more Magic Flute than Marriage of Figaro – and serious despite the equally valid assertion, via Hofmannsthal’s libretto, that the opera is “a Viennese masquerade – that’s all.”Of course the real, tragic irony – suggested by Fuchs through video backdrop and more – is that the First World War would soon catapult the entire society into crisis."

But the results don’t always come off.A lot of effort has been put into Silent Opera’s reimagining of Janacek’s The Cunning Little Vixen. The tale may have originated in a newspaper strip cartoon, but it contains themes of mistrust and survival, and it explores the antagonism between sexual exploitation and awakening, and the relationship between love, desire, power and possession. The Vixen may be wily and worldly wise, but ultimately she fails to dodge the Poacher’s bullet. In many ways, the perfect operatic heroine.In the Silent Opera treatment the audience moves with the cast around the vaulted theatre spaces beneath Waterloo station. Through wireless headphones we hear live singing and ensemble playing mixed with an electronic rearrangement of the orchestral score.The underground setting aptly conveys an impression of life on the street, with danger lurking around every corner, but just as striking is the sheer talent and can-do energy of the entire cast. Most of them play as well as sing, always with conviction. Ivan Ludlow shines as the idealistic Forester, Robin Bailey exudes charm as the Fox and Rosie Lomas is simply magnetic as the Vixen.Director Daisy Evans exploits the physical setting by drawing out acting that is naturalistic and riveting, and storytelling of remorseless impact. This may not be for Janacek purists, but it’s without doubt a bold and deeply immersive experience."

From the first scene to the last, this new production radiates self-confidence and joy.This Figaro is set firmly but not pedantically in the late 18th century in which it was written. With veteran director John Cox at the helm, the pacing never falters and characterisations are never less than convincing. Duncan Rock is a swaggering Count Almaviva with Kirsten MacKinnon as his countess, who must suffer his betrayals and buffoonery. There’s believable affection between the servants Figaro (Joshua Bloom) and Susanna (Jennifer France), whose machinations to persuade the Count to give up his designs on Susanna drive the plot.The opera’s rich comedic side is carefully cultivated, with Timothy Robinson as the sycophantic fixer Basilio, Marta Fontanals-Simmons as the girl-mad teenager Cherubino and Stephen Richardson as the self-important Barolo. Special commendation goes to the excellent Janis Kelly as the social-climbing Marcellina, whose forceful personality is well matched by her costumes. The sumptuous costumes are by Robert Perdziola, also responsible for the moveable, multi-layered set; the collection of paintings on the wall in Act III could serve as a pub quiz for art historians.Musical delights abound, including the burnished bass of Joshua Bloom and the honeyed soprano of Kirsten MacKinnon. Douglas Boyd shows off the prowess of the fine Garsington Opera Orchestra by exploring lowest levels of pianissimo and daring the singers to match, a challenge particularly met by Jennifer France. Praise is due the ever-responsive continuo from Andrew Smith (fortepiano) and Helena Binney (cello).The audience cannot help but be enchanted by this magical Figaro, and even the occasional noisy helicopter flying above, cannot break its spell."

Juno’s half a dozen little girls run around periodically, and the climactic birth of Bacchus (son of Semele and the god Jupiter) brings forth a little toddler – aptly the real life-son of Heidi Stober, who sings Semele.Nicky Shaw’s designs include fitted bright-blue flight crew uniforms for the heavenly attendants and an evocative moonlit backdrop. As the sun sets outside Garsington’s airy pavilion theatre, the stage responds with illuminated moons and a candlelit memorial to Semele.But even more effective are the strong characterisations of Semele and Juno (Christine Rice). Far from being reduced to putty by Jupiter’s godliness, Semele is guided by her own desires, and Juno – amid the decidedly mortal bloating and wincing – is a force to be reckoned with. Both sing brilliantly, Stober bright-toned and ever-agile, and Rice luscious and effortlessly resonating. Robert Murray as Jupiter is a commanding presence if vocally less competitive and Jurgita Adamonyte as Ino amply balances comic touches with the interior anguish of admiring Athamas from afar.Under Jonathan Cohen the Garsington Opera Orchestra sparkles and the Chorus makes a strong impression too."

It’s an operatic misfit that began life as a frothy operetta, turned more serious, and boasts three versions of its final act.Major houses have frequently shunned it, but Opera Holland Park confidently launches its season with a new production, its third.The production shifts the setting from the 19th-century Paris to the same city in the early 1950s, which designer Takis joyfully populates with eye-catching tableaus. Act I’s cocktail party, with its women in flouncy dresses and a set dominated by a shade of turquoise most commonly associated with Fortnum and Mason, is especially striking.The time shift brings problems, however, not least in the plot assumption that the main character, Magda, is so ashamed of her past as a courtesan that she abandons her dream lover, Ruggero, when he proposes marriage.As Magda, Elizabeth Llewellyn does her best to overcome this incongruity with several affecting solo scenes, including an expressive Chi il bel Sogno di Doretta (though one wishes for more solidity in the top of her vocal range). As Ruggero, Matteo Lippi is vocally irreproachable but both he and Magda suffer from unwieldy stage direction that finds them awkwardly grappling together in key romantic moments.There’s lush support from the City of London Sinfonia under Matthew Kofi Waldren and the energetic Opera Holland Park Chorus.Tereza Gevorgyan as the flighty maid Lisette and Stephen Aviss as her sweetheart and would-be impresario, Prunier, remind us of La Rondine’s romcom roots, but Love, Actually it is not."

This myth is a fitting one for our times, as we reckon with the consequences of self-created environmental destruction.In the vast space of Studio 3 at Lilian Baylis House – once Decca’s recording studios, now ENO’s rehearsal space – a bleak, post-apocalyptic world is effectively evoked with little scenery and few props. The survivors plead with Woman/Mother – a commanding Rachael Lloyd – to relive the story. She tells how her son, Phaeton – William Morgan, who finds his stride after a rocky start – journeys to the palace of his father, the sun god Phoebus, played by a dramatically and vocally confident Robert Winslade Anderson.Phaeton persuades his father to let him drive the chariot of the sun across the sky, but the horses are too strong for him and disaster ensues. This climactic scene, as the boy brashly tries to master the horses, goes on too long, but his death, at the hands of his horrified father, and the aftermath are emotionally compelling.Dove’s score, well played by the ENO orchestra, and tinged with traces of Bernstein, Britten and early John Adams, is appealing despite not having a strong personal stamp.The ENO, under its new artistic director Daniel Kramer, is to be applauded for venturing out of its Coliseum home and turning the spotlight on the excellent ENO chorus for the first instalment of its ENO Studio Live initiative."

He brings Laurent Pelly’s production – which moves the plot to rural Italy in the 1950s – back to life.Some notable Royal Opera debuts make the first night genuinely special. Pride of place must go to South African soprano Pretty Yende, a rising star on the international scene, whose musicianship and technical skills are first-rate, and who makes proud, educated landowner Adina’s eventual realisation that she loves shy, not overly bright, Nemorino deeply affecting. Together with some fascinating detail, the general excellence of her performance keeps her right at the centre of attention.Also new to the company is Italian baritone Paolo Bordogna as bumptious heartthrob Sergeant Belcore. His interpretation is undoubtedly along the right lines, but if anything he’s inclined to overdo the physical comedy – there are a few too many forward thrusts of the hips – while the opera’s main comic role of travelling snake-oil salesman Doctor Dulcamara might be his more natural vocal territory.Taking the latter part and bringing to it a finer voice and a less clownish approach than usual is Italian Alex Esposito – one of the most consistently impressive actors on the operatic stage today, with a bass-baritone to match.But slyly stealing the show with his touchingly awkward characterisation of hapless Nemorino is Armenian tenor Liparit Avetisyan, who caps the evening with a stylish rendition of the famous tenor aria Una furtiva lagrima that draws a lengthy ovation from an audience which by that point is entirely hooked.The chorus and orchestra are both on excellent form, while conductor Bertrand de Billy ensures that Donizetti’s life-enhancing score goes with a swing."

For their success they depend on solid vocal standards not only from the men singing men’s roles, but also from the men singing women’s roles.Developing and maintaining focused falsetto throughout Sullivan’s entire soprano and contralto roles is no mean achievement. Here, Alan Richardson’s blissfully self-regarding Yum-Yum and Alex Weatherhill’s Katisha – who brings the character some crucial emotional grandeur and pathos amid the lacerating self-mockery – certainly deliver the goods, but all the female roles are done to a standard that never tips towards the upmarket drag act.It was GK Chesterton who first observed that The Mikado is set in a purely notional Japan which barely disguises a broad satire at the expense of the English – though it is hard to get a handle on Regan’s relocation of the piece to some sort of 1950s Enid Blyton-esque woodland school camp.An opening dance sequence choreographed to a rejigged overture and a pointless epilogue are the evening’s weakest sections. That so much of the rest does the trick is partly due to the material’s indestructibility, but there’s also a definite gain in momentum that lifts the second act from the tepid level of the first. One or two endless ‘comic’ pauses, though, are as yet unearned.There are several memorable individual performances, including Richard Munday’s likeably fatuous Nanki-Poo, James Waud’s authoritatively ghoulish Mikado and especially David McKechnie’s fluent Ko-Ko, who hurls himself gleefully into the manic mayhem of the cheap-tailor-turned-Lord High Executioner.Some tightening up is in order, and Sullivan would have insisted on purer sung vowels, but musical director Richard Baker does heroic work at the keyboard."

Yet Pop-Up Opera, presenting it as The Secret Marriage, reminds us that it is easy-drinking, operatic fizz and should be consumed in that spirit.The paper-thin plot centres on Carolina, daughter of the pompous social climber Geronimo, and Paolino, private secretary to the same. They have secretly married, and to avoid the wrath of her papa, they plot to marry off her sister, Elisetta, to Count Robinson.Plots are thwarted amid physical pratfalls and likable music that is at its most sparkling in the larger ensemble pieces. Four simple wooden chairs in bright crayon-box colours serve as props and complement Fiona Rigler’s excellent costumes.The performers sing in Italian with projected captions providing Tweet-length English precis of the libretto. This device is amusing (“Listen, I have a cunning plan”) but can feel limiting when the singers engage in lengthy recitativo dialogue.Director Max Hoehn’s production is touring the country with a double cast, and no wonder with all the physical business he demands. Blending seamlessly into the no-holds-barred spirit are the limber-voiced Chiara Vinci (Carolina), along with Peter Kirk (Paolino), Heather Caddick (Elisetta) and a slinky Vivien Conacher (Fidalma). Stellar work also from Peter Willcock as the exasperated Geronimo and Matthew Palmer as Count Robinson, who in his Union Jack waistcoat and a bicycle helmet reminds us that Gilbert and Sullivan owed something to opera buffa."

A few months later, offering steam-releasing farce and escapist comfort, onto that stage waltzed the operetta Die Fledermaus, Johann Strauss II’s great comic paean to life – and to middle-class fantasies of aristocratic wealth.Modern parallels are not hard to see, but for director John Copley (barring a pig’s head resembling a certain president) it’s fin-de-siecle frocks and frolics all the way in this Welsh National Opera revival, first seen in 2011 and opening the company’s ‘Vienna Vice’ season with uproarious, vulgar aplomb. Eisenstein and co might be ghastly social climbers – and revenge not so much sweet as dipped in sugar – but we laugh with, not at, them, relishing the entire song and dance through designer Tim Reed’s art-nouveau frame.Much of this is thanks to music director Tomas Hanus, making his WNO opera debut, who conducts the superb WNO chorus and orchestra with belle epoque panache – sometimes to the edge of gabbled (English) text. But the cast clearly enjoy themselves and each other, vocally and dramatically; Mary-Elizabeth Williams’ Rosalinde gives feminist zing to Mark Stone’s suavely stupid Eisenstein and Ben McAteer’s priggish Falke, while Paul Charles Clark (Alfred) and Alan Opie (prison governor) are especially richly absurd.Emma Carrington warms to Orlofsky’s unforgiving tessitura, while Rhian Lois excels as cheeky Adele. The gags fly everywhere thick and fast, but Act III plaudits go to Steve Speirs, whose deadpan, Tommy Cooper-meets-Dad’s Army gaoler turns an oft-tedious hiatus into stand-up gold."

For that opera to be based on one of the 20th century’s most significant Welsh-language plays is groundbreaking – and fraught with risk. However, composer Guto Puw and librettist Gwyneth Glyn have risen adroitly to the challenge with Y Twr (The Tower), Gwenlyn Parry’s 1978 drama charting the emotional journey of an unnamed couple from young love to old age.The tower is both living space and metaphor, secure yet claustrophobic. In director Michael McCarthy’s simple domestic setting for this Music Theatre Wales / Theatr Genedlaethol Cymru collaboration, a ladder signifies ascension to the next level at each new phase of life. Intimate yet commonplace, the drama is hugely reliant on the two-strong cast: the excellent mezzo Caryl Hughes and baritone Gwion Thomas who, as life-long lovers, mirror reality by being on-stage for the entire show – that is, until death intervenes.Time and transition is the point of their story; the process of ageing and its paradoxical unstable stability. McCarthy and designer Samal Blak conflate change and stasis with a ‘70s feel throughout, regardless of time passing. But it’s through Puw’s highly imaginative, modernist score that the ambivalences are felt – not least through subtle pacing and a deft balance of line and colour; memories evoked by a recurring distant train and traditional Welsh lullaby. It’s touchingly conveyed by the 12-piece Music Theatre Wales ensemble, who gain confidence under conductor Richard Baker’s able direction. An absorbing start to this year’s Vale of Glamorgan Festival, this is a landmark opera to catch on tour."

Sukanya is the name shared by Shankar’s widow, mother to Anoushka (who helped flesh out the score), and a legendary princess who accidentally blinds a sage, marries him to make amends and outwits the jealous deities who want her for themselves. Sadly the mainly English-language libretto, patchily projected on surtitles, makes little of the coincidence, offering neither poetry nor psychological insight. It is left to the production team to point to parallels in what remains an escapist evening.Remarkably, the platform successfully accommodates 55 players from the London Philharmonic and 20 black-clad BBC Singers, as well as a range of Western and Indian performers in gorgeous silks. The tiered layout allows for a central staircase of sorts, but the stage atmosphere comes mainly from evocative back projections and careful lighting. Despite the constraints, there is plenty of movement to delight the eye and Susannah Hurrell sings Sukanya with particular grace. The drawbacks include some inconsistent miking up of singers and a less tangible sense that the material needs greater intimacy. The fusion of American minimalist tropes with the rooted glitter of Indian harmony works well enough for one to hope for an early revival in a smaller space."

In practice, Hildegard Bechtler’s sets largely comprise a pair of curved walls – that on the right upholstered, that on the left mostly bland-looking. At the back are subtle but unrevelatory projections by Nina Dunn. Presaging the finale, in which Violetta’s condition overcomes her, each act opens with the heroine in bed, leaving her in Act 2 to receive the visiting Giorgio (Alfredo’s father) in nightie and dressing gown. In this updated version, Violetta pops pills in the final act and the ensemble (at one point stiffly front-facing) depart to leave her to die alone, weakening the impression of loss. If Act 1’s party scene appears a touch tame, that in Act 2 is enlivened by the choreography of the Gypsy and Toreador episodes.Within this sometimes ill-defined framing, Russian soprano Kristina Mkhitaryan makes a noteworthy Glyndebourne debut, conveying a woman of strength and resolve, but also one of warmth. In her vocal richness, athleticism and vivid colouring, she has everything the role demands. The same doesn’t quite go for her Alfredo, sung by Zach Borichevksy, who begins timidly but gathers strength through the evening. Igor Golovatenko may seem exaggeratedly severe upon his first arrival, but he sings Giorgio with assurance. Richard Farnes conducts with authority but it’s the singing, overall, that’s most impressive. A second run begins in August, with alternative casting of the three main roles, conducted by Andés Orozco-Estrada."

Now the company opens its season with a new production of the equally unknown Hipermestra, in what is only its second modern staging.This time around, Baroque specialist William Christie is in charge of the music, performed by himself and a small ensemble from the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment in perfect, up-to-scholarly-date, historically informed manner. Making a welcome return to the festival is former director of productions Graham Vick, whose last new staging for the company was in 2000.Premiered in Florence in 1658, Hipermestra is based on a Greek myth about regal twin brothers and mortal enemies Danao and Egitto. To escape a prophecy about his death, Danao marries his 50 daughters to Egitto’s 50 sons, secretly commanding his daughters to slaughter their husbands on their wedding night. All comply except Hipermestra, who saves her beloved Linceo – with devastating consequences played out over three long acts.Vick and designer Stuart Nunn move the visuals to the contemporary Middle East, where the grimly spectacular war-torn cityscapes have disturbing resonances. Wearing Arab dress, Christie and the other musicians are occasionally brought on stage and involved in the action – hilariously so when Mark Wilde’s mature drag-act wet-nurse Berenice launches herself at him with amorous intent.But it’s mostly a very serious show, the complex if not diffuse action skilfully conveyed by the director and a hard-working team of singers. There are standouts from Hungarian soprano Emoke Barath as a strong, sweet-toned Hipermestra, Italian counter-tenor Raffaele Pe’s troubled but undaunted Linceo, Benjamin Hulett’s violent Arbante, and Italian baritone Renato Dolcini’s desperate Danao – but the entire cast is impressive."

Its crackling tones transport the scene back to 1925. She removes her knitted hat to reveal chemo-induced baldness, and steps into her imagination.Having Mimi dying of cancer strengthens a contemporary audience’s bond with the character, while having her die of consumption in her imagination ensures that the opera itself is never compromised. Lee’s voice switches from frailty to gloriously coloured strength.Jeanine de Bique’s Musetta is a Josephine Baker-esque singer, complete with huge extravagant white furs. The harder tone to her voice contrasts well with Lee’s, adding an almost physical edge to those moments when they are singing together, either in duet or ensemble.Andrew Barbe’s set and costumes are attractive, with a strong art deco feel. Renaud Doucet’s production doesn’t stint on the romance either. Vocally, Luis Gomez has a lightness of touch as Rodolfo. His love for Mimi is never in doubt in a remarkably tender Act I duet. Yet his doubts in Act II, his fear of her impending death masked as jealousy, are as complex and interesting a take on the role as you could want. David Stout finds both the comedy and the tragedy in Marchello’s relationship with Musetta. "

Arkansas-born Kristin Lewis makes her surprise house debut as Elizabeth of Valois. Ekaterina Semenchuk is more predictably potent as Princess Eboli though even she takes time to warm up. A young-looking Ildar Abdrazakov can’t quite eclipse memories of Ferruccio Furlanetto’s resplendent, rock-solid King Philip – here the complexity of the character is only hinted at.The clearer narrative of Verdi’s five-act 1886 version is mostly well projected. While the rhythms could be crisper, Betrand de Billy’s pacing is sound.The traditional period costumes are complemented by sets poised between timeless spectacle and courtly claustrophobia. The red robes of the Grand Inquisitor are potent even if Paata Burchuladze, the veteran Georgian bass inhabiting them, has little voice left with which to convey the requisite sense of menace.Attempts have been made to de-clutter the auto-da-fe scene but this remains stylistically out of kilter. And in a de-mythologized denouement, Carlos is neither snatched from the clutches of the Inquisition nor headed for posthumous redemption."

His idea of turning the film into an opera apparently goes back some 15 years.There’s always a challenge involved in moving a work regarded as a masterpiece in one medium into another – but by the end of this particular evening one is left wondering what compelled Ades to set the film to music in the first place.The brilliance that marked every note of his smaller first opera, Powder Her Face, is only intermittently apparent. Bunuel tells his story in just 90 minutes. The operatic version, including a 25-minute interval, is nearly twice as long.The plot shows guests at an upmarket dinner party unaccountably discovering that they are unable to leave the room at the end of the evening: as days pass, their grip on civilised standards of behaviour becomes – disturbingly – ever looser.Cairns and Ades stick pretty well to the script while slimming it down – the film’s 17 guests are reduced to 12, which still allows a host of notable singers to appear in a production whose musical values are impressively high: Ades himself conducts.His score makes widespread use of the parodistic techniques that have regularly stood him in good stead, and there’s one particularly ironic quotation – when some inexplicably present sheep are on the point of being sacrificed by the now starving guests, we hear Bach’s Sheep May Safely Graze. Elsewhere there’s a preponderance of waltz rhythms reminiscent of Johann Strauss but orchestrated as if by Richard Strauss.While the score contains plenty of ingenious and inventive moments, an overall sense of musical structure or purposeful dramatic momentum is less evident.Many of the individual performances are nevertheless remarkable. Ades’ vocal writing is demanding, often taking singers right to the ends of their ranges and sometimes keeping them there. Amanda Echalaz’s impassioned soprano makes something exceptionally vivid out of Lucia, the dinner party’s hostess.Anne Sofie von Otter brings bags of character to the ailing Leonora. Audrey Luna’s extraordinary facility in her top register helps make opera singer Leticia extraordinarily memorable. Ed Lyon and Sophie Bevan gain sympathy as doomed young lovers Eduardo and Beatriz.Taken as a whole, the staging is a remarkable company achievement, with numerous standouts, but the opera itself doesn’t really hit the nail on the head."

Jaho has gained a substantial following at the Royal Opera House, and indeed worldwide, for the intensity and intelligence of her dramatic portrayals: those who saw her as Puccini’s Sister Angelica will never forget the experience.She’s an authentic star, and once again the detail and depth of her interpretation mark it out as special; but there are moments, particularly as this unusually long and arduous role reaches its later and most punishing stages, when her essentially lyric tone is overwhelmed by the demands Puccini’s writing places upon it.Puente makes a notable company debut as Pinkerton. Physically he’s an ideal representative of the role, with fine acting skills on display, while vocally his sense of style and individual tone are major pluses; if he is able to strengthen his slightly hesitant top register he will carry all before him.Scott Hendricks makes a highly sympathetic if light-toned Sharpless and fellow American Elizabeth DeShong repeatedly finds out the heart of Butterfly’s worldly wise loyal servant Suzuki.The smaller roles also go well. Carlo Bosi gives the marriage-broker Goro full three-dimensionality and Yuriy Yurchuk offers pride and purpose as the love-sick Prince Yamadori. Jeremy White’s intervention as Butterfly’s Buddhist priest uncle the Bonze carries the essential note of terrifying authority.Once again in the pit, the Royal Opera’s music director Antonio Pappano demonstrates an unerring feeling for the detail and dramatic momentum of score that place him in the very top league of Puccini interpreters. The orchestra plays marvellously for him."

She (literally – her character is given only as ‘Elle’) is put through the emotional wringer, her feelings of anger, rejection, insecurity and jealousy – and the admission of taking an overdose – savagely undercut by the banal, as well as by frequent interruptions from the operator or other callers on the line.For Elle, the telephone offers a way of modulating the rawness of her feelings for her caller, but to the audience it is a ringing reminder that the crossed wires run deep; with each interruption, we see that she is more desperate to re-establish a connection with her lover.Directed by Marie Lambert, Anne Sophie Duprels opens at an already heightened level of irritation, making a strong impact from the start but also limiting the emotional field. Her command of the role is complete, lending directness to the recitative-like writing (which she works hard to sustain in the unflattering acoustic of the Elgar Room at the Royal Albert Hall), and luminous in the song-like passages which occasionally shine through. Eminent French pianist Pascal Rogé takes on the role of the orchestra with equal assurance.The artists are let down by the designs, from Duprels’ dowdy nightdress and gown to the ill-conceived lighting. Worst of all, the ultra-low budget set consists of bed frame apparently formed from scraps found in a primary school art class cupboard."

The plot is often written off as indecipherable, but William Relton’s staging maintains interest and dramatic momentum.Faramondo was the legendary first king of the Franks, but since the earliest historical mention of him comes several centuries after he supposedly lived, the evidence that he ever existed is pretty meagre. The opera’s plot, consequently, is pure fiction. Placing the action, as Relton and designer Cordelia Chisholm do, in a West Side Story-like environment of gangs and nightclubs seems as good a way of dealing with it as applying a kind of faux-medievalism.Like most of Handel’s operas, Faramondo tells a complex tale of dynastic feuds and generational conflicts, with most of the characters in love with the wrong person right up to the denouement, when matters are – as far as possible – put to rights.In Relton and Chisholm’s visualisation, this is the era of teddy boys and switchblades, with Kieran Rayner’s tough guy Gustavo the competitive owner of the club where Beth Moxon’s suave Rosimonda is the torch singer; but Gustavo also has his gang, opposed by those of rival hard men Gernando and Faramondo.Relton helps the cast achieve dramatic performances as well defined as the related vocal offerings. Moxon puts her arias over with the panache of a cabaret star. A magnetic stage performer, Swedish mezzo Ida Ranzlov makes an outstandingly assured Faramondo.Countertenor Timothy Morgan enjoys Gernando’s villainy and demonstrates serious vocal potential. Harriet Eyley is spirited as Faramondo’s sister, Clotilde. Josephine Goddard’s measured Adolfo, Harry Thatcher’s dangerous Teobaldo and Lauren Morris’s skilful Childerico complete the central casting, while Handel expert Laurence Cummings presides over a stylish orchestral performance."

One of them, Arsace, is torn between Partenope and his former fiancee, Rosmira, who has come to check out the lie of the land disguised as the soldier Eurimene. Complex emotional entanglements provide the motivation for the innumerable arias that make up the work’s musical fabric.Alden and his design team transfer the action, however, to a Parisian salon in the 1920s, when the Surrealists were all the rage: Emilio, another one of Partenope’s suitors, is specifically got up as artist-photographer Man Ray.It all makes for a visually chic show, perfectly complemented by Amanda Holden’s witty translation, even if the switch of location and period scarcely feels an inevitable one.What gives the evening consistency are the cast’s excellent vocal skills, which enable them to tackle Handel’s virtuosic writing with aplomb. Sarah Tynan is a commanding Partenope, wooed by Rupert Charlesworth’s high-energy Emilio, Patricia Bardon’s grand-scale Arsace, and James Laing’s elegant Armindo. Matthew Durkan is resolute as Partenope’s loyal supporter, Ormonte, and Stephanie Windsor-Lewis seizes all opportunities with her powerfully sung Rosmira.Taking charge in the pit, meanwhile, conductor Christian Curnyn superintends a performance combining vivacity with delicacy."

This tale of rival pseudo-poets worshipped by rapturous maidens while themselves fighting over the plain-speaking titular milkmaid, remains as sharp and funny as ever.Director Liam Steel unapologetically retains the piece’s late Victorian setting, his production ensconced in William Morris-like patterns realised by Florence de Mare, whose flamboyant outfits for preening poets Bunthorne and Grosvenor are magnificent works of art.Bradley Travis is a delightfully hyperactive Bunthorne, a torrent of nimble, louche gestures. Resplendent in an Albertian mane, Ross Ramgobin’s strutting Grosvenor is an ideal foil. Valerie Reid brings humour and dignity to the old maid part of Lady Jane.As Colonel Calverley, head of the hapless dragoon guards to whom the maidens were engaged before Bunthorne’s arrival, Andrew Slater gives a terrific rendition of his fiendish patter song. Soprano Lauren Zolezzi’s Patience is beautifully sung, but sometimes strays incongruously into serious drama.Laden with smart visual gags and lively choreography, the production well serves one of Gilbert’s funniest works. Sullivan’s score doesn’t consistently match the glories of The Pirates of Penzance and others, but there are plenty of musical gems – notably heart-stopping sextet I Hear the Soft Note and effervescent earworm, If Saphir I Choose to Marry. Conductor Timothy Burke ensures a generally spritely pace, and the ETO chorus and orchestra are superb."

Wagner’s opera is set in mid-16th century Nuremberg, but for some inscrutable reason Holten sets it in a gentlemen’s club in modern London, making large stretches of the action completely nonsensical.Illustrations in the programme booklet highlight references to conservative British institutions – several with both small and large Cs. It’s hard not to suspect that the production is at least partly a comment on the lukewarm response Holten’s work has received locally; if so, Wagner’s opera and its audience deserve to be taken more seriously.The show comes together, though, for the final scene, where the blend of ancient and modern seems more purposeful, while the humiliation of Johannes Martin Kranzle’s exceptional Beckmesser is just as troubling as it should be.In other respects Terfel is superb as Hans Sachs, while both he and Gwyn Hughes Jones’ wiry Walther deserve medals for stamina. Rachel Willis-Sorensen makes a striking Eva, while Allan Clayton’s confident, detailed David is outstanding.Despite strong work from both chorus and orchestra and Antonio Pappano’s considerable Wagnerian experience, the show’s musical momentum is also fitful, though once again gaining strength as we head towards the grandeur of the close."

Rage against the machine, as Cavaradossi does in trying to shelter his political friend Angelotti, and you will pay the price, as he and his beloved Tosca do at the hands of the police chief Scarpia.The English Touring Opera’s new Tosca, which begins its three-month national tour at the Hackney Empire, is an accomplished first operatic outing for theatre director Blanche McIntyre. The set and costume designs (by Florence de Mare) suggest Goya’s Napoleonic Spain more than the 18th-century Rome of the opera. There’s a Iberian flavour to the costumes too but most striking is the Moorish-patterned walkway that slashes diagonally across the stage.Tosca here is not the usual grand diva but instead an impulsive, and all-to-soon disillusioned, naïf, well portrayed by Paula Sides, who is spellbinding in the great Vissi d’arte aria. Alexander James Edwards as Cavaradossi offers a warm and well-rounded sound. Craig Smith as Scarpia is vocally polished, but with his severe bearing, his interactions with Tosca suggest a desire for conquest rather than passion.This central trio is well-supported by secondary characters such as Aled Hall’s menacing Spoletta. Good work also from the ETO orchestra strings, and from the chorus, who sing a Te Deum as Scarpia brutally plots against his enemies – one of many dramatic contrasts between spiritual aspiration and grasping humanity that Puccini places into his score."

From several points of view the result is clearly the major event of ENO’s current season.It certainly has a lot going for it. Kinnear offers an intelligent reading of the much rewritten, cut-down text – Autolycus is one of the major Shakespearean elements to disappear completely – demonstrating considerably more savoir faire than many experienced practitioners of operatic staging.Vicki Mortimer’s sets and Moritz Junge’s costumes suggest authoritarian societies of the mid-20th century for both Sicilia and Bohemia, respectively ruled with destructive patriarchal zeal by Iain Paterson’s insanely jealous Leontes and Leigh Melrose’s control-freak Polixenes.Other individual performances are equally strong, with Sophie Bevan a dignified Hermione, Neal Davies doubling convincingly as Antigonus and the Shepherd, and Susan Bickley’s Paulina consistently rising to eloquent heights. The younger generation is represented by Samantha Price’s spontaneous Perdita and Anthony Gregory’s exuberant Florizel.Benefiting from the full commitment of ENO’s excellent orchestra and chorus, Wigglesworth’s score is an accomplished piece of work, demonstrating in this debut opera the skills that have earned him a high-ranking position amongst British composers of his generation.Yet however finely achieved the result may be, it rarely maximises the operatic potential of the material. Pressing urgently onwards towards the next unexpected narrative twist may be a plus, but there are times when a more expansive musical response is needed. From many points of view this is an admirable evening, but it seems that the play has once again eluded the operatic medium."

Vocal standard is high – the four Bohemians, especially Vitalii Liskovetski’s Rodolpho and Iurie Gisca’s Marcelo, would not disgrace the stage of Covent Garden. Though not the most youthfully energetic bunch, their clownish antics in the final act draw plenty of laughs. Alyona Kistenyova’s graceful Mimi and Olga Perrier’s glamourous Musetta fit the bill too.Kent’s direction is unradical but sound; the only small disappointment, despite a well-populated stage and Kent’s trademark live animal cameo (in this case local dog Molly), is lack of definition in the chorus milling in the Cafe Momus scene. The Act I and IV set consists of old-fashioned but effective painted flats of Parisian rooftops; the continually falling snow throughout Act III, and large gnarled tree, make more of an impression.The small orchestra, nominally the National Philharmonic of Moldova, is rough around the edges, but held together well by conductor Vasyl Vasylenko, who maintains a lively pace and authentic Puccini-esque sweep.Kent’s solidly traditional, musically dependable productions clearly perform an important, much appreciated service."

Snow is a composite work, with one librettist telling three stories all related to Snow White, each of them set by a different composer. The show takes place on three floors of the CLF Art Cafe, with performers and audience moving downwards as the evening proceeds.J L Williams constructs a libretto that takes a figure best known from a Disney cartoon on a dark journey, though the successive episodes have diverse origins.In The Three Ravens, set by Lewis Murphy, Snow White is the cause of dissension between the King and his second wife – the girl’s mother having died in childbirth.In Lucie Treacher’s The Death of the Seven Dwarves, the diminutive miners whose cottage Snow White imagines breaking into meet a terrible fate. The final opera, Tom Floyd’s The Crystal Casket, is the longest and the most musically complex, with a Prince and his mother arguing over the dead body of Snow White, who eventually comes back to life.All three scores have their virtues, each setting the text clearly and with a sense of atmosphere, though the individual vocal lines possess less character than the accompaniment for 12-piece ensemble, convincingly delivered here under conductor Christopher Stark.Murphy’s score provides a subtle and delicate beauty, if not quite enough variety of pace, Treacher’s an uneasy nervous energy and some clever offstage choral effects; but Floyd’s piece offers the greatest textural and coloristic range, bringing the evening to a powerful close.James Hurley’s production works effectively in Rachel Szmukler’s straightforward sets and each of the five singers makes an appreciable mark. Alice Privett’s vulnerable Snow White links all three pieces, with Rick Zwart’s strong baritone making a particularly notable impression as the King and Prince Raven."

Giles Cadle’s adaptable unit structure once again sets the scene, though so cunningly has he redesigned it that you would never recognise it.Director/choreographer Aletta Collins turns the familiar locations – a rundown baronial hall and a palace – into a dance school run by Cinderella’s cruel stepfather Don Magnifico for the benefit of his star performers, her stepsisters Clorinda and Tisbe: the Italian text, incidentally, makes no reference to their appearance – their unattractiveness is purely behavioural.Another unusual feature – at least if you’re expecting the panto version – is that no magic is involved: Cinderella is befriended by Prince Ramiro’s philosopher tutor, though his name (Alidoro translates as Golden-Wings) suggests that he’s an angel in disguise. But Collins’s action transfer seems to run out of steam pretty quickly and doesn’t really justify itself.Yet there’s a feel-good factor to the show that is partly down to a solid musical performance under conductor Wyn Davies of what is usually regarded as the composer’s warmest-hearted comedy, but also due to sensitive and skilful dramatic performances in all the central roles.Singing with commendable accuracy and touching personality, Canadian mezzo Wallis Giunta shines in the title role. She’s partnered by the exciting South African tenor Sunnyboy Dladla, whose confident top register, vocal fluency and presence ensure him success as Ramiro. Henry Waddington is a grandly mean-spirited Don Magnifico, while Sky Ingram’s Clorinda and Amy J. Payne’s Tisbe vie with one another at preening and prancing. Quirijn de Lang’s Dandini sounds a little thin but offers bags of courtier charm, while John Savournin brings gravitas to Alidoro. "

Even though like most of Martin’s neglected output, Le Vin Herbe remains infrequently performed, his preference for purely concert performances has regularly been ignored.Polly Graham’s production for Welsh National Opera (whose artistic director David Pountney suggests that in English the title should be rendered as The Spiked Drink) could thus be seen as a betrayal of Martin’s intentions, especially given that a piece designed for just 12 voices is here sung by almost as many principals plus a chorus of 40.Yet in many respects the performance is remarkably faithful to the restraint and reticence of a piece that is the direct opposite to Wagner’s far more famous and expressively extreme setting of more or less the same story.Graham explains that she and her designers have set the piece in the empty shell of a theatre: conductor James Southall and his small ensemble are placed centre stage, though often hidden by the chorus; as narrators of the action, the latter’s contribution, meanwhile, is vital.That the whole show – played without an interval – weaves a magical spell is testament not only to the sympathy and intelligence with which Graham has approached her task but to the excellence of the chorus as lynchpin and to Southall’s focused leadership of his instrumental team.All the principal performances are memorable, with exceptional contributions from Howard Kirk as the betrayed, conflicted King Mark and Gareth Dafydd Morris as Tristan’s loyal friend Kaherdin. But the bulk of the evening’s burden falls on Tom Randle’s austere, troubled Tristan and Caitlin Hulcup’s eloquent Iseult, and they do not disappoint, their finely tuned performances perfectly matching the subtlety and discrimination of Martin’s delicate score."

Based on tales from the 1,001 Nights, and its framing story in which Scheherazade evades execution by recounting the cliff-hanging tales to King Sharyar, it begins on the 999th night, and so follows the last three tales.The multiple songs nested within the first tale rather stunt the dramatic flow before it gets going, but Peter Brooke’s resonant Haroun and Philippa Boyle’s luscious Abbasa (Haroun’s sister) are ideally matched. Boyle also sings the role of Shahrazad, bringing a hypnotic quality to her exotic modal writing as well as cleanly chiselled consonants. In the subsequent night’s story, concerning the forbidden love of Prince Jasmine and Princess Almond, both parts are sung by females – novel but unnecessary – with the other roles taken by the versatile Martin Lamb. The final tale is a continuation of the first, drawing on themes of infanticide and filicide.Scored for piano, oboe/cor anglais, violin, cello and tabla, Dhondy’s music cautiously rolls in Eastern elements, but is just as likely to draw on jazz, as in the 999th night’s Song of Jasmine. But while the vocal writing is pliable and expressive the ensemble writing is often bland and texturally one-dimensional.
The sweeping and exotic narrative of these tales has inspired enticing sound-worlds from Rimsky Korsakov, Ravel and others. Dhondy’s score lacks richness by comparison, though director Nina Brazier makes ingenious use of the intimate space."

That’s a fair question to ask about the King’s Head Theatre very compact production of Puccini’s Madam Butterfly, in a new English version by Amanda Holden.Cutting out subplots pares away an hour of running time and gives this Butterfly an immediacy and dynamism underscored by Holden’s clear-eyed and supple English libretto. However, director Paul Higgins’ decision to relocate this tragic tale to a modern Japanese ‘Maid Cafe’, where young women in manga comics costumes cater to male erotic fantasies, is less surefooted. Madam Butterfly could arguably find herself isolated for years in a house in the opera’s original setting (1904 Nagasaki), but surely not an iPhone age when she would have obsessively tracked down the two-timing Pinkerton via Facebook.Praise is nonetheless due to the manga atmosphere created by the set (Luke W Robson), lighting (Nic Farman) and costumes (Emily May Sions) even if it is nearly irrelevant by the final two acts when Becca Marriott  gives a spine-tingling performance as the abandoned Butterfly. She has sympathetic support from Sarah Denbee as the loyal Suzuki and Sam Pantcheff as the guilt-ridden Sharpless; Matthew Kimble (Pinkerton) looks part of the confident American even if his vocal prowess doesn’t quite match. The night belongs to Marriott and one hopes she’ll be able unleash that power some day on a larger stage."

Puccini subtitled his opera “a Japanese Tragedy”, and honed the score to maximum tear-jerker effect. But it is far from being merely an unhappy romantic tale of American sailor boy jilts geisha girl.Within the sepia tints of designer Reinhart Zimmerman’s shōji-screened interior, subtly lit by John Waterhouse, the terrible reality for Cio-Cio-San of sex tourism and cultural oppression is plain to see – and hear, as conductor Lawrence Foster pits orientalist inflection against The Star-Spangled Banner in knowing, ironic juxtaposition.The Yankee superiority of Jonathan Burton’s lyrically-sung Pinkerton appalls, but his casual cruelty breaks the heart; for Cio-Cio-San – sung with restrained poise yet full-bodied passion by Karah Son – is seduced into a delusion of shared love despite being sold into disposable marriage.David Kempster’s consul, Sharpless, proves a far more humane go-between than the suitably revolting broker, Goro (Simon Crosby Buttle). Yet neither he nor the devoted maid, Suzuki – an increasingly furious Rebecca Afonwy-Jones – can stop the inevitable; “Mrs Pinkerton’s” obsession with Americana only heightens the torment.If the final, dreadful scene could be more solidly climactic, its power is nonetheless intense: Cio-Cio-San’s suicide – by her father’s already bloodied ritual knife, in front of the son whom Pinkerton returns to buy – is almost unbearable. And yet the story remains echoed in reality today in many forms. That the superb WNO chorus and orchestra have it musically in their bones is stirringly evident."

Composer, performer and bee-keeper Heloise Tunstall-Behrens, however, is fascinated by the industrious insects whose pollinating activities ultimately feed us all. Her reading of Thomas Seeley’s Honeybee Democracy, which contends that bees make collective, democratic decisions, sparked the creation of The Swarm, a category-defying show at the Vault Festival that premiered last year at the Brunel Museum in Rotherhithe.Wearing soft cotton dresses and with their faces dotted with metallic paint, nine female performers sing, dance, and act their way through the tale of a swarm of honey bees who leave their hive to follow a desposed queen bee. The journey is not without its trials, as the swarm flies through a disorientating storm on its search for a new home. Cooperative they may be, yet bees interact with each other individually, demonstrating autonomy in the midst of the collective. Audience members in the vast vault may miss these interactions, though, as the performers shift from standing to lying down.The acoustics of the space are a challenge as well: the high, arched ceilings and the rumble of Waterloo trains above can blur the details of the soundscape and of the music, which is based on the resonant buzzing and humming of bees, and mixes styles from multilayered vocals to call-and-response tribal chants.The programme handout contains much intriguing bee information, demonstrating that Tunstall-Behrens knows her beeswax, but The Swarm is in need of a more detailed pre-flight briefing before it can truly soar."

On the one hand, debutant opera director Mike Leigh and his designer Alison Chitty have created an abstract world of geometrically shaped, brightly coloured panels that do little to delight the eye.But the joy of the show, with conductor Gareth Jones at the helm, is just how much it delights the ear. It’s not just the waltzing playfulness of Sullivan’s enchanting score or the wicked intricacy of WS Gilbert’s lyrics that are an enduring pleasure, but also the verve and delight of the orchestra, principals and chorus in putting them across. Soroya Mafi brings a shimmering coloratura soprano to Mabel, and is ideally partnered by the dashing David Webb who has an effortless vocal lyricism as Frederic, the man she falls in love with.Elsewhere luxury casting abounds among the seniors: the Sergeant of Police is playfully taken by ENO veteran John Tomlinson, tufts of white hair spilling from his helmet; Lucy Schaufer brings her radiant vocal colours to the desperate Ruth; and Andrew Shore is in full command of the tongue-twisting declaration to being the very model of a Modern Major General. They are an unalloyed delight."
194,Adriana Lecouvreur review at Royal Opera House – ‘singing of rare subtlety’,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2017/adriana-lecouvreur-review-at-the-royal-opera-house-london/,Adriana Lecouvreur,Royal Opera House – ‘singing of rare subtlety’,Adriana Lecouvreur review at Royal Opera House,4,2017-02-07,George Hall,"The Royal Opera celebrates the 25th anniversary of Angela Gheorghiu’s international debut at the house in 1992 with a revival of Adriana Lecouvreur, Cilea’s enjoyable if stagey melodrama loosely based on the life and death of the legendary 18th-century French tragedienne.Played out in Charles Edwards’ intricate sets – which begin with a lifelike representation of the backstage area of the Comedie-Francaise in the 1720s, and then develop the notion of artifice and reality merging in the life of the artist herself – David McVicar’s broadly traditional production maintains narrative clarity in a piece whose manifold twists and turns need and here receive careful exposition. Visually the result is as entertaining as the opera itself.Gheorghiu is surrounded by a fine supporting cast, with baritone Gerald Finley offering a touching character study of Michonnet, the stage manager forlornly in love with the star. Delivered on a grand scale is luscious-voiced Uzbekistani mezzo Ksenia Dudnikova’s account of Adriana’s ruthless royal rival, the Princesse de Bouillon, while American tenor Brian Jagde is boundlessly stentorian if a little stiff dramatically as Maurizio, Count of Saxony, the unscrupulous military adventurer they’re both unaccountably mad about.While not attempting to match their vocal weight, Gheorghiu commands admiration with a skilled, thought-through acting performance and singing of rare subtlety and fascinating nuance, with some exquisite expressive effects of the kind few sopranos would attempt and even fewer manage to bring off. Adriana Lecouvreur is a diva’s opera, and Gheorghiu does not disappoint.Nor do those allotted the secondary roles, with memorable standouts from Balint Szabo as the deceptive and deceived Prince de Bouillon, and Krystian Adam as his camp clerical sidekick the Abbe de Chazeuil. In the pit, conductor Daniel Oren brings a keener sense of momentum to this score than on some previous appearances."

Yet here it is again for the 13th time. The relocation to Little Italy no longer startles as it did in 1982 but the narrative is crystal clear. There is danger as well as beauty in the mean streets evoked by Miller’s regular designers.The Edward Hopper-esque bar for the final act, in which Madeleine Shaw shines again as a sensual Maddalena, has always looked a treat, while the old jukebox joke launching La Donna e Mobile still raises a laugh. That said, the pitfalls of complacency are not entirely avoided by revival director Elaine Tyler-Hall. Miller himself, on hand to acknowledge the applause of the first night audience, secured a tighter show in 2009.In the pit, Richard Armstrong directs an uncut text with relish and no interpolated high notes; the dynamic range is wide, brass unashamedly demonstrative, choral work impeccable. The all-American principals prove less sure-footed. As Rigoletto, here a jesting bartender, Nicholas Pallesen has a warmer, softer-grained baritone than is usually associated with the role and takes an age to find his customary focus. Much touted Joshua Guerrero makes an unexceptionable UK debut as the Duke of Mantua turned mobster.Only Sydney Mancasola is in any way special as Gilda. The finest actor of the three, she is radiant and glittering in the more stratospheric writing, her biggest problem being a tendency to gulp. James Fenton’s translation is projected with variable clarity so the surtitles help. They are not needed for Nicholas Folwell’s Monterone and Barnaby Rea’s Sparafucile, both outstanding."

Edward Dick’s production sets the action of the Brothers Grimm original on a contemporary English estate, with penniless parents Peter and Gertrud living in a rundown flat with an empty fridge and two hungry young mouths to feed.Katie Bray’s boyishly boisterous Hansel and Fflur Wyn’s more mature Gretel use smartphones, but mostly play with their handheld camera, filming the games that clearly fill the long gaps between meals.Projected onto Giles Cadle’s council house set, Ian William Galloway’s video sequences take us deep into the forest, with its creepy shades of The Blair Witch Project.They also provide the unforgettable visuals for the lengthy Dream Pantomime sequence, in which the kids’ kindly old granny – finely delivered by Rachel J Mosley who also sings the role of the Sandman – takes them on an archetypally blissful day at the seaside, complete with fish and chips drowned in ketchup.It sounds banal, but together with Humperdinck’s magical score, which Opera North’s orchestra plays magnificently under the perceptive baton of Christoph Altstaedt, it brings Act II to a close that goes right to the vulnerable heart of a piece about childhood and deprivation.But there’s plenty of fun, too. The humour is often dark – as it must be in a Freudian but plausible reading of the opera in which dramatic soprano Susan Bullock plays both the kids’ stressed-out mother and the Witch whom they eventually shove into the oven. Bullock benefits from her Wagnerian vocal background and has a whale of a time.Stephen Gadd is in fine voice as the alcoholic dad, with Amy Freston a business-like Dew Fairy. With everyone focusing keenly on text, David Pountney’s English version comes up trumps."

He suffered from a condition called polyphagia, whose sufferers consume enormous amounts of food – in his case not only gigantic meals, but also live animals and snakes, and even amputated limbs.Puppetry – skilfully deployed throughout the show – seems the perfect (and perhaps the only) medium for such a narrative. In all some 20 puppets are involved, though it is the face of the tragic central figure – his expression registering a mixture of amazement and dismay – that will haunt you long after the piece ends.His eating and regurgitating of all manner of things, meanwhile, is at times quite revoltingly convincing.
Yet in the end one feels for this hapless individual, exploited by just about everyone he meets during his misadventures, not excluding the French Revolutionaries who enlist him as a spy who can hide secret messages in his stomach.Though nominally an opera, much of composer/concert pianist Tom Poster’s score could pass as a musical. It’s impressively sung by Michael Longden and Daniel Harlock, and it’s not their fault if the result is more amiable than memorable, with influences such as Kurt Weill and Sondheim often giving way to something altogether more generic."

Beautiful, wealthy, flamboyant, sexually voracious, she was the epitome of upper class 1930s decadence; the perfect operatic heroine. A notorious incident amongst her string of widely publicised affairs resulted in the so-called ‘headless man’ photograph, rendering Thomas Ades’ saucy chamber opera the first in the genre to stipulate an act of fellatio in its stage directions.20 years on, Antony McDonald’s pacy, cleverly designed Irish premiere feels fresh and cool. The whole thing reeks of sex, from the naughty antics of Daire Halpin’s hysterical maid and Adrian Dwyer’s swaggering electrician to the kinky fetishes of Stephen Richardson’s colossal Duke and the unfettered promiscuity of Mary Plazas’ predatory Duchess.Layered narrative gives way to an exuberant canter through the squalid peccadilloes of the rich and famous and the salacious observations of a public, which is both appalled and fascinated by them. Ades’ tinkly, swooning, tango-flavoured orchestration is perfectly partnered by Philip Hensher’s witty libretto. It encapsulates the sexual inequality of the day through the devastating verdict of a High Court judge who, while revelling in the details of Margaret’s scandalous misdemeanours, declares her unfit for marriage. In her seduction of a hapless waiter, her ecstatic, necessarily wordless, aria provides a high-octane finale to the first act. But the dramatic climax arrives in the final scene when Plazas crafts a long moment of breathless despair, rendering the ageing Margaret a pathetic figure, resorting to her familiar tricks in a desperate effort to avoid eviction from her opulent hotel suite as the bills go unpaid."
199,"La Boheme review at Wales Millennium Centre, Cardiff – ‘a polished revival’",https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2017/la-boheme-review-wales-millennium-centre-cardiff-2/,La Boheme,Wales Millennium Centre,Cardiff,4,2017-01-30,Steph Power,"Puccini’s beloved La Boheme is founded on a combination of grim reality and romantic pathos that is either glorious or problematic depending on whether one minds the heartstrings being very firmly tugged. Either way, his dramatic achievement is formidable. The bohemians are freezing and destitute yet their bonhomie and ardent loves warm the soul with irrepressible joie de vivre; the stricken Mimi heroically refuses to die before reconciling with her suffering, once-jealous Rodolfo.Director Annabel Arden’s Welsh National Opera production builds on the work’s fin de siecle sensibilities with a Christmas setting in pre-First World War Paris. First seen in 2012, the strength of this polished revival lies in straightforward storytelling, and the result – despite some unruly orchestral phrasing and balance from conductor Manlio Benzi – charms without recourse to the sentimental. The set is evocatively designed and lit by Stephen Brimson Lewis and Tim Mitchell; grey garrets and cold blizzards contrast with cerulean rooftop vistas and the festive colour of an authentic Cafe Momus.The cast are an engagingly wise yet innocent gaggle in an opera which turns on the challenges of becoming adult. Lauren Fagan’s coquettish Musetta is desperate for a better life, but stays to infuriate and excite Gary Griffiths’s fretful Marcello. Marina Costa-Jackson’s Mimi proves more sumptuous than fragile of tone, defying easy martyrdom. Her Rodolfo, Dominick Chenes, is sometimes splintery at higher register, but conveys believable emotional extremes; Jihoon Kim (Colline) and Gareth Brynmor John (Schaunard) provide touching moral and vocal support. Most poignant is the final vision of Mimi, lying dead and starkly alone on a stage which is darkened but for a bare white spotlight."

What is apparently his 26th opera, The Trial is based on the novel by Franz Kafka that became one of the defining texts of the 20th century, poised halfway between a dream and a nightmare.If only because of its iconic status, it’s an ambitious choice of subject. The experienced Christopher Hampton – who has collaborated with Glass on two previous operatic works – provides the skilful libretto. The black comedy had its world premiere at the Linbury Studio Theatre in 2014 under the auspices of Music Theatre Wales – a leading proponent of contemporary works.Now Scottish Opera – co-producer as well as co-commissioner of the piece – brings Michael McCarthy’s economical but highly effective staging to audiences in Glasgow and Edinburgh.Coming to it afresh, it’s hard not to notice how awkward Glass’s setting of the English text is – something that does not apply to works such as Satyagraha or Akhnaten, which set ancient or exotic languages. Often the vocal lines sound as if merely stuck onto an existing instrumental texture – here Scottish Opera’s Head of Music Derek Clark maintains perfect control over the 13-strong ensemble drawn from members of the company’s orchestra.The vocal lines in themselves are not especially characterful either. Unlike the much bigger works mentioned above, this is surely not one of Glass’s works destined to linger in the repertory.That said, not only the staging, to clear designs by Simon Banham atmospherically lit by Ace McCarron, but the individual performances maintain a high level. The evening’s doughty lynchpin is baritone Nicholas Lester as Josef K, but the other cast members, all of whom take two or three roles, make strong individual impressions."

Two – Humperdinck’s Hansel and Gretel and Rossini’s Cinderella – are familiar, but the first, despite its popularity with Russian audiences, hasn’t had a full-scale professional staging in the UK for 60 years.Here Rimsky-Korsakov’s allegory of barren winter giving way to fertile spring was sung in a fluent new English version by Alasdair Middleton.At heart the opera is a conventional if regularly charming and often beautifully scored piece of 19th-century folksiness, though nowadays not only commentators but also audiences expect the complexity and ambiguity of such tales to register more than in the past. So director John Fulljames and his design team (Giles Cadle’s adaptable set will be common to all three productions) reasonably place traditional visual elements within a modern setting: the village scenes centre on a clothing factory where the folk costumes and wedding dresses worn by many of the characters are made, while the visiting trader Mizgir in the original’s prehistoric setting becomes a trucker.It’s clever but nevertheless often uneasy, with some of the magic of the piece inevitably vanishing – except in Will Duke’s strikingly atmospheric videos. The most famous number in the opera – the rip-roaring Dance of the Tumblers – seems somewhat more prosaic when reduced to factory workers operating sewing machines.Strong individual performances add character. Irish soprano Aoife Miskelly brings sweetness and finesse to the Snow Maiden herself. James Creswell is firmly focused as Father Frost. Heather Lowe perfectly suggests the laddish cockiness of village heartthrob Lel, with Elin Pritchard appropriately volatile as Kupava, whom the Snow Maiden usurps in the affections of Phillip Rhodes’s ardent Mizgir. Bonaventura Bottone has some effortful moments as the benign Tsar Berendey. There’s committed work from both orchestra and chorus, though Leo McFall’s conducting could do with more brilliance."

With a cast lacking A-list stars and featuring three singers from the Royal Opera’s young artists scheme, it’s a gift to the finance department.But it’s also a delight for audiences. Bob Crowley’s plush sets – especially for the two party scenes, the former a grand, dome-ceilinged room with a huge bottle-cooler centrepiece, the latter a festival of gilt decoration – successfully convey the surroundings of the Parisian demi-monde. In Act III the formidable full-height blinds in Violetta’s room practically play a role in their own right. Daniele Rustioni conducts with constant sensitivity to mood and effect, right from the opening notes, leeched of colour, which reflect Violetta’s frailty.Violetta and Alfredo, the central couple, are both sung by Royal Opera debutants: both look fabulous, with Joyce El-Khoury having the wider range of dramatic expression, even if she needs more refinement, and (in Act I) agility, in the upper vocal reaches. In Act III her desperation to see Alfredo again and her decline from tuberculosis are touching. As Alfredo Sergey Romanovsky exudes confidence and wears his outfits well. There’s an attractive baritonal richness to his voice too. Pivotally, the chemistry between the pair is palpable.Polish baritone Artur Rucinski looks too young as Germont Senior and didn’t strike me as remarkable, though the audience received him with great enthusiasm.While not a white-hot re-igniting of this trusty production, it is one that is lovingly rewarmed."

What Sellars does not tell us, however, is that Ligeti (who died in 2006) was extremely unhappy with Sellars’ 1997 production; he even threatened to sue.Though it’s clearly not the same piece of work, there’s no doubt that by once again focusing throughout on the dire consequences of nuclear wars and nuclear accidents – there’s a visual history of nuclear explosions on a video map of the globe, while the Chernobyl disaster is referenced again and again – Sellars turns the absurdist original into something far darker and more menacing; real though Sellars’ concerns may be, Ligeti’s opera has been comprehensively re-angled to accommodate them.That said, and given the usual problems involved in trying to fit a 55-piece orchestra plus a limited staging onto the Barbican Hall’s none-too-ample platform – the highly disciplined chorus sings from various parts of the auditorium – this is a serious enterprise carried off with skill and musical precision. Rattle is in perfect control of one of the most significant scores of its period – now nearly forty years ago.The cast is admirable, with accomplished standouts from Peter Hoare’s Piet the Pot, Ronnita Miller’s vocally luscious Amando, Elizabeth Watt’s focused Amanda, Pavlo Hunka’s commanding Nekrotzar and Anthony Roth Costanzo’s flippant Prince Go-Go."

Here updated to the time of Der Rosenkavalier’s premiere (1911), just before the First World War, it’s not as romantic or nostalgic as usual. While Carsen lays a dogged stress on the period’s growing militarism, his insistence on labelling Faninal an arms dealer with a house full of cannon tendentiously pushes the text too far – it merely tells us that he supplies the army with something, which for all we know might be pyjamas.Elsewhere the sheer vastness of the set dwarfs the characters, who look like dolls in a doll’s house in Act 1, and in the wildly overpopulated upmarket brothel of Act 3, which replaces librettist Hugo von Hofmannsthal’s private room at an inn. Some of the intimacy of the piece goes missing, and with it its special magic.The first of two casts might have got closer to the heart of the matter in a less showy staging. Whether or not (as rumour has it) this will be Renee Fleming’s final appearances at the venue, her Marschallin looks and sounds nearly as good as when she last sang the role here sixteen years ago. Alice Coote sounds a lot less comfortable as Octavian, her tone too often raw. Sophie Bevan, meanwhile, proves a matchless Sophie.As Baron Ochs, Matthew Rose offers a scrupulously sung, amply voiced interpretation yet seems reluctant to portray the dark side of the opera’s brutish comic villain. Jochen Schmeckenbecher makes an enthusiastic Faninal and as the Italian Singer Giorgio Berrugi gives notice of a fine tenor. Conductor Andris Nelsons sounds entirely in his element in Strauss’ lavish score and the orchestra plays well for him."

Sombre and powerful, it’s a tour de force for its sole performer, the 25-year-old soprano Héloïse Werner, a rising figure on the contemporary music scene.The opera is divided into three parts: the end of the universe, of humanity, and finally, of an individual. Werner fearlessly takes a deep dive into this turbulent sea of emotions. With only a chair, a piano bench and a few other props, and accompanying herself with wooden claves and a bell, she makes great use of her considerable vocal and acting range, portraying a spectrum of emotions as her character grapples with imminent endings. Credit must go to director Emily Burns for fine-tuning Werner’s dramatic persona.Both the music and the libretto come from one of Werner’s regular collaborators, Jonathan Woolgar, who was BBC Young Composer 2010. Like the soprano Cathy Berberian, whose vocal acrobatics and theatrical prowess fascinated Luciano Berio, Werner must have been a pleasure to write for. Woolgar presumably also provided the pithy titles and the sometimes distracting quotes from poems that are projected against a wall behind the performer.Scenes from the End is at the Tristan Bates Theatre for six performances on the heels of well-received appearances at this year’s Camden and Edinburgh festivals, and it might be the ideal bleak midwinter moment for many."

The main reason for this is surely its lack of emotional depth: it’s hard to sympathise with such two-dimensional characters, a problem that is not solved by David Bosch’s production, returning to the Royal Opera House for the first time since its July premiere. Nonetheless, the chance to experience the work on stage is welcome, and this atmospheric modern-day take offers much to enjoy, including an imposing on-stage tank and lively gypsy camp scene.Although not a stellar cast, all the principals hold their own. Most impressive is Georgian mezzo Anita Rachvelishvili, terrifying as gypsy woman Azucena with blood-curdling low notes and a searing upper range. Uzbek tenor Najmiddin Mavlyanov has power and fluidity as titular troubadour Manrico, while his lover, Italian soprano Maria Agresta, has tonal beauty but insufficient strength; neither exudes much dramatic flair.As military leader Count di Luna, Hawaiian baritone Quinn Kelsey is admirably cavernous, albeit with occasional cracks, but surely star Dmitri Hvorostovsky will make more of the role when he joins the cast for the show’s second return in February. Richard Farnes, fresh from stepping down as music director of Opera North, conducts with energy but doesn’t bring a distinctively Italianate quality to the music."

It’s a safe bet that its successor – which premiered under Thomas Ades in LA just a week ago, before transferring in concert to the Barbican with many of the same performers – will enjoy a similar success.Now in his early 60s, Barry has written half a dozen operas, to increasing acclaim. His is a highly individual voice in contemporary music; indeed one might describe his style as quirky, founded on simple ideas – scales and arpeggios are much in evidence – and repetition, though his music has nothing to do with minimalism. Especially in a comic piece such as Alice, the result is genuinely funny as well as easy to assimilate; at its best, his originality amounts to genius.Those who enjoyed Earnest will also like Alice, and indeed there’s a slight danger of Barry using identical methods to gain his once more witty ends. But wit there certainly is aplenty in a piece that addresses Lewis Carroll’s Alice books in a style unlike that of any other composer. Given the number of leading lights from British opera companies in the audience, it surely won’t be long before we experience a full staging.The cast could hardly be bettered. As Alice, Barbara Hannigan immediately rises to nigh-on incredible coloratura soprano heights, and then stays up there. Contralto Hilary Summers is resplendent as the White Queen, regally matched by Allison Cook as her Red Queen colleague. Singing multiple roles, Allan Clayton, Peter Tantsits, Mark Stone and Joshua Bloom offer equally remarkable performances, while Ades draws an uproarious account of the score from the expert Britten Sinfonia."

A collaboration between Hungarian composer Peter Eotvos and his friend the writer Peter Esterhazy, it is both waywardly disparate and yet intensely coherent.It’s named for the medieval monk Notker Balbulus – Notker the Stammerer. A narrator introduces himself and his two colleagues, flawed from the get-go: a stuttering Prophet (sung by Finnish tenor Topi Lehtipuu) and a wine-loving Angel (she once got drunk with Nietzsche, she tells us). As well as adding occasional commentary, the chorus interjects with a variety of Hallelujahs – prompting musical quotations from Handel’s Messiah, as well as from Monteverdi, Bach, Mussorgsky and others. The text is replete with contradiction and obfuscation, heavy on juxtaposition, self-referential, switching from the existential to prosaic.Likewise Eotvos explores the higher register of the tenor and the lower of the mezzo. Music and text come together to form a parody that appears disparately incoherent which yet appears to distil unswervingly down to a single message: that now, of all times, we cannot see our future – a message the more sharply pointed following Esterhazy’s death this summer from pancreatic cancer. Topi Lehtipuu played the unknowing Prophet with the air of a holy fool and Iris Vermillion was in commanding voice, occasionally drawing in the atmosphere of smoke-filled cabaret.The remainder of the concert featured two premieres from the VIenna Philharmonic’s less recent history: Schoenberg’s Friede auf Erden warmly sung by the Hungarian Choir (the 1911 premiere included string-orchestra accompaniment) and the Adagio of Mahler’s incomplete Tenth Symphony, amply showcasing the sweet orchestra’s unique sweet halo of strings and its radiant brass. "

Every shift of mood and every streak of colouring is mined for full dramatic impact. It goes without saying these days that few conductors have such an affinity with Puccini, but this makes each achievement no less remarkable.Jonathan Kent’s lascivious production, revived by Paul Higgins, updates the action to the present. In Act II, Manon – by now a young mistress to the older Geronte – is in Kent’s eyes a stay-at-home sex kitten, who is pleasured by the singing madrigalist and whose own minuet dance becomes a videographed soft porn show, watched by a row of bald men. In Act III the prostitutes awaiting deportation are re-exploited in a nearby brothel and the crowd gathered to witness their removal becomes the studio audience of some cruel reality TV show. All this is paraded in such vivid stage and costume designs that it’s often difficult to see beyond what seems like the production’s own misogyny into the world of sexual exploitation it might seem to reveal.Sondra Radvanovsky doesn’t always appear comfortable in her writhing and grinding but brings a warmer than usual, mezzo-like quality to the title role. Latvian tenor Aleksandrs Antonenko has vocal flair and colour but his acting is less nuanced. Eric Halvarson and Levente Molnar give gratifyingly rounded performances as Geronte and Manon’s brother respectively.Find tickets for Manon Lescaut on The Stage Tickets  "

Under artistic director Oliver Mears, the company has acquired a reputation for artistic daring and innovation.In his final production before taking over as director of opera at the Royal Opera House, Mears cuts loose with characteristic brio on a stylish, swaggering production of Don Giovanni. Without pausing to ponder its contested definition as tragedy or comedy, Mears has opted for both. In amongst the rampant womanising and blokeish carry-on with John Molloy’s engaging Leporello, Henk Neven’ blonde, coolly fashionable seducer is a deeply flawed character, exploitative, ruthless, misogynistic, predatory.The mischievous topical parallel is pushed further when Leporello’s disguise is topped by a caramel coloured, bouffant wig. Aboard an ocean liner, class and gender politics slot in beside a bonanza of sex, drugs and rock’n’roll as Annemarie Woods’ beautifully lit sets segue between sun deck, restaurant, cocktail bar, cabin corridor and water-filled swimming pool, where the world’s greatest philanderer will meet a hilariously shocking end.The performances of cast and chorus are crisp and witty but although the opera is sung in English, diction is not always as clear as one would wish. South Korean Hye-Youn Lee’s stately Donna Anna is nicely partnered by Sam Furness’s nerdy Don Ottavio.  But the evening belongs to Northern Ireland soprano Aoife Miskelly, fizzing and sparkling as a pert, sexy Zerlina, even in the slightly queasy aria where she begs to be punished violently for her dalliance with the dastardly Don."

Both are achieved by the company’s latest venture, Mozart’s The Magic Flute, staged in the well-appointed studio space of Jacksons Lane Theatre, Highgate. But its aspiration to offer high quality productions is, unfortunately, less successful.The young cast displays respectable vocal talent (most impressive are the Three Ladies – Rebekah Smith, Caroline Daggett and Stephanie Wake-Edwards), but acting skills need rather more development.In this, the fledgling artists are not helped by Toria Banks’ unfocused, laissez-faire production. The concept has promise – the strange world to which medieval crusader Tamino finds himself transported is a modern-day England run by bewigged judges (Sarastro), tweed-and-gown academics (Speaker) and stern office managers (Queen of the Night) – but the realisation is half-hearted and the action often painfully pedestrian.The strong comic potential in re-imagining bird-catcher Papageno as a gangly office nerd, for example, is wasted with a portrayal so understated as to be mortifyingly awkward – for the wrong reasons. The welcome flash of life when Monastatos and his cronies break into a spell-induced tap routine highlights the general lack of energy and conviction.The score is performed essentially complete, competently conducted – with a 12-piece orchestra – by Christopher Stark; thankfully, much of the spoken dialogue is cut.By amateur or student standards, this is a decent effort. But there is no reason why HGO shouldn’t compete with companies such as PopUp Opera or OperaUpClose, small companies that centre around emerging talent, but which also hold their own in the professional arena."

A rarely performed piece, Handel’s 1734 Oreste consists of arias from other works assembled in a new dramatic context: Handel’s contemporaries would have called the result a ‘pasticcio’ – Italian for a pie or a mess.The ultimate source is Euripides’ Iphigenia in Tauris, and given the nature of the original myth, with its ongoing acts of slaughter, blood sacrifice and revenge, one can hardly fault Gerard Jones’ staging for representing the violence inherent in the plot and its background.Jones co-designs the show with artist Matt Carter. Their straightforward set is covered with urban art, including a portrait of local king Toante, a genial psychopath dressed in idiosyncratic uniform, who has all foreign visitors to his kingdom sacrificed. Through a window in the back of the set, we see Diana’s priestess – an unwilling Ifigenia – bludgeon an unknown victim to death during the overture. Throughout there’s an emphasis on mistreatment, torture and violence.Where Jones goes too far is in the constant tics and twitches with which his often crazed characters are over-liberally endowed: in this instance, the result demonstrates the law of diminishing returns, but there’s no denying the effort put in by the cast to realise the director’s intentions.High vocal standards, from Angela Simkin’s psychologically damaged Oreste, Jennifer Davis’s reluctant executioner Ifigenia, Thomas Atkin’s vividly sung Pilade, Vlada Borovko’s spirited Ermione, Simon Shibambu’s grand-scale Toante and with Gyula Nagy an increasingly lairy Filotete – a contralto role transposed for baritone. James Hendry is the expert conductor of 10 alert members of the Southbank Sinfonia."

Karl Amadeus Hartmann lived through the Nazi period by adopting what has been described as an attitude of ‘inner emigration’ – he forbade performances of his works in Germany during the Third Reich, only allowing them to be heard abroad. He wrote just one substantial opera, which exists in two versions, and in its first UK production Independent Opera offers a blend of the two.Composed in 1934-5, the piece is based on a 17th-century German novel set during the Thirty Years War, which devastated the country and saw millions of civilians die through military campaigns inspired by religious zealotry.The central character is a boy who doesn’t know his own name, but is christened Simpleton of All Simpletons by a hermit he encounters on his travels through a nightmare world of random violence, cruelty and destruction.Essentially a sequence of episodes without much sense of structure, it is awkwardly shaped, while Hartmann’s truculent, neo-classically influenced score – skilfully performed here by the Britten Sinfonia under the baton of Timothy Redmond – is only intermittently worthwhile.To director Polly Graham falls the task of making the result cohere on stage, and though the blend of appalling brutality and the comic-grotesque also present in David Pountney’s translation is an uneasy mix, descending into self-parody on more than one occasion, she does a creditable job, as does her hardworking cast and her designer Nate Gibson.Linchpin of the show is Stephanie Corley’s Simplicius, an energetic performance that never quite convinces you that the protagonist is a male, while among a committed company there are standouts from Adrian Thompson’s Hermit, Mark Le Brocq’s Governor and William Dazeley’s Soldier."

ENO has presented the piece just once before: Richard Jones’ staging was a significant success back in 2002, though it received just one revival three years later.The new show is the work of the acclaimed South African visual artist and animated filmmaker William Kentridge, first presented in Amsterdam in June 2015 and repeated at the New York Met last November; ENO’s distinguished former music director Mark Wigglesworth returns to conduct. One important carry-over from the 2002 version is Richard Stokes’s skilful English translation.Setting Berg’s own libretto derived from Frank Wedekind’s plays Earth Spirt and Pandora’s Box, the score is written in the 12-note style, often regarded as forbidding, but which Berg handles with such flexibility and resource that the result packs a powerful emotional punch despite its complexity; but it still demands the highest standards of musicianship from a large cast, and it’s good to hear ENO’s orchestra on superb form throughout, with Wigglesworth’s ear for intricate detail ensuring a consistently fascinating listen.For his part, Kentridge’s staging makes continuous use of his trademark animations and projections. Pages of a dictionary form a regular background, alongside the artist’s own drawings – mainly of men, many of them famous; but there are others that represent Lulu herself.Itself non-stop in its visual imagery, and forming a hyperactive backdrop to the characters and their tragi-comic, invariably sexually motivated relationships, Kentridge’s designs stop short of drowning out the rest of the show – though at times it’s a pretty close call.Sabine Theunissen’s sets and Greta Goiris’ costumes evoke the period of the work’s composition and posthumous premiere in 1937. As well as the standard cast, Kentridge introduces two silent extra figures – an omnipresent female mannequin played by Joanna Dudley and presumably representing Lulu’s spirit, and a valet-like male figure cleverly acted by Andrea Fabi.Individual sung performances are generally strong, with Brenda Rae reaching all the high notes as Lulu while suggesting her character’s sexual magnetism, with its appeal to men and women alike. Nicky Spence makes a fluent, flawlessly articulate Alwa, and Sarah Connolly’s lush mezzo helps make lovelorn Countess Geschwitz’s plight genuinely involving.Willard White is a lived-in Schigolch, while Jeffrey Lloyd Roberts offers fine studies of the Prince, Manservant and Marquis to match David Soar’s overweening Animal Tamer and Athlete, Clare Presland’s comprehensively excellent tripling up of the Theatrical Dresser, the Schoolboy and the Waiter, and also Michael Colvin’s Painter and Second Client. But James Morris sounds vocally worn as Dr Schon, and offers no sinister quality as Jack the Ripper, while unlike Rae he doesn’t mask a strong American accent."

The film director himself – whose first opera this was back in 1980 – died in 2003, the show’s costume designer, Maria Bjornson, the previous year. It’s hardly the fault of revival director Daniel Dooner that visually there’s a tired air to proceedings: it’s time for a replacement.That said, elements of the show go well, despite routine conducting from Evelino Pido that on numerous occasions lacks clarity of ensemble. The hardworking Royal Opera Chorus, however, are on vigorous form.What will linger in the memory from this revival are some fine individual performances and some excellent singing. Vittorio Grigolo throws himself gamely into the title role, singing and acting with commitment as the self-destructive, alcoholic writer. Though his switch back and forth from the raddled drunk of the prologue and epilogue to the romantic hero of the three tales involves some long pauses – and those big old sets cannot be easy to move either – he proves a striking exponent of the arduous title role.American mezzo Kate Lindsey nevertheless comes close to stealing the show from him with her flawlessly sung, immaculately observed double role as Hoffmann’s young amanuensis Nicklausse and his protective Muse.Both Christine Rice’s lusciously sung courtesan Giulietta and Sonya Yoncheva’s grandly vocalised but doomed singer Antonia hold the attention, though Sofia Fomina needs more vocal and physical precision as the doll Olympia.Christophe Mortagne offers a neat comic-grotesque vignette as Olympia’s creator Spalanzani, while Vincent Ordonneau’s quadrupling up in the four servant roles is consistently clever. Thomas Hampson’s four villains, however, shows his voice in decline and his acting hammy, while Eric Halfvarson disappoints as Antonia’s father, Crespel."

The literal story is of a woman who wanders through a moonlit forest in search of her unfaithful lover and comes upon his dead body, but there are many psychological strata below. These are successfully unearthed by the mesmerising soprano Madeleine Pierard, ably assisted by a non-speaking Simeon John-Wake as her lover, alive and dead.If Erwartung, from 1909, is the quintessence of Expressionism, Twice Through the Heart (1994-96) is more Impressionist, with vignettes by poet Jackie Kay examining the thoughts of a woman who stabbed her abusive husband to death. Kate Howden brings much power to bear on the role’s dramatic and vocal demands, but placed against a masterpiece like the Erwartung, the limitations of Turnage’s musical ideas are all too evident.At the Hackney Showroom, the orchestra, excellently directed by Finnegan Downie Dear, takes up one-third of the room, while the rubber gravel coated stage occupies a much smaller area, raising fears that the performers might fall into the audience.Shadwell Opera deserves praise for its innovative programming and ideas, including artist Sergei Zinchuk’s post-interval ‘intervention’ guiding the audience in a spontaneous construction project with plywood sticks."

This year, collaborating with the same costume designer, Giuseppe Palella, and set designer Gary McCann, his production of a work that has similarities in the extravagance of its melodrama flops from a visual point of view – though musically things are a definite success.
Originally set in Switzerland around 1400, Maria de Rudenz is a work dating from the middle years of Donizetti’s career that is packed with violent incident, its characters trailing a complex back-history. Above all else, its narrative needs absolute clarity in the telling.Moving the action forward to the period of composition, Ceresa and his team fill the stage up with all sorts of unnecessary contrivance that clogs up the piece’s dramatic wheels. McCann’s set is enormous and cumbersome, a multi-level structure whose individual sections must be a nightmare to move around on the Wexford stage, and in whose multiple rooms there is far too much extraneous activity. There is an obsessive amount of weird headgear worn by all the characters, especially the chorus, while someone should discretely dispose of the characters’ puppet doubles.A shame, because the piece possesses real power and the cast is well up to performing it. Italian soprano Gilda Fiume flaunts a comprehensively excellent technique in delineating the tormented trajectory of the betrayed, vengeful Maria. Korean baritone Joo Won Kang is consistently exciting as Corrado, the man who wrongs her. As his supposed brother Enrico, American tenor Jesus Garcia offers shapely lyricism, while Georgian soprano Sophie Gordeladze fleshes out what there is of the limited role of Maria’s cousin and doomed rival Matilde.In the pit conductor, meanwhile, Andrew Greenwood leads a performance charged with stylistic expertise and musical authority."

In the case of this year’s season opener, Felicien David’s 1859 grand opera Herculanum, it has its work cut out.At its Parisian premiere it was clearly the sheer spectacle of the piece – which ends with the ancient Roman town and all contained therein being obliterated by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD79 – that thrilled audiences.The Paris Opera budget for such things in 1859 was enormous, and while director Stephen Medcalf and his design team give this calamitous occurrence a decent shot, it’s not quite the stonking cataclysm that these days Hollywood’s CGI technicians do better.Elsewhere Jamie Vartan’s Empire-style costumes help create some fine stage pictures for the decadent Roman court, where the wicked seductress Olympia and her even more wicked brother Nicanor attempt to seduce persecuted Christians Helios and Lilia, with mixed results: when the menacing Nicanor tells Lilia that her God cannot save her because he doesn’t exist, he is struck by lightning. Here, she hits him over the head with a rock. Either way, Satan instantly springs up in his place.The problem is that despite lively work from Wexford’s chorus and orchestra under conductor Jean-Luc Tingaud, David’s competent yet ordinary score fails to maximise the drama of such scenes.Where Wexford does gain ground is in its rewarding casting. Romanian Olga Busuioc gives eloquent voice to Lilia’s desperation, while Daniela Pini gloats triumphantly as the unscrupulous Olympia. Best of all is the graceful tenor of Canadian Andrew Haji as vacillating Helios, while Simon Bailey’s Nicanor/Satan seizes such devilish opportunities as are granted by the composer – though several of David’s French contemporaries would have offered him far more."

Thus far, no major company in the UK has staged it.The current Wexford revival offers a good chance for reassessment, and though doubts must remain about the work’s viability, the festival brings solid dramatic and musical values to bear on it in this beautifully realised staging by Rodula Gaitanou skilfully conducted by Timothy Myers.Set in some undefined northern country around 1905 (though Gaitanou and her accomplished designer Cordelia Chisholm bring the period forward to that of the work’s composition), Vanessa shows Anatol, a young male visitor, altering the lives of a household of aristocratic women with his blend of personal attraction and cynicism.The lean narrative leaves gaps in our knowledge of the characters and their pasts. In this house of secrets, is Erika really Vanessa’s niece, or her daughter by Anatol’s father, and thus his half-sister? Menotti’s sometimes stilted use of language makes the whole piece seem more artificial than it might be.Barber’s score, too, is uneven, its mixture of late-Romantic lyricism (think Puccini or Strauss) and modernist spikiness (think Berg or Britten) not entirely convincing; but technically it is finely put together, and the closing scene possesses real eloquence.So, too, do the central performances, with soprano Claire Rutter embodying Vanessa’s vanity and vulnerability, mezzo Carolyn Sproule channelling Erika’s combination of fragility and strength, and tenor Michael Brandenburg effortlessly suggesting Anatol’s facile if phoney charm. Stealing several scenes, however, is mezzo Rosalind Plowright as the stiff-backed, taciturn Old Baroness, a role she plays to perfection."

The first of such partnerships, this production of The Magic Flute arrives from Hungary’s Szeged National Theatre, winner of the 2015 Armel Opera Festival in Budapest.Mozart’s final opera is full of sublime music, but the libretto, by the composer’s friend Emanuel Schikaneder, is no masterpiece – inconsistent bordering on incoherent, with outdated attitudes towards women and people of colour. So, it’s by no means a ridiculous premise to embrace its madness, as director Robert Alfoldi does, setting the opera within a grubbily-tiled mental institution.The young heroes Tamino, Pamina and Papageno – who, naturally, believes he is a bird – are inmates, kept in check by white-coated warders lead by a demented disco-channelling Queen of the Night – a remarkable performance by Marlene Assayag.Fortunately the production turns out to be much less grim than the unpleasant, noisy antics during the overture suggest – new inmate Tamino being beaten into submission while he grapples with a hosepipe ‘snake’ unnecessarily spoils the music, revealing nothing that wouldn’t have been immediately obvious at the start of the opera proper – its general tone being sweet, humorous and charming, albeit sometimes naive. It’s impossible not to smile, for example, at the delightfully silly spectacle of prancing inmates and warders – the ‘wild creatures’ that Tamino tames with his ‘magic flute’, here a red straw.The vocal standard of the principals is high and, though the significantly more mature chorus is underpowered, it’s a treat to hear a full orchestra in the pit doing Mozart’s wonderful score justice."

His Covent Garden debut comes with the company’s first ever production of Shostakovich’s absurdist comedy The Nose, written when the Russian composer was just 21.It tells a bizarre tale about a civil servant called Kovalov, who wakes up one morning to discover that his nose is missing and who spends the rest of the three-act opera – played here without an interval – haring around St Petersburg trying to locate it.The Nose itself, meanwhile – performed by dancer Ilan Galkoff – engages in adventures of its own before the two are eventually reunited.The tone is necessarily comic-grotesque, and Shostakovich must have had fun writing a large-scale score that is noisy, abrasive and which breaks all the rules: musical highlights include an interlude for percussion only. That said, and despite Kosky’s assertion that “the piece is about fear and loss and paranoia, about body parts and sexuality and castration”, it’s hard to engage with other than on the level of an extended joke.Kosky and his design team, however, come up with enough visual invention to keep you happy for a couple of outlandishly colourful hours. A ballet of 11 tap-dancing noses – even if not envisaged by the composer – proves an unforgettable image.The cast is tireless and often memorable, with the nervous tics of Martin Winkler’s Kovalov, John Tomlinson’s versatile tripling up as the Barber, Newspaper Office Clerk and the Doctor, and Wolfgang Ablinger-Sperrhacke’s irrepressibly funny Servant, as well as the four other small parts he takes on (there are 77 in all) registering with particular success.But everyone has a ball in this fast and furious entertainment, vigorously conducted by Ingo Metzmacher and wisely sung in a clever English translation courtesy of David Pountney."

Updating the setting from ‘Ceylon, in ancient times’ to an unspecified modern era reaps some rewards in Penny Woolcock’s 2010 production, now in its second revival at ENO.Dick Bird’s sets establish the sombre mood, notably an eye-catching tableau of diving pearl fishers, an ochre-toned shanty town and a grey, file-covered office. Equally affecting, though overlong, are video projections, by 59 Productions, of tsunami devastation.With such formidable sets, less proves to be more for the performers. The opening crowded ensemble scene, for example, is curiously static until the famous duet between Nadir, a pearl diver, and Zurga, the village ruler, who set aside their rivalry for the beautiful priestess Leila in favour of friendship.The warm baritone of Jacques Imbrailo, making his ENO debut as Zurga, is its most expressive in his anguished encounter with Leila in the third act. There’s vocal confidence also from Claudia Boyle as Leïla, though she’s less secure in her high range; likewise, Nadir (Robert McPherson) struggles for focus in the heights. The High Priest Nourabad is reliably portrayed by James Creswell. Some too-slow tempos from Roland Böer conducting the ENO orchestra curtail the musical momentum at times.On opening night, the final scene’s solemnity was undermined when stage and the pit were filled with smoke, entirely obscuring Zurga in his act of noble self-sacrifice."

Yet it is remarkable how successful Williams, in particular, is in suggesting a creature whose physical and moral beauty have about them a touch of the divine; a composer himself, he sings Britten’s notes with a clear understanding of why each and every one of them matters.Miles, too, conveys much of the inner darkness of Claggart, whose self-loathing causes him to destroy the being who has caused him to feel – perhaps for the very first time – a kind of love.In between these two stands Oke’s expertly sung Vere, blessed by Billy even as he watches his execution – a death he could have stepped in to prevent. The character’s unfathomable decision is exposed for us to solve – if we can.Around these three performances Opera North has mustered a first-rate supporting crew, who come together in the grandest gestures of Britten’s choral writing, flooding the theatre with sound, while conductor Garry Walker has the measure of the smallest details as well as the overall scope of the score."

Boys of Paradise is an immersive opera set in a gay nightclub and performed at the Egg London club, north of King’s Cross.The neat transition as the live six-piece instrumental ensemble takes over from the PA system is a long time coming, but when the main characters emerge it’s a relief to see some action. Dominic Kimberlin’s libretto is racy and edgy in places – what’s the point of drugs, we hear, when there’s no “young arse to snort it off.” But the narrative arc – concerning the journey of the newbie pretty boy Twink, who finds that free drinks, drugs and sex come easy – staggers around in its own state of semi-consciousness.Twink’s starting point of low-self-esteem is clear enough: “Outside I’m nothing; in here I’m drink-worthy”. But his transformation, apparently inspired by the idea of a phoenix rising from the ashes, is only weakly suggested before the show’s abrupt end.The transgender nightclub owner Peregrine (with avian headdress to match), sung by counter-tenor Iestyn Morris, is the only other character of note, save for the Fag Hag, who has a half-poignant, half-comic soliloquy on her social role and its disadvantages: “You’re not the one they want to fuck”.While the singing all round is of a good standard, Vahan Salorian’s music, though neatly cut, too often feels like off-the-peg musical theatre fodder – a feature keenly at odds with the remainder of this supposedly gritty and innovative experience."

Traditional without being old-fashioned, Simon Higlett’s clever and towering design is harmoniously lit by Mark Jonathan. There is a drive and verve from the pit, where Tobias Ringborg has the Orchestra of Scottish Opera shimmering.The dust of harvest floats across the bucolic opening, with peasants rolling around behind sheafs of corn. Allen quickly betrays a lack of attention to the details of the background performances in favour of broad strokes from his principals – this favouring of broadness over subtlety is one of the production’s least attractive traits.Anna Devin’s Susanna is the stand-out performance. Bright of voice and quick of intellect, Devin owns Act I when Susanna is confronted with a succession of unwanted visitor’s to her future bed-chamber. Against her clarity, Ben McAteer’s Figaro is solid, both in voice and acting performance. Samuel Dale Johnson’s count possesses the necessary magnetism, although his voice is not always as strong as his lustful urges.It’s in the Countess Almaviva – who Eleanor Dennis gives a fine sense of the loneliness of one loved, scorned and betrayed – that this sets its intellectual mettle. Defined by her childlessness when a ghostly infant walks across her room in her opening aria, she gives the opera its final twist when, having seemingly put the issue of infidelity to bed, she embraces it again by foisting a final ribbon on Hanna Hipp’s ultra-randy (and gorgeously sung) Cherubino. "

Maybe they’ll firm up as the tour proceeds.Designer Takis creates a simple set comprising to one side bows that prefigure the opera’s most famous scene – when Penelope’s suitors fail to string the bow of Ulysses, while the returning but disguised warrior himself succeeds in doing so before slaughtering them – and on the other a simple wall that provides entrances and exits.It’s a long piece, and despite conductor Jonathan Peter Kenny keeping the Old Street Band in the pit effectively on the move there’s not enough dramatic impetus at times; but there’s a sense of period style in the music-making and some strong vocal performances standing out from a variable cast.Benedict Nelson emphatically holds the stage as Ulysses, embodying his suffering and flawed nobility in a performance of grandeur and strength. Nick Pritchard is vital as his son Telemachus. Andrew Slater’s tripling up of Time, Neptune and Antinous needs more resonance lower down.But Carolyn Dobbin’s Penelope suggests the stoicism of Ulysses’ faithful wife and Katie Bray’s Minerva offers dignity and rich tone."
228,"La Calisto review at Hackney Empire, London – ‘stylish period music-making’",https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2016/la-calisto-review-at-hackney-empire-london/,La Calisto,Hackney Empire,London,3,2016-10-17,George Hall,"Venetian opera is the theme of English Touring Opera’s autumn jaunt around eight venues, launching as usual at the Hackney Empire. Monteverdi’s pupil Cavalli is represented by what is surely his best known piece, La Calisto, first staged in La Serenissima in 1651.It’s a mythological sex-comedy, in which Jupiter seduces the nymph Calisto disguised as Diana, to the fury of his wife Juno. Director Timothy Nelson – who also conducts his own edition of the score, sung in a translation for which he is partially credited – aims on the low side in comedic terms. The result shows a cast working just that bit too hard to gain their laughs.Some of the sophistication of the piece, and certainly its elements of pathos and lyric beauty, are apt to go missing in a production that veers all too frequently towards the level of Carry On Calisto.The musical side, for which the multi-talented Nelson is also responsible, is surer-footed, with the Old Street Band in the pit supplying a small instrumental ensemble eminently suited to the task, give or take a couple of recorders. Though Nelson manages the pacing well, the show still feels about 10 minutes too long.But there’s some fine singing, especially from Paula Sides’ Calisto, a role to which she brings enriched lyricism, from Catherine Carby’s doughty Diana, and from Susanna Fairbairn’s angry Juno.Even more than the women, the male characters tend to descend into caricature rather than retaining their comedic humanity, though George Humphreys makes an appreciable impact both as Jove and as Jove disguised as Diana, while Nick Pritchard is a sparky Mercury; but Tai Oney’s beautifully sung Endimione suffers more than most from the comic-grotesque approach.Mechanically oriented designs by Takis are clever but fussy, and on the whole tend to get in the way."

Its central character Asad, a refugee from war-torn Somalia, makes his journey across the continent to reach South Africa, where his situation is in some respects scarcely better than where he started off. By the interval he has arrived in what he hopes might be a promised land, yet the prejudice and violence he encounters in his new environment mean that this is far from being simply a feel-good show.Yet in many ways it’s a genuinely inspiring one, testifying to the potential for goodness within the human spirit even as it shows us the worst that people can do to one another. Asad’s journey is equally an eternally relevant reminder of what some of the refugees we see on news bulletins every day are endeavouring to escape.As he grows from an eight-year-old boy to a young man through the course of the piece, Asad is played by a sequence of performers – all excellent. But while there are undoubted standouts in this part-adventure story, part-moral fable, it’s the quality of the 24-strong company as a whole that ultimately impresses most. They can act, they can dance, they take turns as the orchestra – seven marimbas, some drums, feet and voices – and their singing is of outstanding quality. No microphones are needed, and when they combine into a chorus, the result is magnificent. Clearly operatic in its musical and vocal ambition, the result will linger long in the memory."
230,The Knife of Dawn review at the Roundhouse – ‘intense and atmospheric’,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2016/the-knife-of-dawn-review-at-the-roundhouse/,The Knife of Dawn,the Roundhouse – ‘intense and atmospheric’,The Knife of Dawn review at the Roundhouse,3,2016-10-07,Edward Bhesania,"Mounted as part of Black History Month, The Knife of Dawn is a one-man chamber opera featuring American baritone Eric Greene as the Guyanese poet and political activist Martin Carter.Carter’s collection Poems of Resistance from British Guiana was published in 1954 between his two spells in prison under the British government.Greene squarely carries the drama, mostly seated or slumped on the floor of his cell during his hunger strike. His only company are the noises and voices in his head – the latter including his wife, his as yet unborn daughter and his own wavering thoughts – articulated by the vocal trio Juice. Greene inhabits the relatively compact space to draw in the audience in the most interior moments, while also impressing with his rich, engulfing tone. It’s a portrait of an ordinary, idealistic man, firm in his beliefs, but often unsure of the efficacy of his actions. His self-questioning, “What does a poet know about politics?” is only partly assuaged by the inner-voice reply “Starvation will be your greatest poem yet.”Composer Hannah Kendall marshals her instrumental forces – a string trio plus harp – with assured restraint. From the opening plucked raindrops onwards, the players never overpower the singer, always steering a clear path between descriptive foreground and recessive backdrop. The vocal writing is equally naturalistic and well-judged. The occasional brave pause for silence – one as Carter falls asleep – adds to the atmospheric dimension.Despite Rebecca Miller’s keenly focused conducting, there’s a sense in which the relatively static drama and music don’t quite sustain the work’s 60-minute length. Or maybe, like, Carter, we just need patience."
231,ENO Tosca review at the London Coliseum – ‘fine work’,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2016/english-national-operas-tosca-review-at-the-london-coliseum-fine-work/,ENO Tosca,the London Coliseum – ‘fine work’,ENO Tosca review at the London Coliseum,4,2016-10-04,Inge Kjemtrup,"Evil can take many forms, and in opera, there are few characters that embody evil more unambiguously than the police chief Scarpia in Puccini’s Tosca. In English National Opera’s version (directed by Catherine Malfitano in the original 2010 production and Donna Stirrup for this revival), Scarpia is not the typical heavyweight tough guy of advancing years, but is instead a younger, sharply dressed power broker, forever snapping his fingers at minions. Craig Colclough’s excellent characterisation makes Scarpia’s menacing of the hapless Tosca more sinister than usual. This is a man who would happily eat his meal while torture goes on in the next room.The danger for any Tosca is being overshadowed by Scarpia’s mesmerising malevolence. American Keri Alkema, making her London debut, rises to the challenge. She has a strong stage presence and warm soprano, although her diction isn’t always as clear as that of her male colleagues, including Gwyn Hughes Jones as Cavaradossi. If there’s no palpable attraction between Alkema and Jones as the doomed couple, there are many fine musical moments, not least Tosca’s Life Has Taught Me Singing and Loving, sung in a spotlight as Scarpia lurks behind her, and Cavaradossi’s All the Stars Shone in Heaven, staged against the dramatic battlements of Castel Sant’Angelo (the dramatic curved set is by Frank Philipp Schlossmann).There is fine work in smaller roles from Adrian Powter in the comically pious Sacristan, Andri Bjorn Robertsson as the suffering Angelotti and Robert Winslade Anderson as a fair-minded gaoler. Under the direction of Oleg Caetani, the ENO orchestra brings a burnished tone to Puccini’s rich score."

With playing of this calibre, ENO’s musicians sound like the finest opera orchestra in the country. Tempo choices all worked perfectly too.Nicky Gillibrand’s costumes suggest something like 1950s Spain. Paul Steinberg’s sets are concerned above all with doors. Apart from a couple of beds – one for Don Giovanni and Donna Anna in the opening scene, for instance, plus another for her father the Commendatore and his partner across the hall – the visuals focus almost entirely on characterless rooms and drab corridors with various doors leading off them.Sometimes these open to reveal books – multiple copies of Leporello’s catalogue of his boss’ conquests – but elsewhere they are portals leading to some unseen sexual connection: in the overture, for instance, a succession of women (plus one man) slip round Leporello to briefly enter a door with Giovanni before emerging and slipping away again.The brutality and violence inherent in the piece is not shirked. Giovanni and Anna share some dangerous sexual fantasy game which – disturbingly – involves a knife. Masetto’s anger with Zerlina is borderline terrifying. Giovanni’s lack of conscience is as apparent in his physical violence as in his instant seductions followed by just walking away.The production is uniformly well acted, but crucially Jones never forgets that this is essentially a comic opera – and not just nominally so. I’m not going to give away the final twist, but it’s as clever and thought-provoking as all the rest.This is an evening of high vocal standards, too, matching the fine acting performances. Christopher Purves is a mature Giovanni and sometimes underpowered, but you can understand his fatal fascination; his double act with Clive Bayley’s leering Leporello is faultless. Caitlin Lynch offers Donna Anna some real vocal personality. Allan Clayton’s high-definition tenor makes Don Ottavio unusually memorable. Christine Rice is consistently striking as a perpetually troubled Donna Elvira, though the role lies high for her. Nicholas Crawley makes his mark as an unstable Masetto, while Mary Bevan’s Zerlina is sung with pristine precision and James Creswell’s Commendatore possesses absolute vocal authority."

Spoken dialogue alternates with arias accompanied by an orchestra led by a bamboo flute player, while drum and percussion comment on the characters’ physical movements.Tang’s The Handan Dream provides the central narrative. The peasant Lu Sheng tells an innkeeper of his frustrations over his lowly lot, and the innkeeper, secretly an immortal being, gives Lu Sheng the gift – or curse – of experiencing his longed-for high-status life in a dream.Co-directors Ke Jun (a leading figure in the world of Kunqu) and Leon Rubin intersperse Lu Sheng’s adventures with excerpts from plays including Macbeth and King Lear. The choices deliver little insight, with few exceptions such as the use of “Fear no more the heat o’ the sun” as Lu Sheng faces death.The Chinese performers outshine the Shakespearean actors, and not just because of their more colourful and elaborate costumes, which brighten up the 17th-century Actors’ Church in Covent Garden no end. There’s masterful work from Ke Jun as the hero, witty Li Hongliang as the immortal and Xu Yunxiu as the long-suffering wife, and solid support from the small orchestra in both Kunqu arias and Shakespearean songs."

Scene settings are customarily reimagined but at every turn there is a blurring of reality and fiction – right from the overture, during which a period-costumed Cosi cast is taking its curtain call. The ‘actual’ two couples are opera-goers from the auditorium, who stray on to the stage, so beginning an exploration of the churning gulf that lies between the real and the acted, the truth and the mask.The Brief Encounter-like train platform, choking with limpet-like couples, where the friends Ferrando and Guglielmo take leave of their respective lovers; the smart bar lined with available men, where the girls greet their returning lovers (now in disguise, to test their faithfulness); and the two heavily staged garden scenes (one a plastic Eden complete with serpent and forbidden fruit, the other a breathtaking Baroque-naturalistic idyll applied to stage flats) – whether ‘real’ or ‘staged’, these settings are equally able to influence the characters’ feelings and behaviours.While all this disorientation could prove nauseating, remarkably, it wraps around the solid comic core of the opera. This success is no doubt also down to a shining cast: Corinne Winters’s rich-toned Fiordiligi contrasts with Angela Brower’s lighter lyrical Dorabella; Daniel Behle fetchingly adopts gentle head-tone colouring in Un Aura Amorosa and Alessio Arduini is a virile Guglielmo. Sabina Puertolas exudes street-smart confidence as Despina and Johannes Martin Kranzle delights in his role as social architect. Semyon Byckow draws richly varied colours from the Royal Opera Orchestra, though occasionally favours slow tempos.The deeper we go into Gloger’s exploration, the more the confusion seems to makes sense. The mildly unsettling conclusion to the question of what love is perhaps turns out to be that in reality (literally) we often don’t have a clue."

Born in Warsaw in 1935, Robert Andrzej Krauthammer was one of thousands of Jews relocated five years later to the Ghetto by the Nazis. His grandmother somehow got him out, while his mother was sent to Treblinka. The former also renamed him Andre Tchaikowsky (after her favourite Russian composer) to disguise his origins.Not only did Tchaikowsky survive the war, but he became an internationally acclaimed concert pianist, eventually settling in England. He wrote music, too, though his primary career left him little time for composition, and by the time of his death in 1982 he had failed to persuade anyone to perform this Shakespearean opera – his magnum opus. It finally reached the stage in Bregenz in 2013.In some ways the result is disappointing. For the first two acts, Tchaikowsky sets the text in grey and anonymous vocal lines that reflect the fashionable modernism of the period (1968-82) and which register as capable but inexpressive.But with the trial scene the opera, and Keith Warner’s skilful staging, lifts off. One is gripped and ultimately intensely moved by Tchaikowsky’s response to Shylock’s humiliation, which is so marvellously realised by American baritone Lester Lynch that it becomes almost unbearable to watch.Fine performances from Sarah Castle’s eloquent Portia, Verena Gunz’s quick-witted Nerissa, Lauren Michelle’s lithe, lyrical Jessica and Bruce Sledge’s warm-toned Lorenzo flesh out the drama, though countertenor Martin Wolfel fails to make sufficient impact as Antonio.Lionel Friend conducts a performance that is absolutely assured, showing off some fine things in the orchestral writing, notably a powerful Alban Berg-like interlude between the last two scenes. While the opera as a whole is less than satisfactory, the third act and epilogue are incredibly memorable."

In visual terms Mears and his designers refer to more than late 20th-century conflict, with a poignant video of devastation and tragic loss of life and hope accompanying the moving chorus of Scottish refugees. Annemarie Wood’s adaptable set works well throughout the show, emphasising the drab political background out of which shines the Macbeths’ lurid parvenu vulgarity. Whether as soldiers, courtiers or witches, WNO’s famed chorus has a strong evening.But the decision to replace some of Verdi’s own considered revisions to the piece – made nearly 20 years following its 1847 premiere – with his weaker first ideas hampers the evening’s success, as does the indifferent conducting of Andriy Yurkevych, who seems oblivious to the score’s meaningful detail and its need for momentum. There are visual oddities, too, to Mears’ staging – artificial hand gestures in particular – which get in the way of a narrative he mostly presents with clarity and at times with powerful eloquence.Returning following previous successes with the company is American soprano Mary Elizabeth Williams, who possesses genuine star quality and is seemingly unfazed by the extravagant vocal demands of Lady Macbeth: while her compelling sleepwalking scene is truly outstanding, she’s impressive throughout.By her side Luis Cansino’s Macbeth is vocally and dramatically ordinary, though Miklos Sebestyen and Bruce Sledge offer finely sung and focused portrayals as Banquo and Macduff respectively.The overall result may be uneven, but at its best the show offers genuine musical and theatrical insight."

More Luciano Pavarotti than Juan Diego Florez in terms of physique, he is stylish and unstinting in his final display of coloratura pyrotechnics, music that always used to be cut. Buenos Aires-born mezzo-soprano Daniela Mack, a 2013 BBC Cardiff Singer of the World finalist, is a feisty, vibrant, distinctly un-mellow Rosina. That the lovers are both new to Covent Garden is something of a tradition for a show that needs fresh voices to soften its cartoonish unreality.Of the echt Italians, Vito Priante musters impressive beauty of line and tone as Figaro, arriving via the stalls dressed like a toddler. And veteran bass Ferruccio Furlanetto returns to reprise his Don Basilio, a wonderfully sonorous grotesque. The cantankerous Doctor Bartolo is Portuguese, Jose Fardilha in another effective house debut.Conductor Henrik Nanasi deploys a fortepiano for the recits and can be challengingly fast yet feels no need to purge the string tone of all warmth. Soloists are occasionally swamped but the impression remains of a genuine team effort."

And this new version, at Islington’s King’s Head, accompanied by piano plus cello, feels at least as authentic as many big opera house productions too.“Radically new” takes on Puccini’s 19th century tale of love, laughter and tragedy among impoverished Parisian artists have often been promised before, and this latest update by King’s Head artistic director Adam Spreadbury-Maher, relocated to contemporary East London, is not far removed from OperaUpClose’s version, seen at this venue just last year. But in paring down the cast even further – there is no space for fellow bohemians Colline and Schaunard, let alone hordes of revellers – the production becomes an intense focus on the two central couples.There is plenty of fun too – an important ingredient of the original – at least in the first half. The second works fine without light relief. Those on the front row risk starring as a surrogate Alcindoro with Musetta on their lap.Success is due in large part to a slick new English libretto by Spreadbury-Maher and Becca Marriot (who also plays Mimi in the double-cast performances), convincingly colloquial if too self-consciously sweary. Their Mimi is a heroine addict – plausible and compelling, though it fundamentally changes the nature of Puccini’s tuberculosis victim.Stephanie Edward’s Mimi and Tom Isherwood’s Marcello (Mark) impressed vocally. They and Roberto Abate’s Rodolfo (Ralph) and Caroline Kennedy’s Musetta embody their roles with equal conviction."

Yet perversely only one group – resembling some sort of right-wing Catholic militia, only with female priests – seems to represent both sides simultaneously, removing the crucial element of external conflict that makes Norma’s betrayal of her people and her religion unforgivable. The entire meaning of the piece falls apart.There are some vocal compensations, especially in the bold attempt on the notoriously demanding title-role from the young Bulgarian soprano Sonya Yoncheva, who bravely replaced Anna Netrebko when she withdrew in April. She sings with consistent skill and impressive technical assurance in an altogether remarkable first shot at a role to which she will surely add the necessary dramatic definition as she develops it.By her side, Sonia Ganassi’s Adalgisa is little more than respectably solid, while Joseph Calleja brings some flair and panache to Pollione. As Oroveso, Brindley Sherratt’s vocalism has too many rough edges.
Antonio Pappano conducts a performance that could do with more momentum. There’s a mixture of booing and cheering for the production team at the curtain, on a ratio of about 50/50."

It first came to the UK in 2012, co-produced by Wales Millennium Centre, and this latest version, which continues on to Southampton, Dublin, Birmingham and Salford, incorporates important musical changes. The first act, chronicling tribal initiation rites and the young Mandela’s decision to leave his home town, is newly scored by Peter Louis van Dijk, whose accessible contemporary style – shades of Janacek and Philip Glass – also drives the powerful final act of imprisonment and eventual freedom.The central section, rebellious 1950s, remains Mike Campbell’s jazz musical. Surprisingly, this has less energy, the middle-of-the-road score inhibited compared to van Dijk’s more dramatic approach. Consistency is ensured with use of Xhosa folk music throughout, and by Michael Williams’s libretto, duly serious but with plenty of humour.The large cast, lead by Mandla Mndebele’s superbly dignified and human Mandela in maturity (there are two younger personifications), is terrific. And, although RFH audiences have to make do without sets (it is fully staged everywhere else), Michael Mitchell’s colourful costumes and Sibonakaliso Ndaba’s lively choreography provide plenty of theatricality.Incongruously, there is just one black musician in the 40-strong orchestra (the combined forces of Cape Town Philharmonic and London-based 12 Ensemble), in marked contrast to the almost entirely black cast; both composers are white South Africans. The classical music world still has a lot of work to do towards racial parity."

Based at Dalston’s Arcola Theatre, a converted warehouse in north-east London, Grimeborn exudes a confident, fringe-style identity, expanding this year to 16 new productions across seven weeks. Edgy, contemporary works sit alongside shoestring versions of classics such as Tosca and The Marriage of Figaro. The hit rate inevitably varies; despite a promising idea, The Dowager’s Oyster falls some way short of success.Billed as ‘Gilbert and Sullivan meets Agatha Christie’, this new 1920s-set ‘operetta’ disappoints on both counts. Laden with self-conscious nods to flapper-era perkiness, composer Louis Mander’s contemporary-idiom score displays little Sullivanesque sparkle or melodic elan; director Jack Cherry’s laborious libretto has no Gilbertian wit, smart wordsmithery or, most importantly, fun.After a plodding first half that concludes with the death of the titular dowager, the second becomes a half-hearted whodunnit, investigated by a pale Poirot knock-off, with none of Christie’s genius plotting. The murder element seems incidental, while the most effective moments are those not trying to be funny – such as hapless young Cynthia’s love song to her fiance Freddy, which returns as a poignant duet between Freddy and his secret gay lover, a union outlawed in their time.With some decent operatic voices and an excellent band (piano, accordion, drums and bass) the music is well-served, and the small ensemble cast does its best to inject life into the humdrum text, but this sadly flat affair needs bags more zip if it really aspires to call itself farce."

No company in the land can match its collective know-how in bringing out to the max the humour of such pieces.Its current programme consists of two entirely forgotten one-act works by Offenbach: Croquefer, or The Last of the Paladins, which premiered in Paris in 1857, and The Isle of Tulipatan, which dates from 11 years later. Both are sung in Clarke’s own bright and breezy translations, and he directs them in his customary and entirely appropriate style of madcap mayhem.Croquefer has an almost Pythonesque plot – though it’s a good deal ruder, not to say indecent. Noisily heroic as played by Carl Sanderson, the title character is a medieval knight whose 23-year-old feud with his tongue-less enemy Rattlebone (Paul Featherstone grunts his way manfully through the role) is on the point of reaching its violent climax when cunningly poisoned wine brings on a bout of collective diarrhoea that renders all combatants incapable of fighting.In The Isle of Tulipatan, wrongly assigned gender afflicts both Prince Alexis (neatly sung by Caroline Kennedy) and Field Marshal Rhomboid’s daughter Hermosa (a hilarious personification from Anthony Flaum). When their real sexual identities are finally uncovered, they happily team up.Clarke’s stagings relish the outrageous absurdity of both pieces, while the two scores turn out to be top-drawer Offenbach, each one a succession of clever and attractive numbers expertly delivered by the cast and given sharpness and vivacity by conductor Toby Purser.The five singers involved take part in both operas. As well as Prince Alexis, Kennedy is wonderfully dim as Croquefer’s squire, Fireball, with Flaum insanely vain as his nephew Headstrong. Lynsey Docherty is winsome as Rattlebone’s daughter Peasblossom and hyper-sophisticated as Rhomboid’s guilty wife, Theodorine."

As well as performing the Western classics, Chinese companies are increasingly commissioning their own operas in a Western style incorporating Chinese elements, and it’s good that the current London visit by artists from the Shanghai Opera House brings an admired example.Born in 1949, composer and librettist Mo Fan survived the Cultural Revolution and has gone on to produce a substantial catalogue of works including Thunderstorm, based on a play by the dramatist Cao Yu and first performed in concert in 2001.The plot of this melodramatic 1930s play deals with intense, long-hidden relationships between members of a well-off family and their servants, involving multiple incestuous liaisons and eventually leading to madness and suicide: the numerous dark secrets are revealed over the course of a cataclysmic thunderstorm during which two characters are killed by lightning.Mo Fan’s fluent score is skilfully written for voices, chorus and an orchestra that adds a couple of traditional Chinese instruments to the standard symphonic forces of the late-Romantic era.Its limitations are stylistic. The piece is written in an idiom familiar from European composers working nearly 100 years ago: the result feels like a pastiche of (among others) Debussy, Puccini, Rachmaninov, Janacek and Bartok, with an occasional use of authentic Chinese elements.Despite the score’s derivative nature, the cast seizes opportunities within a staging that is basic but effective. All the voices show quality, with a particular standout from tenor Han Peng as Zhou Ping, the son of the household, and a star performance from soprano Xu Xiaoying as his stepmother and onetime lover Fanyi. Conductor Zhang Guoyong is in charge of a convincing musical realisation."
245,A Midsummer Night’s Dream opera review at Glyndebourne – ‘effective revival’,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2016/midsummer-nights-dream-opera-review-glyndebourne-effective-revival/,A Midsummer Night’s Dream opera,Glyndebourne – ‘effective revival’,A Midsummer Night’s Dream opera review at Glyndebourne,4,2016-08-12,David Gutman,"In an age in which Britten’s take on Shakespeare can morph into a disquisition on paedophilia at directorial whim, Peter Hall’s celebrated production, first seen in 1981, risks seeming like a relic from a different age. That the show works so well in this revival says much about the skill of the original team in creating a magical realm in the service of the score, sufficient unto itself.Aspects that were once innovative – the trees in constant movement and a forest design concept in blue-black and silver – remain striking, while unsuspected warmth and humanity is found in Britten’s score.The Glyndebourne venue itself contributes not a little to the success of the evening, even if patrons take a while to settle during the druggy opening glissandi.Back inside, the intimations of cruelty are never overplayed by a mostly experienced cast including veterans of the Met Opera’s 2013 revival and past participants in the present show.Young David Evans is arguably the hero of the night. A late substitution as the non-singing, morally ambiguous Puck, he is strikingly confident and challengingly un-posh. Towering over him is counter-tenor Tim Mead’s well projected, suitably unearthly Oberon. Matthew Rose reprises his virile and booming Bottom.It is not easy to make much of the human lovers, and Kate Royal’s vibrato is becoming the dominant feature of her Helena. Vocally speaking, Elizabeth DeShong’s Hermia fares better with a nice line in physical comedy.The rustics’ play within a play represents Britten at his feeblest but, as throughout, the present team members give it their all. And Puck gets the last word."

While last summer it presented close to 50 (admittedly short) shows rotating over nearly three weeks, this year’s series, forming part of the Cubitt Sessions at the heart of King’s Cross’ new N1C quarter, runs to only six productions. On the plus side, the performances are now free; on the minus side, the al fresco central location presents many distractions.The Remarkable Rocket, this year’s penultimate show, is true to Tete a Tete form, at least, in eluding the definition of opera. Based on Oscar Wilde’s short story about a vain, self-important and tragically pathetic firework rocket, it features a raucous street band-like ensemble, rasping, glissing and oom-pahing their way through a score in which Michael Nyman meets Madness. A jester-cum-Emcee figure (sung and acted with panache by Dingle Yandell) knits together the narrative such as there is one: the characters are too thinly defined and often in this space (despite amplification) you can’t hear the words. The interposed open-mic gala comprising a selection of arias (invariably cut short by the Jester) ought to be a minor aside but instead it defiantly herniates the unfolding of the action.The anarchy and dark comedy may be distinctive and refreshing, but the vocal writing lacks a pungency to match. Nevertheless the singers acquit themselves well, not least Przemyslaw Baranek, who as the Remarkable Rocket, is towards the end placed in front of the stage and therefore left to fend for himself without a microphone."
247,Norma review at Edinburgh International Festival – ‘dramatically strong’,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2016/norma-review-at-edinburgh-international-festival/,Norma,Edinburgh International Festival – ‘dramatically strong’,Norma review at Edinburgh International Festival,4,2016-08-06,George Hall,"This year’s Edinburgh International Festival’s operatic programme begins with a staging borrowed from the Salzburg Whitsun event – a good way in which Edinburgh can raise its game within a limited budget. The festival has certainly pushed the boat out in attracting a major star like Cecilia Bartoli. She reprises the role of Norma, which she first sang three years ago in this staging by the directorial duo of Moshe Leiser and Patrice Caurier.Originally set in Gaul during the Roman occupation, Bellini’s bel canto masterpiece is moved here to the Second World War, where Norma and her father Oroveso become French Resistance commanders. Their crucial role as religious leaders – Norma is a Druidic high priestess, whose pronouncements that are supposedly received directly from the gods determine war or peace – is considerably diminished, as Bartoli herself more or less admits in an interview in the programme booklet.Bartoli is the artistic director of the Salzburg Whitsun event, and clearly intends Norma to showcase her talents in what is a rare appearance in a staged opera in the UK and apparently her Edinburgh debut. In a fundamental sense hers is a vocally controversial assumption, since Bellini described Norma as a soprano role, just as reference books usually define its creator, Giuditta Pasta, as a soprano.Pointing out that Pasta also sang mezzo roles is Bartoli’s justification for taking it on herself – indeed she prefers to leave her own vocal designation non-specific these days, though it’s hard to hear the colours of her voice as other than mezzo in quality.Perhaps more importantly, she brings to the part a strong dramatic commitment that increases as the evening goes on, overriding some ungainly sounds at the top and bottom of her voice and a fair amount of approximation when the going gets technically tough. At any rate, she completely wins over the Edinburgh audience, which rewards her with an ovation.The rest of the show is good but not special, though John Osborn’s fluent Pollione is vocally exciting. Soprano Rebeca Olvera’s decent Adalgisa is no serious challenge to Bartoli, and though Peter Kalman’s Oroveso is solid he could do with more vocal sophistication.The staging begins in a schoolroom that later becomes a refugee hideout and then a meeting place for resistance fighters: the Italian partisans of Roberto Rossellini’s 1945 film Rome, Open City (Roma Citta Aperta) are also referenced, with Bartoli consciously modelling her performance on Anna Magnani. Some parts of the result are a good deal more convincing than others.The first night was taken over at short notice from the scheduled conductor, Diego Fasolis, by the production’s chorus master, Gianluca Capuano, who delivered a brisk account of the score with the period-instrument I Barocchisti performing skilfully in the pit."
248,The Queen of Spades at Opera Holland Park review – ‘steadily rising tension’,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2016/the-queen-of-spades-2/,The Queen of Spades at Opera Holland Park review – ‘steadily rising tension’,,The Queen of Spades at Opera Holland Park review,4,2016-08-03,George Hall,"Opera Holland Park brings its outstanding 2016 season to a close with this fine production of Tchaikovsky’s creepy melodrama, The Queen of Spades, based on a short story by Pushkin.Cordelia Chisholm’s unit set – a series of neoclassical arches with a proscenium stage and curtains in the middle – may have you wondering exactly where some of the opera’s numerous scenes are taking place, but it is imaginatively used and proves surprisingly adaptable. The masked ball (marvellous costumes here and indeed throughout), the Countess’s bedroom and the gambling den are superbly visualised, with the Opera Holland Park Chorus once again giving us exceptional collective singing and finely detailed individual performances.Set in period, the show takes a while to strike form, as do its two leads – Peter Wedd’s increasingly unhinged Herman and Natalya Romaniw’s insecure Liza; both are momentarily challenged by their long and taxing roles. Conductor Peter Robinson could do more to help them by keeping the City of London Sinfonia’s brass section in check. There’s the odd minor problem of ensemble, too.Both Wedd and Romaniw nevertheless come through with performances of strength and conviction, especially in the second half of the show, whose steadily rising tension is partly the result of director Rodula Gaitanou’s surefooted stagecraft, but owes much, too, to Rosalind Plowright’s commanding assumption of the elderly, cantankerous Countess. Her reappearances from beyond the grave are appropriately scene-stealing.Grant Doyle is a suave but slightly dry sounding Yeletsky, Richard Burkhard a gamely extravert Tomsky. The opera is sung in the original Russian, as usual at Holland Park: there’s an argument, nevertheless, that an English translation – there are good ones around – might prove even more communicative."
249,Beatrice et Benedict review at Glyndebourne – ‘immaculately sung’,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2016/beatrice-et-benedict-review-at-glyndebourne/,Beatrice et Benedict,Glyndebourne – ‘immaculately sung’,Beatrice et Benedict review at Glyndebourne,3,2016-07-25,George Hall,"Berlioz’s light comedy fillets Much Ado about Nothing, concentrating on the sparring between Stephanie d’Oustrac’s Beatrice and Paul Appleby’s Benedict – both roles immaculately sung in Glyndebourne’s first-ever production, though in Laurent Pelly’s amiable staging the two principals take a while to strike sparks off each other.As usual, Glyndebourne performs the work – which contains a good deal of spoken dialogue, here more closely aligned by adapter Agathe Melinand with Shakespeare than with Berlioz’s version – in the original French, though English might have worked better.Pelly’s mainly Francophone cast nevertheless does a good job with both dialogue and music, the women especially producing delicious vocal highlights in ensembles involving Sophie Karthauser’s tender Hero and Katarina Bradic’s supportive Ursule, as well as some great solo numbers, in which Appleby’s buoyant tenor also shines.Director Pelly and Belgian baritone Lionel Lhote do everything they can with the interpolated scenes involving the self-obsessed composer-conductor Somarone, but they remain intractably tedious.There’s a problem, too, with Barbara de Limburg’s overall design, mainly to do with its curiously undeviating reliance on shades of grey: the Sicilian setting, the comic plot concerning two wilful individuals refusing to acknowledge their love for each other, and above all Berlioz’s rich and vibrant score, would all seem to presuppose something altogether brighter and more colourful. Limburg’s complex system of boxes endlessly reconfigured is appealingly abstract but its connection to the piece is obscure. Pelly’s costumes suggest, for some reason, 1950s France.Though the production’s stagecraft is sure-footedly effective, the evening’s best element is Berlioz’s score, witty, exciting, charming and just sheerly beautiful by turns, which the principals, the top-quality Glyndebourne Chorus, and the excellent London Philharmonic Orchestra all deliver with spirit under the focused baton of conductor Antonello Manacorda."
250,Die Fledermaus review at Opera Holland Park – ‘commendable’,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2016/die-fledermaus-review-at-opera-holland-park/,Die Fledermaus,Opera Holland Park – ‘commendable’,Die Fledermaus review at Opera Holland Park,3,2016-07-20,George Hall,"Operetta is a truly difficult art to master. Not only do you need high quality voices able to sing technically demanding music, but you have to dance as well as putting dialogue over effectively. In Martin Lloyd-Evans’s new staging of Die Fledermaus for Opera Holland Park, all of the singing reaches a commendable standard, and some much more, but not all of Alistair Beaton’s spoken text comes across as it should, while Adam Scown’s choreography feels dutifully executed rather than tip-top.Lloyd-Evans and his designer Takis move the setting from late 19th-century Vienna to the UK in the 1920s – if the art deco sets and policemen’s uniforms are anything to go by. It looks handsome enough, though some of the sophistication of the original has gone missing.When the guests at Prince Orlofsky’s party start stripping as if for an orgy while the text sings of universal brotherhood, you know that something has gone wrong. The thin final act – always a problem in this piece – drags terribly, with Ian Jervis’s sub-satirical comic routine as Frosch heavy-going. After the festival’s exceptional first three shows, overall this is something of a disappointment.But there are nevertheless strong elements. Amidst a set of decent to good principal performances, Gavan Ring’s Dr Falke has all the debonair style the piece needs. Jennifer France sings Adele with flair. Conductor John Rigby brings not only energy but genuine Viennese lilt to Strauss’s masterly score. Though she’s strictly surplus to requirements, burlesque dancer Didi Derriere adds a touch of chic to Orlofsky’s party, though the prince’s Russian accent needs a bit of beefing up.The costumes are at their best here, too, while throughout the Holland Park Chorus and the City of London Sinfonia maintain the high standards they set at the beginning of the season."
251,La Cenerentola review at Opera Holland Park – ‘glamorous and spirited’,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2016/la-cenerentola-review-at-opera-holland-park/,La Cenerentola,Opera Holland Park – ‘glamorous and spirited’,La Cenerentola review at Opera Holland Park,4,2016-07-15,George Hall,"Oliver Platt’s staging of Rossini’s comedy based on the Cinderella story represents Opera Holland Park’s first ever co-production, with the Danish National Opera – and what a fine show this is from a visual point of view.Setting the piece in Rossini’s own period – La Cenerentola premiered in Rome in 1817 – designer Neil Irish provides richly varied costumes: colourful huntsmen for Prince Ramiro’s retinue, madly over the top dresses for Fleur de Bray and Heather Lowe as Cenerentola’s mean-spirited (not ‘ugly’ in the operatic version) sisters Clorinda and Tisbe, and full-on glamour for the guests at Prince Ramiro’s ball.The show even has a transformation scene, when Don Magnifico’s down-at-heel apartment, with its peeling wallpaper, turns in an instant into the Prince’s palace. It’s something of a triumph.Musically and dramatically we’re on firm ground, too. Nico Darmanin has all the top notes and plentiful energy for the dashing prince. Jonathan Veira offers a classic buffo performance as the pompous Don Magnifico – the kind of role he does better than anyone else in the UK. Barnaby Rea’s grand bass gives him weight and gravitas as Alidoro, the prince’s tutor, who rescues Cenerentola from the cinders.Though the coloratura comes less naturally to them, Nicholas Lester makes an eminently likable Dandini and Victoria Simmonds brings warmth and pathos to the title role.The comedy has been finely and purposefully rehearsed, though once or twice Emma Brunton’s choreography feels a touch hyperactive. The young Australian Dane Lam’s conducting is precise and spirited, encouraging the company’s lively chorus to give of their best and the City of London Sinfonia to convey Rossini’s score with clarity and focus. Taken as a whole, the show confirms that Holland Park is on something of a roll this season."
252,Le Nozze di Figaro review at Glyndebourne – ‘a potent revival’,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2016/le-nozze-di-figaro-review-at-glyndebourne/,Le Nozze di Figaro,Glyndebourne – ‘a potent revival’,Le Nozze di Figaro review at Glyndebourne,4,2016-07-04,Edward Bhesania,"Michael Grandage’s Le Nozze di Figaro – new in 2012 and now revived by Ian Rutherford – is unmistakably set in Seville, with its intricate Moorish decorative architecture and mosaic tile patterns, but the period has transferred from the late 18th century to the 1960s. There’s a heady whiff of flower power to the costumes and the suitably foppish Count Almaviva is styled as something of a prototype Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen. Christopher Oram’s revolving set lends a seamless continuity to the narrative: a device especially effective in allowing the Act III wedding party to continue as the intricately detailed moonlit cloister is revealed in the Act IV garden scene.If the first two acts don’t quite crackle with comic brilliance, it’s partly down to the handling of the page-boy Cherubino, sung by Natalia Kawalek stepping in to replace Serena Malfi. The exaggerations of girl playing adolescent boy (not to mention of when said adolescent boy is further disguised as a girl) look inherently awkward. But the singing is fine throughout: Golda Schultz may be younger than many Countesses, but she convincingly reflects the pain of her rejection, and the lack of heaviness in the voice makes for a nicely balanced Act III duet with Susanna (impressively sung Rosa Feola, allying the role’s quick-wittedness to an ideal steely clarity in the voice).Gyula Orendt as the Count manages to produce an air of authority amid the dandyism, and allows Davide Luciano’s Figaro to take on a more traditionally machismo stance. Also putting in strong performances are Carlo Lepore’s comic Bartolo and John Graham-Hall’s unsettlingly leering Basilio. But the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment occasionally sounds buttoned up, less adept at releasing searing instrumental colours than at underpinning emotional intensity."

Welsh National Opera has marked the appalling carnage by commissioning a new opera from 36-year-old English composer Iain Bell.He sets a libretto based on the 1937 poem of the same name by the painter and writer David Jones, which was hugely admired by the likes of TS Eliot as one of the major works of art to derive from the First World War, during which its creator served in the Royal Welch Fusiliers. In both poem and opera, he’s represented by Private John Ball – a perfect dramatic fit as personified by tenor Andrew Bidlack, though the part taxes him vocally.The chaos and misery of war register terrifyingly in David Pountney’s production, though a more mystical, folksy side of Jones’ text takes up a good deal of the less convincing second act, where the Queen of the Woods and her attendant dryads initially bring death and destruction to the soldiers but then bestow regeneration on the land and the dead.Bell’s score is technically exceptional, with fine writing for soloists, chorus and orchestra and both an immediacy and a momentum that are entirely persuasive. Carlo Rizzi conducts an assured account of a piece that demonstrates a complete command of the operatic medium.There are standout performances from the two narrators – Peter Coleman – Wright’s Bard of Britannia, doubling as HQ Officer, and from Alexandra Deshorties as the Bard of Germania, tripling as Alice the Barmaid and Queen of the Woods. Among many other striking contributions Donald Maxwell’s Dai Greatcoat, Graham Clark’s the Marne Sergeant and Mark Le Brocq’s Sergeant Snell are also memorable."

Alden and his design team move the action from a picturesque Moravian village in the late 19th century to a run-down Eastern bloc industrial estate in the dying days of the Communist system.Charles Edwards’ set for Act I is a grungy factory yard, where Valerie Reid’s expertly crafted Grandmother Burya is a timekeeper in a booth. Her daughter-in-law the Kostelnicka’s home is spartan to the point of looking poverty-stricken, a broken window mended only just in time for the called-off wedding in Act 3. Together with Jon Morrell’s intensely character specific costumes and Adam Silverman’s atmospheric lighting, Alden’s direction remains as sharp as ever.Designed for large and incisive Slavic instruments, Janacek’s vocal lines are extremely demanding, and while all the principals provide good value and often more, not every participant can muster quite the sonic charge required.But each of the central performances registers impressively from a dramatic point of view. Nicky Spence is bold as brass as the cocky Steva, who ditches Jenufa once she has lost her obvious physical appeal through disfigurement. As his gawky, resentful half-brother Laca, Peter Hoare presents an embittered individual eventually redeemed by his capacity to love.But the central focus is on two extremely strong women. Laura Wilde’s empowered lyricism helps lift Jenufa out of the painful trials that beset her into wisdom and maturity. As her loving stepmother the Kostelnicka, who murders the baby she fears will destroy both their reputations, Michaela Martens rises to greatness.ENO’s chorus hurls itself into the drama with unquenchable energy, while under master accompanist Mark Wigglesworth’s impeccable baton the company’s orchestra plays Janacek’s thrilling score as if possessed."

The one on the left opens to reveal a sequence of 18th-century interiors, cleverly changed each time the doors are closed to surprise the audience with new configurations. Out of the one on the right clamber Trojan prisoners of war, consciously referencing today’s refugees arriving on the southern shores of Europe. Clark’s costumes, too, blend ancient and modern.Within these visuals director Tim Albery presents the narrative clearly, though the sea-monster that menaces the Cretan populace as a sign of Neptune’s displeasure is inevitably a challenge. Here the stage splits in two and members of the chorus suddenly become violently ill – though their realistic vomiting immediately before the long dinner interval is unfortunately timed.The central casting is impressive, led by a star performance from Toby Spence, whose vividly voiced, internally conflicted Idomeneo is consistently involving. Caitlin Hulcup is vocally eloquent and convincingly male as his son Idamante. As the Trojan princess Ilia, Louise Alder’s gentle lyricism forms an ideal contrast with Rebecca von Lipinski’s fiery and flamboyant Elettra.There’s focused support from Timothy Robinson as Idomeneo’s loyal friend Arbace, while Robert Murray makes the audience sit up with his intervention as the High Priest of Neptune. The sea-god himself is usually presented merely as a voice-off, but here Nicholas Masters gives him tangible and memorable form.Whether portraying Trojan prisoners or the indigenous Cretan fishing community, Garsington’s chorus sings with tremendous attack, while the orchestra responds to conductor Tobias Ringborg’s flexible approach with a notable sense of historically informed style."

In the four-act version, as adopted here, we are plunged into the candlelit San Yuste monastery where Carlos V is laid to rest. Even outside, in the following scene, the sunlight is all but obscured by foliage. In Act III, moonlight faintly creeps into King Philip’s study, but the main focus is the raging fireplace; like the pyre on which he burns heretics – women and children included – the theme underpinning Philip’s regime is heat, not light.Clive Bayley is compelling as King Philip – robust in voice but also physically insidious and domineering. He despatches terrifying pronouncements with unwavering coolness and has no hesitation in killing his son Carlos – whose betrothed, Elisabeth, he has himself married. Philip’s stand-off with the Grand Inquisitor (admirably sung and acted by Alastair Miles) is brimming with tension.If Virginia Tola’s Elizabeth is underwhelming, despite some heavenly high pianissimos, Ruxandra Dunose’s Princess Eboli is vividly characterised: she conveys a parade of shifting emotions and behaviours, from her coquettish first meeting with Posa, to bitter vengeance when she is passed over by Carlos, to utter remorse after having betrayed Elisabeth.As Carlos, Stefano Secco lacks for nothing in terms of heroism and stamina, displaying a brilliant, powerful instrument, but David Stout as Rodrigo is the real hero of the piece, giving up his life in order that Carlos might liberate Flanders. He lends a much-needed streak of charisma to the mix."

The scene for Werther’s Act IV garret is no exception, except that it begins as a thumbnail at the rear of the stage and gradually moves towards us.The cast is immune to the stultifying design. Johann and Schmidt, the Mayor’s drinking partners, make for colourful figures – particularly the latter, sung with ringing clarity by Francois Piolino. For his part David Bizic is unusually engaging as Albert (the safe option Charlotte promised her dying mother she would marry).Charlotte’s sister, Sophie, is Heather Engebretson, who skips and bounds around full of youthful optimism. She’s equally agile of voice with a purity of tone that makes her a joy to listen to. Joyce DiDonato perceptively conveys the torment of Charlotte’s struggle to reconcile her duty to Albert and her stirring love for Werther, and if occasionally her pitch distorts at high volume, the expression is thrilling.Werther is sung by star tenor Vittorio Grigolo, who gives a sensational performance. The dashing looks and trim physique help, but his ability to modulate his epic sound in the blink of eye, to vary colour and depth is often breathtaking. He sings his Act III Pourquoi me Reveiller and the ensuing duet with Charlotte, with such passion and vigour as to almost physically overwhelm her. In the pit Antonio Pappano shapes the score’s lyricism as well as he unleashes its dramatic despair."

Life is all but wiped out. Aphra is one of the few to have survived disease and flooding following the environmental meltdown. She is holed up in a high-altitude weather station, but will perish within weeks.On a distant planet, the year is 3001. A female cohort decide to intercede by attempting to communicate with a sisterhood of ordinary, ethnically diverse women back in 2016. They must act now – be the agents of change – in order to save Aphra and their planet.Opera for the Unknown Woman may sound like a sci-fi movie, but it is a thought-provoking musical drama, strongly performed by an ensemble cast. Wilson’s and Glowicka’s music is relatively unshowy, allowing imaginative video projections, electronic music and sound design to wrap seamlessly around it. As the action quick-cuts between the three temporal planes there are contrasting sounds to match. For the 2016 sisters, there are individual numbers featuring a percussionist, cellist and violinist but also, most strikingly, bursts of primally moving Middle-Eastern and Bulgarian singing; and Aphra’s final message to the cosmos is a radiant combination of psalm-like ancient strains and otherworldly, smoothly jumping vocal lines.There is some halting of pace towards the end and a final chorus that outstays its welcome, and ultimately the apocalypse feels too easily averted. But the absorbing aural landscape holds the attention, with the help of clever sound design and amplification. Even if the feminist sci-fi environmental-disaster opera genre doesn’t take wing, this is a flare flung confidently into the void."

Why are King Marke and his Cornish knights presented as Japanese warriors? Why do Tristan’s loyal servant Kurwenal and Isolde’s handmaiden Brangane appear as primping and preening fops from some Restoration comedy? Such touches make Kramer’s approach look frivolous.Visually and dramatically the third act coheres far better than the previous two, with Kramer exploring the touching depths of the relationship between Craig Colclough’s Kurwenal and Stuart Skelton’s Tristan in scenes that might come from a play by Beckett. The result is uneven but at times worthwhile.Musically this Tristan and Isolde is on stronger ground.  Heidi Melton’s Irish princess is vocally inconsistent but her best singing shows strength and purpose: she has enough left at the end of the evening to deliver a respectable Liebestod. Colclough’s strongest vocalism also comes in Act 3. Karen Cargill’s Brangane sings with exceptional tonal beauty all evening, her famous warning to the lovers filtered in magically from the wings. Matthew Rose makes a moving King Marke.But the evening’s greatest stage performance comes from Heldentenor Stuart Skelton, whose Tristan is tireless and sung with profound conviction.He and the other singers are fortunate to have such a sensitive conductor as ENO’s former music director Edward Gardner in the pit: despite Wagner’s heavy orchestral demands, he makes it possible for virtually every word of the late Andrew Porter’s fine English translation to come through. The company’s orchestra is on excellent form, maintaining perfect balance and tonal quality throughout the long evening."
261,The Cunning Little Vixen review at Glyndebourne – ‘full of energy and passion’,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2016/the-cunning-little-vixen-review-at-glyndebourne/,The Cunning Little Vixen,Glyndebourne – ‘full of energy and passion’,The Cunning Little Vixen review at Glyndebourne,5,2016-06-13,Graham Rogers,"Based on a comic-strip, Janacek’s The Cunning Little Vixen is a unique operatic beast. Premiered in 1924, the tale of woodland creatures and their often sensual interaction with humans has enchanting folksy elements – but Vixen is emphatically not a children’s opera. Despite plenty of fun, the overall tone is serious – without the kitchen-sink hand-wringing of Jenufa or Katya Kabanova. In fact, blessed with one of Janacek’s most radiant scores, Vixen’s special stylistic cocktail (and relatively short length) makes it ideal fare for summer opera festivals such as Glyndebourne – especially in such a smart, charming and moving production as this 2012 staging, returning for its first revival.Theatre director Melly Still understands Janacek’s blurred lines between human and natural worlds, and that cute fluffy costumes do the work an injustice. Dinah Collin dresses the woodland creatures in colourful, flamboyant clothes with witty defining characteristics – hedgehogs are timid peasants carrying sacks of firewood; chickens a bawdy chorus of hen-night blonds in thrall to a strutting Johnny Depp-like cockerel.Heart-stoppingly beautiful moments abound. The ever-shifting seasons are evocatively conveyed with light projections and giant silk sheets engulfing Tom Pye’s woodland set, and Mike Ashcroft’s balletic sequences are entrancing.Czech conductor Jakub Hrusa, attuned to the score’s every nuance, draws magnificent playing from the London Philharmonic. The cast is headed by Christopher Purves, a bloody-minded but ultimately sympathetic Forester, and Elena Tsallagova, a sexily roguish, flame-haired Vixen, who pays the ultimate price for her refusal to be mastered by man. The conclusion is cathartic rather than tragic though, a dancing vixen cub showing that life moves ever on, man and nature inexorably entwined."

Actually, the really radical approach would be to set it in Paris around 1830, just like it says in the libretto: no one’s done that in ages.Stephen Barlow’s production is presented in Shakespearean garb in an Elizabethan theatre, and apart from the quatercentenary celebrations no obvious reason springs to mind. But perhaps more important than why is the assurance with which Barlow directs the piece, closely examining the characters and their complex relationships and fitting the show’s intimate moments and the rough and tumble of the Act II crowd scene together into one fluent and brilliantly effective statement. Andrew D. Edward’s handsome set and sumptuous costumes help to give it both visual cohesion and a striking sense of identity.Barlow has clearly worked hard to help his cast focus their individual performances. Anna Patalong’s touching, liquid-voiced Mimi, Shaun Dixon’s vocally and physically dynamic Rodolfo, Elin Pritchard’s personality-girl Musetta and Andrew Finden’s thoughtful Marcello make a formidable central quartet.Around them the secondary roles all go well. David Woloszko’s self-satisfied Benoit and James Harrison’s painfully put-upon Alcindoro are sheer joy.Matthew Waldren conducts an account that is as perceptive in realising the detail of Puccini’s score as it is surefooted in overview. He energises the alert musicians of the City of London Sinfonia. The company’s chorus and children’s chorus, too, are in top gear."

The song-cycle appears at the end of a sequence of staged instrumental pieces by Debussy, John Adams and Britten, during which soprano Sarah Tynan lies in a bed suspended atop a wardrobe. Tynan’s nocturnal fantasies are animated by jugglers and acrobatics on aerial hoops, trapezes and fabrics, before she rises (perhaps somnambulant) to voice her rabid imaginings in the song-cycle. The opening line – “I alone have the key to this wild parade” – is one of many that validate this kind of staging.Gary McCann’s set comprises a cityscape of stacked wardrobes and drawers, creating perfect clambering matter for performers who define and inhabit a vertical plane. With no real narrative component across the pieces, the circus element occasionally loses impetus. But there are individual set pieces of sorts that provide pacing: a sensual male-female duet on straps in Debussy’s String Quartet; a solo female entwining herself in aerial silks, at first fitfully but then with masterly grace, in Britten’s rarely heard Reveille for violin and piano; and a double cloud swing acting as giant swinging pendulums to a movement from John Adams’ Shaker Loops.The playing of the Aurora Orchestra under Nicholas Collon matches the brilliance of the performers and Sarah Tynan’s combination of clean, vibrant tone and her willingness to end Les illuminations perched within a stratospheric hoop is breathtaking. With evocations of night-time and dreams elsewhere in Britten’s works, this treatment is surely one of which he would have approved."

The conductor and production team are the same as in the full-scale Ring which the festival built up over several years and performed complete in 2013.Taking on the title role of the medieval minstrel torn between sexual excess and emotional commitment, one of the most challenging in the Heldentenor repertory, is veteran John Treleaven, who manages to stay the course during the long evening but whose vocal quality is not what it used to be.During the overture Tannhauser is presented as Wagner, scribbling busily away at his desk while his wife Minna tries, unsuccessfully, to interest him in paying bills: it’s a glib attempt to link the composer directly to his artistic creation that is only half-heartedly resumed later on in the piece.Though all of the principal performances could do with more dramatic focus, Erika Madi Jones nevertheless creates a positive impression with her cleanly sung Elisabeth and Alison Kettlewell contrasts with her effectively as her polar opposite, the love goddess Venus.Icelandic baritone Hrolfur Saemundsson’s shy, poetic Wolfram is delivered with impeccable lyricism, while Donald Thomson’s Landgrave is consistently firm and authoritative.Though Treleaven’s vocally strained performance is a decidedly mixed quantity, much of the musical side of the evening achieves solid results; the orchestra is capable and the chorus very fine, while Wagner specialist conductor Anthony Negus once again demonstrates his considerable expertise in the repertoire, maintaining a sense of purpose and direction throughout. It’s in terms of the production and the visuals that Longborough still needs to raise its game."

This year’s choice is Mascagni’s Iris, premiered in 1898, six years before Puccini’s Madam Butterfly, which emulated its Japanese setting.In the case of Iris the location is hardly the point, though Mascagni gives his score a definite and often gorgeous oriental colouring. The opera itself is very different from Butterfly, and in many ways considerably tougher.The central character is a child who is abducted and placed in a brothel, where the wealthy client Osaka eventually gives up his attempt to persuade her to have sex with him. Believing her to have gone to work willingly in the red light district, her father – simply called the Blind Man – hurls abuse at her. She takes her own life, but as she lies dying there is still one act to go during which the piece moves ever more self-consciously into mystic symbolism, ending in an earth-shatteringly grand chorus in praise of life, love and the sun.One can imagine disastrous productions of the piece, but there’s a bravery and integrity to Olivia Fuchs’s staging that makes the evening utterly compelling, however gut-wrenching it may be along the way.Anne Sophie Duprels is an artist who always gives 100 percent, and her Iris is vocally and dramatically unstinting. While all of the male characters in the piece are unutterably vile, Noah Stewart delivers thrilling vocalism as the bullying Osaka while James Cleverton is credibly sinister as the pimp Kyoto and Mikhail Svetlov grandly baleful as Iris’s selfish, uncomprehending father.Conductor Stuart Stratford demonstrates masterly control of the ambitious score, while the City of London Sinfonia play superbly for him. The Opera Holland Park Chorus, meanwhile, have one of their great evenings."

Here he returns to the title role of Nabucco in the production by Daniele Abbado that he starred in when it was new four years ago.While there’s no use pretending that his voice shows no signs of ageing, he doesn’t need to sound young as Nebuchadnezzar – Nabucodonosor in Verdi’s biblical opera, or Nabucco for short; indeed there’s a Lear-like quality to his rough-edged portrayal of the Babylonian king who offends the god of the Israelites and is punished with madness.Still offering vigour and character, his voice continues to allow him to give an appreciable performance in the part. On the first night, he had momentary recourse to the prompter.
Around him the cast is solid rather than special, though Ukrainian soprano Liudmyla Monastyrska delivers the challenging role of Nabucco’s power-hungry foster-daughter Abigaille with confidence and flexibility.Making her debut with the Royal Opera, American mezzo Jamie Barton seizes her lyrical opportunities as Nabucco’s true offspring Fenena. Jean-Francois Borras gives a decent but unexciting account of her Jewish beloved Ismaele, while John Relyea makes a reasonably effective Zaccaria.Designed by Alison Chitty, Abbado’s grey-on-grey staging remains a static affair that stifles the personal drama at the heart of the piece, though some of its broader visual references – exiled 20th-century groups, including Jewish refugees from the Nazi period, and Daniel Liebeskind’s Holocaust Memorial in Berlin – remain indelibly eloquent. The problem is that Abbado makes it hard to tell the Israelites and the Babylonians apart.Maurizio Benini returns to conduct a performance more dignified than thrilling, but there’s some wonderful singing from the chorus in the iconic Va, pensiero"

Up to the interval, Boyd plays things relatively straight in Tom Piper’s handsome and adaptable period designs. But following Onegin’s killing of his friend Lensky in a pointless duel – itself cleverly wrong-footing the audience into initially thinking that Onegin has died – the central character is haunted by his dead friend, now dressed as a woman.It’s a provocative gesture, yet part of a realisation that undoubtedly makes you think as well as responding deeply to the emotional turmoil the central characters go through and whose musical representation is so expertly conveyed by Douglas Boyd, the increasingly impressive Garsington Opera Orchestra and its fine young chorus.Always an exceptional artist, Roderick Williams rises to new heights as Onegin, bringing moment-by-moment conviction to his portrayal of the haughty loner who throws his chance of happiness away. Singing with confidence and grace, Welsh soprano Natalya Romaniw embodies finely both the uncertain young Tatyana of the opening scenes and the mature woman of the opera’s close. Brindley Sherratt brings dignity and heartfelt bass tone to her elderly husband, Prince Gremin. Ukrainian tenor Oleksiy Palchykov makes an ardent, vocally thrilling Lensky. All of the secondary role go well, with Mark Wilde offering sensitivity and charm in his cameo appearance as Monsieur Triquet."

Even the productions revived here – rehearsed by Sarah Crisp from original stagings by Elijah Moshinsky whose costume designer is for some reason no longer credited – are twenty years old.But the ultra-traditional Cavalleria, in particular, could be a straight reproduction of something far more ancient. Acting values are mixed and at times unconvincing, getting the evening off to a weak dramatic start.Vocally things go better, with both Gwyn Hughes Jones and David Kempster solid as Turiddu and Alfio, though for all-round excellence one must turn to Rebecca Afonwy-Jones’s butter-wouldn’t-melt Lola and Anne-Marie Owens’s fraught Mamma Lucia.Pagliacci is the stronger show – though even here the usually infallible play-within-a-play sequence would work better if the set was re-angled to face the audience in the auditorium, rather than the one on stage.Neither the climactic double onstage murder nor the devastating final line “La commedia e finita!” (“The comedy has ended!”) sends any shivers down the spine – as they unquestionably should.Creating positive impressions, though, are Meeta Raval’s fresh-toned but impassioned Nedda and Gyula Nagy’s lyrical yet dynamic Silvio. Hughes Jones and Kempster once again deliver capable readings of Nedda’s brutal husband Canio and her vengeful, rejected would-be seducer Tonio respectively.Experienced conductor Carlo Rizzi, who has served the company as a skilled music director for two periods in its history, leads performances in which its accomplished orchestra and chorus are on focused form; but taken as a whole neither show represents WNO anywhere near its best."

For his ambitious new work, he has secured the rights to turn Sarah Kane’s final play into an opera.The play’s own history – it was completed shortly before the writer’s suicide in February 1999 – will inevitably colour responses to his piece as much as the original work itself.Kane does not list characters or assign individual lines to one speaker or another. Venables has chosen to set the text for six female singers plus an orchestra of 12 players – here the specialist new-music ensemble Chroma performing under the expert baton of conductor Richard Baker.Almost nothing has been cut from Kane’s text. The spoken word has regularly been one of Venables’ preoccupations, and here passages are not only sung or spoken but also chanted by members of the cast as a group, or even just whispered or shouted.Venables’ most startling technical innovation occurs when a doctor/patient conversation is projected on to the set while also being performed purely in speech rhythm by two percussionists. At such moments, the surprising humour hidden in Kane’s text is brilliantly underlined.Elsewhere, Venables includes manic instrumental interludes – “nasty fucked-up computer game music”, as the score describes them – passages of ‘elevator music’ of the kind you might encounter in a hospital waiting room, and specific references to the Baroque period. The result is a wide-ranging stylistic melange that counterpoints the freewheeling intellectual sophistication and through-the-floor psychological depths reached in Kane’s play.Hannah Clark’s sparse designs and Ted Huffman’s unfussy production both focus attention on the individual performances, either in solo scenes or in interactions that are virtually choreographic in their detail and expressive power. The six singers do not disappoint in their outstanding contributions to an immensely moving piece."

He wrote just the one opera, over a period of 20 years between 1910 and 1930; it eventually made its debut in Paris in 1936. There haven’t been many revivals, though there’s been a bit more interest of late. Staged by members of the Catalan theatrical collective La Fura dels Baus, this co-production with Brussels and Paris represents its first staging at Covent Garden.The piece is a French-language setting of the Oedipus story in a lengthy, birth-to-death version that includes all the well-known episodes spread over four substantial acts.Enescu’s style is an uneasy blend of late romanticism with modernist touches. Unfortunately there are few memorable ideas – the score has a tendency to meander endlessly without ever really getting to the point.Alex Olle’s staging begins with the unforgettable image of the principals and expanded chorus standing motionless on a vast structure rising through four levels to the full height of the proscenium arch. Lluc Castell’s mostly mud-coloured costumes blend ancient Greece with modern military fatigues, the uncertain times in which Oedipus lived and died reflected in the tensions of more recent periods.The problem is that many of these images have long been cliches of contemporary opera staging, their impact diminished through over-repetition. The result is a gloomy spectacle scarcely enlivened even by the mystifying appearance of Marie-Nicole Lemieux’s Sphinx as the pilot of a Spitfire.Led by Johan Reuter’s tireless Oedipus, a hardworking cast does everything it can but the material is musically dull and visually unrewarding. Sarah Connolly presents a glamorous Jocaste. John Tomlinson’s Tiresias sounds desperately worn. Talented conductor Leo Hussain highlights subtleties in the score, but he is unable to give it the dramatic vitality it so fatally lacks."

The work carries topical resonances in terms of outsider integration and a defence of ‘sacred German art’ against foreign intruders, but David McVicar’s resetting of the action – from medieval to post-Napoleonic Nuremberg – outlines the nationalistic undertones without voicing the worst of them. The ornate, deep-vaulted ceiling of the church dominates Vicki Mortimer’s sets, deftly lit with intense, side-on sunlight by Paule Constable.Gerald Finley is exceptional in humanising the cobbler-poet Hans Sachs’ predicament of protecting the old guard while accepting the new, the resulting strain almost ever-present in his furrowed brow. The voice is not overwhelming in heft but the payback is an intimacy that is utterly convincing. Amanda Majeski’s Eva is a little unnatural in her acting and lacks vocal bloom, but David Portillo is thrillingly youthful and alert as Sachs’ happy-go-lucky apprentice David. Alistair Miles is assured if not vocally imposing as the goldsmith Pogner, and shows touching affection for Eva in Act II. Jochen Kupfer’s physical command as a vain, slippery but hilarious Beckmesser is remarkable. McVicar’s crowd scenes teem with colour and detail, and Michael Guttler balances the passionate and the ceremonial in the pit, also revealing fetching, aptly nocturnal, half-lights in the music of Act II."

Her additional trio of actors may be extraneous and in some guises confusing, but their appearances as removal men are genuinely funny.All of the principal performances possess quality. US tenor Taylor Stayton bounces around nimbly as Count Almaviva, though his tone is apt to be metallic and his coloratura patchy. An ideal exponent of the comic bass role of Dr Bartolo, Alessandro Corbelli sings and acts with flawless skill and discrimination.Danielle de Niese misses no opportunities as Rosina, her acting as imaginative and accomplished as her singing. She’s allowed an additional aria Rossini wrote for a later revival of the piece. While it gets in the way dramatically, she performs it very nicely.Christophoros Stamboglis serves up a grandly voiced, gently humorous Don Basilio, while Janis Kelly makes something of a showstopper out of her cleverly vocalised, wittily acted account of efficient housekeeper Berta’s aria.The evening’s star, though, is the young German baritone Bjorn Burger, whose bright and brilliant tone is matched by equivalent stage personality to position his Figaro, quite properly, at the epicentre of the whirlwind action.The London Philharmonic Orchestra is in the pit, offering spruce and vital playing under conductor Enrique Mazzola, who presents every number from the overture to the Act II finale with exemplary character and point."

Eleven years after its premiere, it still packs an almighty punch.On this occasion, this is partly due to the presence in the pit of conductor Sir Richard Armstrong, who conveys both the grandest overview of Puccini’s emotion-laden score as well as the fineness of its most intimate details. ENO’s orchestra plays superbly for him.But the production has strong visual credentials, too, including several moments of sheer and unforgettable beauty. Choa’s choreography and the intricate work of the puppeteers of Blind Summit Theatre offer authentic Japanese counterpoints to the opera’s Western elements, embodying the irreconcilable culture-clash at its heart, while revival director Sarah Tipple misses nothing in her traversal of its inescapable narrative trajectory.This revival is fortunate in its cast, too. Soprano Rena Harms maintains consistent expressive power as well as beauty of tone throughout the exhaustingly lengthy challenge of the title role. David Butt Philip offers exciting tenor singing and a resourcefully convincing exploration of the craven Pinkerton. Mezzo Stephanie Windsor-Lewis makes an auspicious company debut as Suzuki, demonstrating the centrality of this crucial supporting role. Baritone George von Bergen brings gravitas to Consul Sharpless.Vital secondary roles – Matthew Durkan’s dignified Yamadori, Mark Richardson’s terrifying Bonze – achieve their proper impact. Samantha Price uncovers a great deal in her brief but telling appearance as Kate Pinkerton.The Bunraku puppet portraying Butterfly’s child Sorrow remains the show’s most idiosyncratic element, but so skilful are its operators that their work underscores rather than undermines the fatal potency of Puccini’s devastating musical drama."

Bostridge’s voice may be a controversial and in some respects limited instrument, lacking the ideal lyricism and richness of colour possessed by the greatest of Schubert interpreters, yet his knowledge of and expertise in this particular piece – on which he published a substantial volume two years ago – is outstanding, and at his best there is no gainsaying the expressive impact of his performance.Zender’s approach is interventionist, not merely expanding Schubert’s piano accompaniment to an orchestra of some 20 players – here the Britten Sinfonia, expertly conducted by Baldur Bronnimann – but complicating it with additions, rewrites and contradictions that give it a distinctly modern feel.Jones’ visualisation is monochrome in tone but wide-ranging in mood and imagery, referencing during its traversal of barren, snowbound woods and fields both Expressionism and the cabaret of the Weimar period: in his evening wear Bostridge sometimes looks like a refugee Emcee mislaid from a production of Cabaret.Like his vocalism, the tenor’s acting skills are idiosyncratic yet intermittently powerful. The result is an uneven 90 minutes, but at best it achieves moments of genuine greatness."

A former Young BBC Musician of the Year – he’s an exceptional clarinettist – Simpson is also making an increasing name for himself as a composer. Setting a libretto by Melanie Challenger, his new work, Pleasure, derives from his experiences of Liverpool’s club scene in his late teens and early 20s.Avoiding the more obvious operatic potential of the club’s bars or dancefloor, and with only brief interventions by a recorded offstage chorus, Pleasure (named after the club itself) is a chamber piece for just four principals and an orchestra of 10 players, here represented by members of the excellent Manchester-based new-music ensemble Psappha, cannily conducted by Nicholas Kok.It comes at its setting via something of an angle. The first character we meet – mature, maternal Val, convincingly sung by soprano Lesley Garrett – is the lady who looks after the loos, and also provides a shoulder for young men to cry on; her hard-bitten, abrasive colleague is drag queen Anna Fewmore, given some salty pizzazz by baritone Steven Page. Val offers practical relationship advice to innocent young Matthew (tenor Nick Pritchard) about handsome Nathan (baritone Timothy Nelson), with whom he is aiming to get off.Yet the piece becomes ever darker. Val recognises Nathan as her lost son by a brutal father, while he seems confused about both himself and his sexuality; eventually, haunted by memories of his violent childhood, he takes an overdose. Sadly, the libretto’s steadily downwards trajectory doesn’t feel either satisfying or convincing.Simpson’s rich, complex and well-paced score nevertheless shows real operatic potential that one feels could blossom fully given a stronger dramatic foundation. The individual performances are all worthwhile, Tim Albery’s production solidly crafted, and Leslie Travers’ designs genuinely clever."

Colourful and imaginative, the result is visually resplendent, with some particularly glamorous costumes.Individual performances are strong, melding into a unified company whose routines will doubtless attain sharper definition as the run proceeds.A literal one-man-band of a wandering minstrel, Nicholas Sharratt’s silly-ass Nanki-Poo achieves an endearingly Wodehousian quality. Rebecca Bottone makes an appealingly knowing Yum-Yum. A balefully Gothic woman in black, Rebecca de Pont Davies’s rejected Katisha is an unforgettable comic creation. Ben McAteer’s sexually ambivalent Pish-Tush is good fun too.The lead comic roles, though, are in the experienced hands of the indispensable Suart and Andrew Shore as Pooh-Bah – the latter offering a classic account of the ultimate snob who claims he was born sneering.
Stephen Richardson revels in Gilbert’s ghoulish humour as the Mikado. Sioned Gwen Davies (Pitti-Sing) and Emma Kerr (Peep-Bo) provide Bottone with keen support as the other two of the three little maids.Vocal and musical values are high, with Sullivan’s enchanting score well served by the large chorus and hand-picked orchestra under Derek Clark’s focused baton."
278,"HMS Pinafore review at Hackney Empire, London – ‘funny and peppy’",https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2016/hms-pinafore-review-at-hackney-empire-london/,HMS Pinafore,Hackney Empire,London,4,2016-04-28,George Hall,"First seen in 2013, Sasha Regan’s celebrated all-male production of the Gilbert and Sullivan classic HMS Pinafore returns for a national tour. It’s scaled down: musical director Richard Bates does heroic work at the keyboard, conjuring up a spirited account of Sullivan’s orchestral score, while the company’s eight-strong ensemble supplies the members of the vessel’s manly crew as well as transmuting into a small posse of Sir Joseph Porter’s unquenchable sisters, cousins and aunts.Pinafore was the comic opera duo’s first international hit, and remains one of the most popular of the entire series. Nearly 140 years after its 1878 premiere, Gilbert’s absurdist satire on the English class system feel as pertinent as ever. Sullivan’s score is an equally classy piece of work.It’s impossible to know what the creators might have made of an all-male version, but as sophisticated men of the theatre my guess is that they would have relished the cleverness of the individual characterisations and the show’s energy, with the crew’s acrobatic routines as choreographed by Lizzi Gee getting the evening off to a flying start.And Sullivan would surely have been amazed at the skill with which those cast members singing female roles consistently deliver the falsetto goods; this is a show that is as finely sung as it is acted.It also proves surprisingly moving. When Tom Senior’s upright Ralph Rackstraw is rejected by Ben Irish’s haughty Josephine due to his lower-class status, one feels for him. Neil Moors makes a suitably bumptious Captain Corcoran, David McKechnie an exotically glamorous Little Buttercup and Michael Burgen an aptly preposterous Sir Joseph.Such strong standouts lead a company with no weak links. The dialogue has pep, and each and every musical number hits the spot. Gilbert and Sullivan fans should not hesitate, while those not yet converted should give it a try."
279,Tannhauser review at Royal Opera House – ‘outstanding’,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2016/tannhauser-review-at-royal-opera-house/,Tannhauser,Royal Opera House – ‘outstanding’,Tannhauser review at Royal Opera House,4,2016-04-27,George Hall,"The curtain rises to reveal a second, smaller but otherwise identical proscenium arch and curtain upon the Royal Opera House stage. When it opens, a series of well-heeled gentlemen watch the female dancers as they commence the Bacchanale in the opening Venusberg scene, and then join in.Visually, Jasmin Vardimon’s erotic choreography for this lengthy ballet sequence, wonderfully executed by 12 dancers, is one of the best things about the revival of Tim Albery’s 2010 production. By the time Tannhauser has left the hedonistic domain of the goddess Venus and returned to the conventional court of the Landgrave of Thuringia, the proscenium arch is in ruins, while the courtiers look impoverished and menacing.Despite such strong imagery, it’s no easier this time around to work out exactly what Albery is trying to say about Wagner’s early opera, but there can be no doubt at all about the quality of the evening’s musical performance, which is outstanding.At the age of 62, veteran Heldentenor Peter Seiffert still commands the notes and the sheer stamina to get through the arduous title role, and then some. Baritone Christian Gerhaher’s Wolfram is delivered with the finesse of one of today’s greatest Lieder exponents; you will never hear the role better sung. Danish bass Stephen Milling is a tower of strength as the Landgrave, and Sophie Koch makes an alluring Venus.But it’s Emma Bell who offers what one must acknowledge as a star-is-born moment – though that should come as no surprise to anyone who saw her marvellous Elsa in WNO’s Lohengrin back in 2013. As Elisabeth, she sings with a depth and power that point her in the direction of a full-scale dramatic soprano.Hartmut Haenchen conducts an interpretation notable for its fluidity, and which sees both orchestra and chorus on top form. Whatever the meaning of the staging, this is an evening of great Wagnerian music-making."

The Greener’s job, within the tower’s industrial mechanism, is to run the clock – which in turn drives the ‘sweaters’ in the local workhouses. A gentleman Author, on a visit to study the great unwashed, falls in love with the Greener and sets about trying to release her from her plight.The design has clearly been a priority and it’s suitably striking, with an array of cogs complemented by further mechanics brought to life in animated illustrations. There are some very strong performances too, with Keisha Atwell giving her all as the Greener transcending her conditions – she has a gift and passion for astronomy. Dickon Gough as the cockney overseer, Coster, has a rich and pliable bass voice, and Adam Temple-Smith as the well-to-do, somewhat naive Author, sports a pure yet vibrant English tenor sound.Despite the efforts of the cast the characters feel roughly hewn, and there’s a mismatch between the occasionally exaggerated musical theatre performance style of Atwell and the remainder of the cast, who are come from the classical world. Martin Ward’s fairly bland score is inoffensive but fails to engage with, let alone propel, the drama of Clocks 1888 – as if it has been consigned to facelessness on the factory floor."

Katie Mitchell’s new production seems equally unlikely to outlast its initial run.Lucia is a grandly Gothic tale of forced marriage, murder and madness. In Vicki Mortimer’s detailed designs, the period is updated to the early Victorian period, more or less coinciding with the opera’s premiere.The Royal Opera has given Mitchell’s staging a health warning to the effect that ‘this production contains scenes of sex and violence’ – elements which, given the opera’s plot, are not really that surprising. Perhaps the fact that Mitchell’s production of Sarah Kane’s Cleansed is playing concurrently at the National Theatre may have added to the company’s concerns.In any event there was a good deal of booing for the production team at their curtain call. Much of this is surely down to Mitchell’s split screen approach, whereby the audience sees not only the characters meant to be singing at any given moment, but what is happening simultaneously offstage. The effect is hugely distracting.As the wedding guests (presented, curiously, as all male) celebrate Lucia’s nuptials with Arturo to one side of the stage, to the other we witness Lucia and Alisa kill him in what is clearly a premeditated attack. His death throes are so protracted as to generate laughter – no mean feat is this unrelievedly sombre piece.In the final scene, Edgardo’s mourning for his lost love is counterpointed by Lucia slitting her wrists in her bathtub. She has already miscarried with (presumably) their child, following a brief physical encounter in the first act that deserves to win the production a bad sex award.Alisa’s small role, incidentally – skilfully played by Rachael Lloyd – is bulked up throughout the evening. In addition, the ghosts of Lucia’s dead mother and a local girl murdered by one of Edgardo’s ancestors are almost omnipresent; frankly, there is far too much of all three.The overall result feels fussy and overwrought, with none of the clarity or focus that marked Mitchell’s work on George Benjamin’s Written on Skin three years ago.Not enough of the evening is special vocally, either. Diana Damrau delivers all of Lucia’s notes, but her voice is limited in colour, size and expression. Charles Castronovo’s Edgardo is clean-edged and has some finesse, but he lacks star quality, though he seizes his opportunities in the final scene as best he can despite being upstaged. The most impressive of the principals is Ludovic Tezier’s bullying Enrico – a Victorian villain to a T. Kwangchul Youn delivers an expert Raimondo, Taylor Stayton a decent Arturo. Conductor Daniel Oren is efficient without being exciting, so that not enough of the music-making grabs the attention."

It is certainly different to the show’s last West End outing at the Harold Pinter Theatre in 2008, which had only a company of actor-musicians.While some may frown that ENO resources and subsidy are being employed to service what is essentially a commercial venture – with opera-scale pricing of up to £150 a ticket – the venture has integrity and musical rigour.The original 1993 London world premiere of the show famously ditched its original star Patti LuPone for Glenn Close a year later for its Broadway premiere. This bona fide movie star, who had originated the show in LA, brought an authentic Hollywood allure to the fabled story as the once famous Norma Desmond desperately seeks a comeback.Now Close is part of the revival, 22 years after she won a Tony award for the role. As Norma Desmond herself might put it, this is not so much a comeback as a return; in the interim, she’s hardly been idle. This is being billed as her West End debut, though she previously appeared on the London stage in a 2002 production of A Streetcar Named Desire at the National Theatre, playing Blanche DuBois.Close is also no stranger to musicals: she was Tony nominated in 1980 for her supporting role in the original production of Barnum and also featured in the short-lived 1976 Richard Rodgers musical Rex opposite Nicol Williamson. Her vocal instrument may not be as sharp as it once was, nor she could ever compete with LuPone in the coloratura stakes, even in 1994, but she brings an utterly ferocious intensity to the part and the songs.She is sensationally paired here with Michael Xavier, who has steadily ascended the ranks of leading men in the West End to occupy the top rung, and who, in a second-act curtain-raiser, emerges out of a pool in just swimming trunks to prove that he still has the youthful appeal that he once brought to Sky in Mamma Mia!. Xavier plays the aspiring screenwriter who finds himself drawn into a fatally co-dependent relationship with the much older Norma, yet also falls for Siobhan Dillon’s sweetly voiced Betty Shaeffer.Director Lonny Price’s production, on simple series of interconnecting metal stairways, gives it momentum and drama. Don Black and Christopher Hampton’s book lacks humour, but their lyrics occasionally come to the rescue."

Venues for this latest venture range from the London Museum of Water and Steam in Brentford to the Brewery Arts Centre, Kendal; press night was staged in a claustrophobic concrete bunker beneath the Carousel bar near Baker Street.Until now, Pop-up has stuck to operatic comedies, a sure way for audiences to feel like they’re having a good time. It’s harder to make allowances for makeshift production values in serious drama. Director James Hurley’s take on the Romeo and Juliet tragedy is reworked, plausibly, as a modern-day mafia war (Bellini’s 1830 opera, based on 16th century Italian sources rather than Shakespeare, lends itself well to this), and there are some touching, as well as tense, moments – especially when guns are wielded.Too often, though, the acting feels emptily earnest, and Bellini’s trouser-role Romeo is incongruous at close quarters. Hammily mimed overtures and entr’acts are redundant when the score is rendered throughout solely on thin electronic keyboard – well-played as it is by Music Director Berrak Dyer. With a bit of tightening up this has the potential to be a far more compelling experience.Unlike similar outfits such as Opera Up Close, Pop-up commendably sings in original languages, with projected translations which are easy to follow (but sometimes unintentionally titter-inducing: ‘That asshole’s gonna marry Giulietta’ is particularly glaring), while Bellini’s full-blooded bel canto is tackled respectably by the young cast."

The angular, brittle vocal writing, with singers often yelling at the top of their ranges, and the shotgun syllabic setting in the hectic first scene brilliantly underline the artificiality of the characters in this comedy of manners.Oddly, the shadow of Beethoven looms large (Lady Bracknell and Miss Prism offer their own settings of Schiller’s Ode to Joy), as does the tune of Auld Lang Syne, which appears in crude interjections.The spat between Gwendolen and Cecily, as they apparently discover they are both engaged to the same “Ernest”, is coloured aggressively by the smashing of plates, pistol shots and the stomping of jackboots. Throughout, the show’s manic, random quality is achieved by very precise means, just as the most withering remarks in Wilde’s text are written by a needlepoint.A virtuoso explosion from beginning to end, The Importance of Being Earnest is a tour de force for the cast, which mostly returns from the Royal Opera’s 2013 production. Tenor Paul Curievici proves equal to Barry’s cruelly agile vocal lines and adds comic flair. Alan Ewing, as the pinstripe-suited (and, yes, male) Lady Bracknell, remains imperious amid all the nonsense.Hilary Summers is endearing in the character role of the governess Prism, and Claudia Boyle makes an impressive Royal Opera debut, achieving the stratospheric vocal heights demanded of Cecily. The energy of the singers is matched, even driven, by the pin-sharp Britten Sinfonia, conducted by Tim Murray."

Less common are arias and less common still choruses of performers who have experienced homelessness singing Bach.Taking place in Manchester’s Campfield Market, The Passion is the culmination of a year-long collaborative programme of workshops between The Sixteen and Streetwise Opera. An abridged staging of J.S. Bach’s St Matthew Passion, the opera begins with the chorus entering in the back of a truck and crossing the space through the congregated audience in thick outdoor coats and woollies. These clothes are soon swapped for more traditional signifiers of Roman Judea: robes, shawls and a choir of Pharisees. The role of Jesus is shared between multiple performers throughout the performance, the music combining with Imitating the Dog’s artful live projection and light direction and the Victorian ironwork of the market.Though abridged, Bach’s masterwork loses none of its potency; tenor Joshua Ellicott unfailingly carries the narrative with standout performances also coming as Jesus is sentenced to death on the cross, from Kirsty Hopkins’ soprano and Alexandra Jakeman’s flute on the Aus Liebe will mein Heiland sterben aria. The finale takes the form of a new composition by James MacMillan, with libretto written by the Streetwise Opera Manchester Explore Group: a joyous resurrection capping a production which provides solid evidence that social outreach need not exist solely at the fringes of the arts."

Conductor Antonio Pappano and director Richard Jones make an unassailable case for it.The star is naturally Bryn Terfel, taking the role of the guilt-tormented, child-murdering Tsar for the first time. It’s a role usually associated with a full bass – Terfel’s great predecessors at this address include Boris Christoff, Nicolai Ghiaurov and John Tomlinson – while Terfel is a bass-baritone; but his performance is nevertheless extraordinary in its depth and detail, providing an entirely worthy centrepiece.He’s surrounded by a fine cast who memorably individualise the other characters. David Butt Philip presents the Pretender who eventually succeeds Boris with strength and initiative. Ain Anger is engrossing as the old chronicler monk, Pimen. John Graham-Hall suggests the cunning of the Tsar’s adviser, Shuisky. Now singing the drunken monk Varlaam, Tomlinson once again commands full attention.Miriam Buether’s complex set presents an upper level on which the murder of young Dmitry is repeated again and again in Boris’s febrile imagination. The final gesture – Boris’s young son Fyodor (finely performed by Ben Knight) mortally menaced by the victorious Pretender – provides an unforgettable distorted-mirror image.Aided by movement director Ben Wright, Jones presents the vital crowd scenes as effectively as the intimate moments focussing on Boris and his family. The result is one of the finest things he has done at the Royal Opera House, matched by music-making of equal distinction."

The visual inspiration for director Lloyd Wood’s production of Mozart’s dark-toned comedy is the underworld of Vienna around 1900, as recorded in the writings of the investigative journalist Max Winter. He chronicled the seamier side of the capital in its imperial era – the lives of the lower classes, and those even better hidden from the day-to-day gaze of the well-to-do.The result is striking, placing the opera’s high-born characters in finely made suits and fashionable dresses, while the lower orders – Giovanni’s manservant Leporello, and the peasant couple Masetto and Zerlina – are a good deal less smart in appearance. Since much of Giovanni’s behaviour depends on his innate class advantages and sense of entitlement, this offers useful insights into the piece.It’s also notable that George von Bergen’s Giovanni and Matthew Stiff’s Leporello are sufficiently physically alike for them to swap clothes and identities at one point, underlining that, in a class sense, clothes really do make the man.Throughout, Von Bergen is entirely credible as the suave and sophisticated multiple seducer/rapist and killer, though the tendency for his voice to wander away from the notes he’s aiming at remains disconcerting. Stiff’s Leporello sustains an earthy vitality.Camilla Roberts makes a strikingly powerful Donna Anna, partnered by the unusually firm Don Ottavio of Robyn Lyn Evans. Ania Jeruc emphasises the passionate instability of Donna Elvira, while Bradley Travis and Lucy Hall are entirely convincing as Masetto and Zerlina.Taken as a whole, the show coheres impressively, even if the hellfire of the final scene feels surprisingly muted for one of opera’s biggest finishes. But conductor Michael Rosewell ensures that a sense of musical drama keeps the piece constantly on the move."

The purgatorial connection is fitting: neither heavenly, nor hellish, the opera is a solid but unmoving piece.Nor does ETO offer much justification for blowing the dust off the score. It’s an occasionally rousing bit of bel canto frippery, in which the warring Guelphs and Ghibellines are uneasily united by the marriage of Pia and Nello. Except Nello’s cousin Ghino also loves Pia and, after being rebuffed by her, he tells Nello that she’s cheating on him.The production’s two great strengths are baritone Grant Doyle’s powerful performance as Nello, and the design. Boards like office partitions make it look as if the set has been turned around so the audience sees its back. To suit the opera’s tragic scenes, designer Loren Elstein has employed a murky colour palette, gloomily illuminated by Guy Hoare’s yellow and orange lighting. The result is like a sky before it fractures with a fierce storm – ever-changing, blackening and bruised.But this unsettling set sits strangely with the costumes. Dressed as dowdy peasant extras from Game of Thrones, the chorus stand in mostly static clumps under James Conway’s direction. This gives the four principals plenty of space and focus, but makes for prolonged moments of inertia.Like tenor Luciano Botelho’s restrained voice, the production lacks power when it is needed. Although lovingly assembled from the many versions that Donizetti left behind, and powerfully supported by the orchestra under John Andrews, overall it doesn’t pack much of a punch."

Based on Euripides, Iphigenie en Tauride continues the story of Gluck’s earlier opera Iphigenie en Aulide.About to be sacrificed by her father Agamemnon to aid the Greek war effort against Troy, Iphigenie is spirited away to her temple at Tauris by the goddess Diana. There, many years later, Iphigenie’s brother Oreste and his friend Pylade come upon her, neither initially recognising the other. How he in turn escapes sacrifice at his sister’s hand is the subject of the almost unrelievedly sombre drama.It’s often considered Gluck’s masterpiece, and the dramatically engaged conducting of Martin Andre plus the committed playing of ETO’s substantial orchestra make a good case for it. So does the narrative clarity of James Conway’s production, presented in stark but effective designs by Anna Fleischle.Less convincing in some respects is the singing, with one or two performers not really fielding voices of the strength or quality required for their demanding assignments. Mezzo-soprano Catherine Carby, however, successfully conveys the ongoing torment of the heroine until fate eventually smiles upon her in the shape of the goddess Diana, here bravely presented by young Pepper Cometti.Baritone Grant Doyle, too, though he shouts more than he needs to at moments of stress, emphasises the mental torture suffered by Iphigenie’s brother Oreste, another victim of the ancient curse on his family."

Set in present-day Denmark it concerns the students of Class 7D, who have just returned to school after the summer holiday. One of them, Pierre, declares that nothing means anything and retreats to a plum tree. His classmates attempt to prove him wrong by creating a ‘pile of meaning’ in an abandoned sawmill, giving up some of their favourite possessions which they intend to set on fire. After Pierre challenges them instead to determine each other’s sacrifices, there begins a spiral of increasingly extreme actions fuelled by peer pressure and mob dynamics.Bruces’ music combines folk and Renaissance overtones with shifting effects which seem to reflect the teenagers searching for their own paths, and there are some remarkably touching moments of sparseness. Giles Cadle’s smart set revolves to show the school, the sawmill and the plum tree in which Pierre sits – the last a pixelated design, perhaps suggesting a possible ‘virtual’ space from which Pierre influences his classmates (though there is some crucifix symbolism too). Director Bijan Sheibani makes every action and interaction count and manages to make a success of a largely static Pierre, radiantly sung by Stuart Jackson. Marta Fontanals-Simmon’s Ursula and counter-tenor James Hall’s Johan are also striking performances.Nothing is a bold statement, not only in its questions of material possession, sacrifice, group behaviour and moral boundaries – but also in not pretending to offer answers. It’s as moving, authentic and thought-provoking an opera you’re likely to see for some time."

While it was predictable that the mordant humour of Gianni Schicchi would suit his edgy style, his success in the dark thriller Il Tabarro and the intimate convent-based tragedy of Suor Angelica remains as unexpected as it is absolute. All three work the trick.Jones is lucky in his casts. As Michele, the uneasy, betrayed barge owner in Il Tabarro, Lucio Gallo provides doomy presence, yet later turns with effortless skill into the rapscallion Schicchi in the evening’s comic finale. Patricia Racette engages the heart as Michele’s desperate wife, Giorgetta, while Carl Tanner presents her bold young lover Luigi with conviction.Schicchi itself goes like clockwork, with the substantial cast comprising a strong ensemble team while including many standouts, with newcomer Sicilian tenor Paolo Fanale impressing as Rinuccio and UK soprano Susanna Hurrell as his girlfriend Lauretta. Seizing their moments in secondary parts are Elena Zilio’s priceless Zita, Tiziano Bracci as the canny Notary and veteran Gwynne Howell – still going strong at 77 – as local bigwig Simone.But it’s the central panel – Suor Angelica – that proves the most involving experience. With its tale of a nun who commits suicide when she learns of the death of her illegitimate son, it used to be regarded as overly sentimental; but you’d need to possess a heart of stone to resist the absolute identification with the part offered by Albanian soprano Ermonela Jaho, or the naked power of her confrontation with her unforgiving aunt, sung by Swedish contralto Anna Larsson. It is a performance not to be missed.In the pit, Nicola Luisotti conducts all three scores with an assured sense of style."

Together with Sue Blane’s wackily unhistorical costumes, the result is short on context but gets many of the belly laughs for which it clearly aims; yet we don’t have much idea of who Richard Wiegold’s grandly solid Don Basilio or Maltese light tenor Nico Darmanin’s Count Almaviva are meant to be, let alone where or when.In Blane’s costumes, Claire Booth’s soprano Rosina seems unnecessarily sexualised; her singing could be stronger, as could that of Nicholas Lester’s Figaro, who needs more definition and vitality to take centre stage, but Andrew Shore knows exactly how Dr Bartolo should go. Overall this is an evening of amiable tomfoolery, lifted to a higher level by the conducting of young James Southall.The Marriage of Figaro is the work of director Tobias Richter, who plays the piece in the unusual mixture of Blane’s period costumes within Koltai’s modernist metal sets. Mark Stone excels as the Count, a charismatic presence whose honed baritone commands attention, though Elizabeth Watts’ fraught Countess has a few awkward moments. Anna Devin makes a vocally neat Susanna, with David Stout a Figaro stronger in voice than in personality.Naomi O’Connell’s Cherubino sings sweetly, though she fails to suggest the maleness of her character. Richard Wiegold’s voluminous bass makes a strong impression as the elderly Dr Bartolo, consistently outflanked though he is by the more pro-active Marcellina of Susan Bickley. Lothar Koenigs conducts conscientiously.The season culminates in the world premiere production of Figaro Gets a Divorce, based by librettist/director David Pountney on Odon von Horvath’s 1936 play, and set to music by Russian-born Elena Langer. The central team of Mozartian characters, plus some new additions – notably Angelika (Rhian Lois) and Serafin (Naomi O’Connell), the innocent children of the world-weary older generation – are transferred into the uncertainties and insecurities of the 1930s, when they have become refugees. The narrative feels episodic and hard to follow, but Langer’s score has a good deal going for it: some genuine lyricism, rich harmonies, and gorgeous orchestration.Intervening strikingly in the action is the villainous figure of the blackmailing Major, played with memorable malice by Alan Oke, and that of the ambiguous Cherub, a nightclub owner who turns out to be the long-lost Cherubino, returned to life and delivered with some vocal flamboyance by counter-tenor Andrew Watts. Justin Brown conducts a fluent performance of an intriguing piece that leads some of opera’s most famous characters into a new context and a new century."

As an antidote, Unexpected Opera has condensed the cycle’s 16 hours down to around two, presenting key excerpts drawn together by a witty narrative, all playing out within the wider frame of the goings on at the café Patisserie Valkyrie.Simon Thorpe plays the scheming dwarf Alberich with a Brummie accent, Sieglinde’s abusive husband Hunding is a cockney, and Alberich’s son Hagen is performed in the style of Sean Connery. His ability to move effortlessly between comedy and drama is matched by Mari Wyn Williams, who sings heartily and also skilfully balances the burden of conflicting loyalties to Wotan and Siegmund with the banter back at the café. Harriet Williams impresses for her ample tone and Anna Gregory gets to fully take the stage only halfway through the third opera, Siegfried, while complaining of having to wear a revealing outfit as the Woodbird. Edward Hughes – as slow-witted Tim from the café – also amusingly plays the innocent forest child Siegfried.Kelvin Lim transfers both the scale and intimacy of Wagner’s score via a single piano, with remarkable power and finesse.The plot seems to spool forwards abruptly in one part of the final opera and the pacing of dialogue against sung excerpts is occasionally unbalanced, but this is an upbeat, entertaining show featuring a fine ensemble cast."
295,Norma review at the London Coliseum – ‘a triumph’,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2016/norma-review-at-the-london-coliseum-a-triumph/,Norma,the London Coliseum – ‘a triumph’,Norma review at the London Coliseum,4,2016-02-19,Edward Bhesania,"While leafleters outside the Coliseum campaigned to save the ENO chorus – threatened with operating full-time for only 75 per cent of the year following a cut in arts council funding – inside it was business as usual. But there is nothing mundane about Christopher Alden’s new production of Norma, the company’s first ever staging of Bellini.The druids of Roman-occupied ancient Gaul here become a mid-19th-century Puritan community, restrained in physical expression but insidiously violent in the way they handle their sickles and hoes. The priestess Norma’s spiritual connection to nature is symbolised by a huge tree spanning the depth of the stage. Spare, austere and ritualistic, the staging is highly effective, even if it sometimes seems at odds with the deep-rooted emotion that is part of Bellini’s score.Stephen Lord, musical director of Opera Theatre Saint Louis, deftly and lovingly uncovers layers of detail and dramatic expression. This distinguished music-making is matched by a consistently fine cast. Marjorie Owens makes a very impressive UK debut in the notoriously taxing title-role, with a powerful instrument that showed no sign of tiring. Perhaps even more remarkable is Jennifer Holloway’s Adalgisa – rich, even-toned and naturally resonant across her entire vocal range. Peter Auty combines tenor penetration with baritonal warmth as Pollione, and James Creswell creates undeniable impact as Norma’s father, Oroveso. The ENO chorus received its own mini-ovation. This show may be a triumph, but it’s also a reminder of what we might lose if ENO begins to compromise on artistic quality."
296,The Magic Flute review at the London Coliseum – ‘imaginative and beguiling’,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2016/the-magic-flute-review-at-the-london-coliseum-imaginative-and-beguiling/,The Magic Flute,the London Coliseum – ‘imaginative and beguiling’,The Magic Flute review at the London Coliseum,4,2016-02-08,Edward Bhesania,"Simon McBurney, co-founder of Complicite, chose Mozart’s Enlightenment-themed singspiel The Magic Flute as his second operatic venture (2013), after Raskatov’s A Dog’s Heart in 2010.Now in its first revival, it presents a striking freshness of approach, but the overall effect is of inspired touches than of a compelling overarching conception.We enter the darkness-to-light scenario from the position of light: house lights up, orchestral players raised up in the pit. The transparency continues as words and illustrations drawn on a blackboard, stage left, are projected onto a huge screen. The bird-catcher Papageno attracts a rush of puppeteers handling a flock of fluttering sheets of paper. Stage right, there’s a tiny booth in which sound effects are created live. Illusion and reality are intriguingly blurred, but their aim is unclear.The trial by water, where Tamino and Pamina float above the stage amid a swirling video effect, is mesmeric, as is the appearance of the Three Boys as three skeletal, wispy-haired yogi.The Queen of the Night, sung tenaciously by Canadian soprano Ambur Braid, arrives in a wheelchair, a sign of her waning power, even though she drives the contraption to menacing effect. John Graham-Hall creates an oleaginous, cockney Monostatos, but the high priest Sarastro is cast as the head of some corporate sect, calling into question our customary understanding of good and evil.Mark Wigglesworth approaches the score with broad stokes, full of space and breadth, but sometimes short on detail. The singing of the central pair, Allan Clayton’s Papageno and Lucy Crowe’s Pamina, is key to this revival’s success."
297,"L’Etoile at Royal Opera House, London – ‘dramatically slight’",https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2016/letoile-at-royal-opera-house-london-dramatically-slight/,"L’Etoile at Royal Opera House, London – ‘dramatically slight’",,London,3,2016-02-02,George Hall,"Even if my life depended on it, I’m not sure I could explain the plot of L’Etoile, an opera-bouffe by the minor but genuinely talented Emmanuel Chabrier, best known for his orchestral showpieces Espana and Joyeuse Marche.The Royal Opera stages his 1877 operetta for the first time in this production by Mariame Clement – who gave Glyndebourne a highly successful Don Pasquale in 2011, following up in 2015 with a respectable Poliuto.The piece’s weakness is the lack of an ongoing narrative thread leading the audience through its seemingly endless sequence of more or less comic situations.Even the addition of actors Chris Addison and Jean-Luc Vincent in the newly written spoken parts of Smith and Dupont scarcely makes anything clearer, deftly though both of them deliver their routines based on somewhat tired old French and English stereotypes. They are still among the evening’s better features.What makes L’Etoile just about worth doing is the music. Chabrier may have been a minor master, but he was a master all the same, and the technical skills exhibited in this lightweight piece are a cut above most scores of its kind; on the other hand, not many numbers really stick in the memory. Mark Elder conducts a neat and tidy performance but one that could do with more sheer esprit.Julia Hansen’s comic-oriental designs are fun. Everyone in the cast, both principals and chorus, works diligently to try to achieve lift-off, but the show’s energy runs out well before the second-act finale.The one performance with authentic star quality is that of American mezzo Kate Lindsey; she gives the young male pedlar Lazuli plenty of sex appeal, and sings with easy and mesmerising charm. But it still feels like a long evening."
298,"Found and Lost review at Corinthia Hotel, London – ‘a triumph of marketing’",https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2016/found-and-lost-review-at-corinthia-hotel-london-a-triumph-of-marketing/,Found and Lost,Corinthia Hotel,London,3,2016-01-28,George Hall,"Composer Emily Hall describes her site-specific, immersive work as an opera installation. In groups of a dozen the audience is guided around London’s vast and luxurious Corinthia Hotel, where a narrative involving a man and woman having an affair (played by Jesse Raiment and Tony Comley) is obliquely told. He is a CEO, she his mistress; they meet in Room 226, where eventually a crime is committed.It’s a small narrative that is surely deliberately not given a higher profile in a piece of theatre whose real star is the hotel itself. From the reception area, we move through the lobby, the Massimo restaurant, the flower shop, a business suite, even the boiler room.On the way, we coincide with the hotel’s real staff and its guests – some of the latter looking slightly bemused to find an opera taking place where they might have imagined themselves having no more than a quiet meal.Hall’s style has been described as a blend of classical and indie. The texts she sets have been developed by Matthew Welton from those found in the hotel – on menu cards, as instructions for a member of staff to check that a room is ready for occupation, information for checking a faulty boiler, lists of flowers, and so on.They’re set in a distanced, easy-on-the-ear manner that at times comes close to ambient music in the accompaniments. The solo singers and most of the instrumentalists are pre-recorded: cellist Oliver Coates and a small chorus made up of members of the choir Siglo de Oro are live.The result is pleasant and intriguing as a walk-around experience, even though it feels artistically slight. But as a marketing exercise for a business that has made a feature of having an artist-in-residence – Hall is the fourth – it’s surely rather brilliant."
299,The Devil Inside review at Theatre Royal Glasgow – ‘subtle and daring’,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2016/the-devil-inside-review-at-theatre-royal-glasgow-unsettling-and-evocative/,The Devil Inside,Theatre Royal Glasgow – ‘subtle and daring’,The Devil Inside review at Theatre Royal Glasgow,3,2016-01-25,Gareth K Vile,"Buoyed up by a small yet strong cast, and blessed with a scenic design that mirrors Louise Welsh’s austere libretto, The Devil Inside offers a metaphysical meditation on the dangerous line between ambition and addiction. Based on Robert Louis Stevenson’s story, The Devil Inside follows the consequences of a bargain with demonic power: in exchange for unlimited good fortune, a demon trapped inside a bottle will take the owner to hell, unless they are able to sell the bottle, at a lower price than was paid for it, before their death.Welsh’s subtle adaptation plays up the capitalist implications of the deal, with the protagonist James – played by Ben McAteer – using the gift to build a financial empire. Yet in this final act, as James and his wife attempt to escape the curse, a secondary theme – of love and self-sacrifice – overtakes the political dimensions in a fussy finale.The sparse, suggestive set – a bed, white curtains, a screen for shadow puppetry – remakes the action as a symbolic drama. Timeless and abstract, it brings out opera’s anti-naturalism and allows meditation on the consequences of desire.Stuart MacRae’s score is unsettling and evocative, encasing the performers in a sonic world of shadows and anxiety. While the sparse language occasionally reduces the physical performances to illustrations of the words, the music conjures an encroaching, disorientating menace. The last act is rushed and unsuccessfully tries to reconcile redemption with Faustian economics, yet this daring production expresses a distinctive Scottish identity."
300,"Andrea Chenier review at Grand Theatre, Leeds – ‘impressive’",https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2016/andrea-chenier-review-at-grand-theatre-leeds-impressive/,Andrea Chenier,Grand Theatre,Leeds,4,2016-01-20,George Hall,"In a season in which the company’s new work comprises just one major operatic production plus a couple of musicals, Opera North’s choice alights on the most successful score by Puccini’s younger contemporary, Umberto Giordano.Though his 1896 opera about the poet executed during the darkest days of the French Revolution possesses neither the finesse nor the structural conviction of a masterpiece by his better known rival, Giordano hits the nail on the head in terms of theatricality.Opera North’s cast makes a strong case for the piece. Rafael Rojas certainly seizes his opportunities as Chenier, a star part demanding vibrant Latin lyricism and fluent acting. He is convincingly partnered by Annemarie Kremer as Maddalena di Coigny, the aristocrat who falls in love with Chenier and elects to share his terrible fate. Getting near to their high standard is Robert Hayward as Gerard, the Coigny’s former servant turned revolutionary, though he lacks some of their sheer vocal opulence.Smaller roles abound in this action-packed opera. The company has persuaded several artists to double up, none more successfully than Fiona Kimm, who portrays a haughty but chic Countess di Coigny in Act I, following up in Act III with a touching account of Madelon, the elderly blind woman who offers up her only grandson to fight for the embattled revolutionary cause.Strong on narrative values, Annabel Arden’s production includes some purely sonic extras: in between scenes we hear the sounds of revolution and prison, as well as the voice of Chenier speaking his own verse. Joanna Parker’s plain sets, though, lack both atmosphere and a clear sense of location.But Oliver von Dohnanyi conducts a performance that shows Opera North’s orchestra on fine form, conveying the intermittent sweep of the patchy but regularly effective score."
301,Tosca review at the Royal Opera House – ‘Gheorghiu does not disappoint’,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2016/tosca-review-at-the-royal-opera-house-gheorghiu-does-not-disappoint/,Tosca,the Royal Opera House – ‘Gheorghiu does not disappoint’,Tosca review at the Royal Opera House,3,2016-01-11,George Hall,"Headlining the first of two casts offered in the current revival of Puccini’s thriller, Romanian diva Angela Gheorghiu returns to star in Jonathan Kent’s staging, for which she created the title role in 2006.Nine years on, her Tosca remains a force to be reckoned with, giving a performance delivered with dramatic insight and tonal nuance: she stops the show with her focused account of the famous Act 2 aria Vissi D’Arte. If there’s a touch of the kittenish about Gheorghiu’s demeanour elsewhere, at her best she dominates the evening.That’s partly because neither of the other two leads quite hits the spot. Italian tenor Riccardo Massi returns as her lover, Cavaradossi – he’s never less than competent, but his voice is not especially exciting and he’s an unengaging actor. Korean bass-baritone Samuel Youn is more notable as Tosca’s nemesis, Baron Scarpia, but he’s a crude villain, in places given to shouting rather than singing, and lacking the cool, cruel sophistication of Puccini’s sadistic charmer. Even so, the climactic second act Tosca-Scarpia confrontation generates considerable heat, with Emmanuel Villaume’s conducting – impressive both in its coherent overview and its attention to finer detail – driving the score along with passion as well as panache.Staff director Andrew Sinclair is in charge of the revival. It maintains solid dramatic standards, with some of the secondary roles – Donald Maxwell’s fussy Sacristan, Hubert Francis’s watchful spy Spoletta and Yuri Yurchuk’s constantly nervous political escapee Angelotti – particularly strong. But this is really Gheorghiu’s evening, and she does not disappoint."

It seems unfortunate that the news coincides with his weakest London show.Based on Pushkin’s verse novel, Tchaikovsky’s opera tells a straightforward but deeply involving tale of two individuals who love each other at different and the wrong times. Holten complicates this by having the protagonists doubled by dancers representing their younger selves: as well as experiencing the action directly, we also see it through the eyes of the characters when older.It’s an awkward arrangement that turns a perfect scenario into something cumbersome. Though the complex apparatus has been simplified, Michael Fabiano’s Lensky still lies dead at the front of the stage during the lengthy final scenes – as if the audience is incapable or remembering either his death in a duel or its significance. Throughout, meanwhile, the choral scenes are poorly handled. There’s some booing for Holten at the curtain call.There are genuine strengths, though, in individual performances. In the title role, Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky – who is currently undergoing treatment for a brain tumour – is magnificent vocally and dramatically. He receives an ovation.Australian soprano Nicole Car consolidates the positive impression she recently made as Micaela in Carmen with a superbly sung and acted Tatyana. Fabiano is an impassioned Lensky, Ferruccio Furlanetto a grandly toned and moving Prince Gremin. Conductor Semyon Bychkov knows how the score should go, and musically this is a strong evening – but I doubt whether the production will come back, and it doesn’t deserve to."

He won’t teach her the secrets of his trade, so she sets off to learn for herself, journeying into the deepest jungle to find the lair of the Fire-Fiend Razvani. Helping her survive the various trials of her adventure are her friend Chulak (Peter Kirk), ex-pirate Rambashi (Ross Ramgobin) and a love-sick, advertisement-covered white elephant called Hamlet (Tai Oney). Lila eventually returns home to find her father desperately needs her help to create the most magnificent firework display ever seen – cue a joyously rumbustious, spirit-lifting finale.John Fulljames’s pared-down production is unashamedly lo-tech, most of the action being conveyed via cheering colourful shadow puppetry designed by Steve Tiplady and Sally Todd. The immensely likeable cast play a large part in its success, as does David Bruce’s economic score – which, mirroring Pullman’s non-specific exotic setting, enchantingly combines eastern influences (pentatonics and gamalan timbres) with Western folksiness (an accordion supplies a salty tang). Conductor Alice Farnham and Chroma ensemble ensure plenty of zip.In marked contrast to panto hysterics, the gentle humour of The Firework-Maker’s Daughter offers genuine laughs around a core of substance, while its inventive, attractive, through-composed music and splendid un-miked voices provide a great introduction to opera for young people."

Happily, his second show for the company, the iron-clad double-bill known to opera fans as Cav and Pag, is a much worthier contribution to the local repertoire. Even so, the latter works considerably better than the former.Michieletto is not the first director to link the two operas, with their similar settings, by including the same characters and even the same singers in each: here beefy Latvian tenor Aleksandrs Antonenko takes on both Turiddu in Cavalleria and Canio in Pagliacci, bellowing his way through both, and vocally on the sharp side. Dramatically, he’s a good deal more convincing as Canio.Similarly, Greek baritone Dimitri Platanias appears as both Alfio in Cav and Tonio in Pag. Once again, he’s relentlessly loud, but his presence and dramatic strength see him through, especially in Leoncavallo’s opera. Meanwhile, Carmen Giannattasio, who sings and acts with real subtlety as Nedda, and (another Greek baritone) Dionysios Sourbis – an excellent Silvio – make necessarily silent appearances in Cav.In neither opera is Michieletto’s work with the chorus distinguished, and Paolo Fantin’s sets revolve too often and to insufficient purpose; but he conveys the increasing tensions of Pagliacci, and its final twenty minutes are edge-of-the-seat stuff.To a degree Cav is hampered by ordinary singing, not only from Antonenko but also from Eva-Maria Westbroek, who sings a blowsy Santuzza. But Martina Belli fleshes out sex-pot Lola perfectly and Elena Zilio is ideal casting as Mamma Lucia. Nevertheless, the evening’s first half is weak compared with what follows after the interval.Accomplished as always, Antonio Pappano’s conducting possesses a real sense of style, though there are a few moments when the choral ensemble is distinctly untidy."

It’s a remarkable achievement for a staging that has kept audiences happy year-in, year-out, and that shows no sign of faltering.At many of its performances – 156, in fact – long-term company member Richard Angas sang the title role. Sadly, he’s no longer with us and this series of performances is dedicated to his memory. Fortunately, veteran bass Robert Lloyd is around to take over, which he does with distinction, relishing Gilbert’s ghoulish text and singing Sullivan’s famous song  My Object All Sublime with a vocal quality matched throughout by the strong cast.Richard Suart returns with his classic Ko-Ko, which he remodels at every revival. As always, his ‘little list’ of those who would be better underground includes some topical names: this time, all the major party leaders are there, as is Sepp Blatter. He gives a brilliant comic performance.So does the entire ensemble. Mary Bevan sings a vocally immaculate, dramatically knowing Yum-Yum that would be impossible to better. Anthony Gregory is the dapper Nanki-Poo, entering into the silly-ass characterisation with aplomb and some charm. Yvonne Howard’s Katisha is sung with dignity and pathos as well as offering full comic value.The cut-class accents gild the satirical lily of Gilbert’s razor-sharp lines unnecessarily, and though young conductor Fergus Macleod – making his debut as the company’s Charles Mackerras Fellow – keeps the score nicely on the move, the overture seems to be cut more and more at every revival.These are minor cavils. It’s still a great show. Miller comes on at the end and gets a well-deserved ovation. As a piece of classy operatic entertainment, it’s irresistible."

David Pountney has produced an English translation of the composer’s own libretto, which is closely based on Max Frisch’s absurdist play concerning the petit-bourgeois Gottlieb Biedermann and his wife Babette who, out of middle-class politeness, embarrassment or just sheer spinelessness, end up putting up a pair of self-confessed arsonists in their attic. “Blinder than blind are the cowardly”, one of the arsonists observes: a truth borne out to the extreme by Biedermann who, unable to confront pyromaniac guests, goes as far as to lend them a match – with predictably explosive consequences.The Britten Sinfonia is deftly directed by Timothy Redmond, with the score’s nervous gestures, tolling bell and comical trombones often giving the air of a grotesque cabaret. A trio of bumbling firemen offers a Greek chorus commentary from their colourful play fire engine, but the only ones with any clue or plan are the double-act arsonists Schmitz (a former wrestler) and Eisenring (a former waiter, recently out of jail). Sung respectively by Leigh Melrose and Matthew Hargreaves, they make a stunning contribution – especially Melrose who, wearing a comic book tattooed muscle suit, combines the precision comic technique of Jean Dujardin with an unsettling, knowing glare.Mark Le Brocq perfectly captures the ineffectual Biedermann and, remarkably, never tires in vocal writing which continues to ascend as the character loses his grip on reality. Alinka Kozari and Raphaela Papadakis also give striking performances as Babette and the Biedermanns’ maid Anna. In all, an aptly incendiary show."

Now 62, and with half a dozen operas to his credit, Georg Friedrich Haas sets a libretto by the Norwegian writer Jon Fosse based on his own novel, published in 2000.Sung in German, but with some spoken sections in English, Morning and Evening largely avoids narrative (significantly no synopsis is printed in the programme). Instead, it offers something much more contemplative, focusing on the characters of the fisherman Olai and his son Johannes, whose lives are viewed through the significant moments of birth and death. As they consider their experiences, those to whom they are close, but who may also be either alive or dead, interact with them: Johannes’ wife Erna, his daughter Signe and his friend Peter.

                That said, the performers work hard to create a memorable experience. Graham Vick’s staging is discreet and focused, with Richard Hudson’s minimal, all-white sets turning slowly on a revolve. Distinguished Austrian actor Klaus Maria Brandauer plays the spoken role of Olai with dignity, but very little of his English text comes over. Christoph Pohl throws everything he has at Johannes, and both Helena Rasker as Erna and Sarah Wegener as Signe and the Midwife make an impression, while Will Hartmann suggests Peter’s warmth.The result – distanced, ruminative, philosophical – rarely grips, but the orchestra plays it with confidence under the baton of Michael Boder."

With much of the original cast in place, the characterisation of roles is strong and energetically performed across the board.The fairly monochromatic hue of the framing scenes, where Alice experiences the boredom of school holidays, contrasts with a brightly coloured Wonderland. The costumes and the set – the latter based on large picture postcards – are vividly eye-catching. The music features prominently throughout and is mostly, highly effective: Todd’s score relies heavily on pastiches of musicals, jazz and Latin American rhythms, but is skilfully put together, and the libretto is crisp and fresh (if occasionally possibly over the heads of littler ones – do they really know what ‘petits fours’ are?).There is not a weak link in the cast, in terms either of singing or acting. Director Martin Duncan has clearly worked hard with them to project an ideal balance of immediacy and picture-book fantasy. Even the smaller roles, such as Samantha Price’s and Daisy Brown’s Tweedledee and Tweedledum, show an impressive skill in physical comedy.Fflur Wyn is a wide-eyed Alice, but she has also the presence to draw the entire cast together. Keel Watson is a loafing, smoking caterpillar, who sings a cool blues; Fleur de Bray performs vocal acrobatics as the attention-seeking, prima-donna-ish ‘drink me’ Bottle. Maud Millar’s delightfully forgetful, jolly-hockey-sticks Duchess is an exceptional character portrait with very fine singing to match, and Robert Burt’s Queen of Hearts, while larger than life, is a cut above the typical pantomime dame."

With its complicated plot set partly in Spain and partly during a war in Italy, it is a piece that can easily fly apart. Bieito moves it from the 18th century to the 1930s of the Spanish Civil War, which at least gives it some consistency, though the visuals are undistinguished. Rebecca Ringst’s awkward sets alternate between fragmented street scenes –some of them distinctly inappropriate for their dramatic context – and the purely abstract.Characteristically, Bieito is dissatisfied with the level of violence already present in the piece, and adds a good deal more, again typically to the point where it loses impact. Preziosilla (decently sung by Rinat Shaham) may be a warmonger, but having her torture a pregnant woman during one of her numbers and execute an entire line of soldiers in another is taking things to the kind of extreme that gives Bieito’s work a bad name.He also has Tamara Wilson’s Leonora commit suicide at the end of the opera, rather than die at her brother’s hand. This destroys the sense of inexorable fate pursuing the characters that the opera is all about.Once again ENO’s high musical values to some extent rescue a misguided production. Wilson proves an extraordinary find – a soprano of sumptuous tone and power, who delivers the vocal goods. Gwyn Hughes Jones is on exciting form as her equally doomed lover, Alvaro. Anthony Michaels-Moore brings vigorous attack to revenge-obsessed brother Carlo, while Andrew Shore quite rightly concentrates on the sheer meanness of spirit of unchristian monk Melitone. James Creswell is the grandly sonorous Father Superior.Music director Mark Wigglesworth gives Verdi’s score the sweep and momentum it needs, and ENO’s orchestra and chorus are on their finest form."

The programme includes what is apparently the earliest surviving opera by a female composer: The Liberation of Ruggiero from Alcina’s Island, by Francesca Caccini, first performed in Florence in 1625.These days Francesca’s father Giulio is better known than she is, but in her day she was one of the most admired singers and composers of the time – and not only in Italy. Sadly, this is the only one of her 16 stage works to survive, presumably because it was the only one to be published. The story is a playful comic treatment of the story of the knight Ruggiero and the sorceress Alcina, taken from a once-famous epic poem by Ariosto: Handel’s much later and far more serious setting is reasonably well known.Caccini’s turns out to be a delightful piece, structured more like Monteverdi’s earlier Orfeo than his later operas, with choral movements interspersing the solo recitatives. Deborah Roberts, musical director of a staging in which a sizeable cast plus chorus and a choice period-instrument ensemble also make their mark, has made her own edition.Susannah Waters’ end-of-the-pier staging moves the action – appropriately enough – to Brighton beach in the early 20th century. With a painted fairground in the background and a full-scale bathing machine upfront, Ellan Parry’s designs are clever and colourful. The handheld surtitles are a hoot.While the entire cast enters fully into the spirit of both piece and staging, three central performers stand out. Soprano Anna Devin brings vocal and physical glamour to Alcina. Tenor Nick Pritchard clearly enjoys being the easily led Ruggiero. Countertenor Denis Lakey plays the androgynous Melissa – who saves Ruggiero from Alcina’s wicked spells – as a drag queen. Who would have thought that an early Baroque opera could be so much fun?"
311,"Turandot review at the Grand Opera House, Belfast – ‘bold, brash and brutal’",https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/turandot-review-at-the-grand-opera-house-belfast-bold-brash-and-brutal/,Turandot,the Grand Opera House,Belfast,3,2015-11-02,Edward Bhesania,"Iconoclastic director Calixto Bieito’s Carmen, recently revived by English National Opera, may be relatively tame by his usual provocative standards, but in his Turandot his approach is as hard-hitting as ever. The subjugated masses here are workers in a Chinese doll factory. The place is run by a psychotic Turandot, while her ministers Ping, Pang and Pong are depraved henchmen in army uniform.Calaf is brutally beaten up for standing out from the crowd of workers. Turandot’s father, the Emperor, hobbles around in a nappy. A video projection shows a man’s face gradually being daubed with Chinese script until, by the end, it is covered in black ink. Most disturbing of all is the element of domination through sexual control. At home, the ministers don wedding dresses carried by a semi-naked slave, and Turandot has two female bodies suspended by ropes as well as one on a leash. The factory workers are randomly stripped and debased by the ministers.Bieito’s Turandot is a commentary on the atrocities of tyrannical regimes and the loss of identity through conformity; so it’s unsurprising that he ends the opera with Liu’s death, the juncture that Puccini reached at his death: rather than being transformed by Calaf’s love, Turandot is here left unhinged by the uprooting of her power.Miriam Murphy’s harsh-sounding Turandot was unsettling in its own way, and though Neal Cooper sang gallantly as Calaf, his role was shorn of its dramatic weight. Anna Patalong as Liu created a rare lyrical and expressive high point in her Act II aria. If the Ulster Orchestra under David Brophy took a while to find its stride, the adult and children’s choirs were extremely impressive throughout."
312,"Orpheus review at Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, London – ‘a musical success’",https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/orpheus-review-at-sam-wanamaker-playhouse-london-a-musical-success/,Orpheus,Sam Wanamaker Playhouse,London,3,2015-10-29,George Hall,"Back in March 2014, the Royal Opera joined forces with Shakespeare’s Globe to present the first opera in the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse – Cavalli’s L’Ormindo of 1644, in a production by Kasper Holten that was widely viewed as a success and revived in February of this year.Now the collaboration is renewed with another 17th-century work: Luigi Rossi’s Orfeo, first performed in Paris in 1647. Historically, the piece is important as the first opera to be commissioned in France – though a couple of ready-made Italian examples (including another by Cavalli) had previously made it over the Alps.Rossi’s version of the Orpheus story – sung here, sensibly, in an English translation by Christopher Cowell – is a lengthy one, with lots of extra characters and a good deal more plot detail than either Monteverdi’s or Gluck’s much better known settings, as well as quite a few comic scenes.As with L’Ormindo, the piece and the venue make an excellent match. On the gallery above the stage, Baroque music specialist Christian Curnyn conducts nine members of the Orchestra of Early Opera Company, who give a finely balanced account of the score.With convincing singers throughout the cast, the music comes over persuasively: particularly delightful are the interventions of the three Graces, sung by Lauren Fagan, Jennifer Davis and Emily Edmonds, while from a purely visual point of view Nicky Shaw’s straightforward props and period costumes work well.Keith Warner’s staging is more problematic. The complex narrative registers as it needs to, but the tone is at times laborious, particularly in the comic scenes, which feel like hard work for everyone concerned. There are memorable individual contributions, nevertheless, from Siobhan Stagg’s Orpheus, Louise Alder’s Eurydice and especially Caitlin Hulcup’s Aristaeus in the principal roles. Supporting them, Sky Ingram as Venus and Keri Fuge as Cupid, as well as Philip Smith in the dual roles of Endymion and Charon, all perform well."
313,Saul review at Glyndebourne – ‘demands to be seen’,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/saul-review-at-glyndebourne-demands-to-be-seen/,Saul,Glyndebourne – ‘demands to be seen’,Saul review at Glyndebourne,4,2015-10-28,George Hall,"Directed by Australian-born, Berlin-based Barrie Kosky – currently one of the hottest properties in opera – Handel’s oratorio remains a virtuoso piece of theatre as revived for Glyndebourne’s autumn tour by Donna Stirrup.Even if there are individual elements where Kosky’s taste for excess becomes, well, just a tad excessive, one has to admire the consistently striking visuals of Katrin Lea Tag’s designs. Outstanding, too, are the vigour and imagination of the characterisations and interactions explored in what might seem – given that the work was not originally intended for the stage – an extraordinary piece of theatre developed from unlikely material.Sung with insight and on a grand scale, Henry Waddington’s Saul offers a crucial richness at the lower end of his bass-baritone range; as the Israelite king disintegrates before us, the performer rises to a Lear-like greatness.While acting the part of Saul’s young, ambitious and ultimately successful rival David with keen perception, South African countertenor Christopher Ainslie brings outstanding tonal beauty to his singing.Saul’s two soprano daughters find effective interpreters in Sarah Tynan’s haughty Merab and Anna Devin’s more sympathetic Michal. Benjamin Hulett makes an attractive and lyrical Jonathan, while fellow-tenor Stuart Jackson pulls off a remarkable feat in successfully combining four smaller roles.The downside of Kosky’s no-holds-barred theatrical approach lies in a tendency for the characters to shout rather than to sing the notes – in which case, why not just jettison Handel altogether and simply turn Saul into a play? There’s also a little too much revelling in camp – brilliantly done though (for instance) the West-End-musicals-style dancing sequences are, a little goes quite a long way.While this is a production that demands to be seen, it most certainly deserves to be heard as well, especially with the Glyndebourne Chorus and Glyndebourne on Tour Orchestra on such resplendent form under the baton of Baroque specialist Laurence Cummings."
314,"The Lighthouse review at Royal Opera House, London – ‘shows signs of distinction’",https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/the-lighthouse-review-at-royal-opera-house-london-shows-signs-of-distinction/,The Lighthouse,Royal Opera House,London,3,2015-10-23,Edward Bhesania,"Despite the recent news that he is undergoing a second course of chemotherapy following the re-emergence of his leukaemia, Peter Maxwell Davies, former master of the Queen’s music, gallantly joined the cast and creatives – almost all drawn from the Royal Opera House’s Jette Parker Young Artists scheme – for applause at the first night of this short run.Davies’ The Lighthouse is an unsettling, claustrophobic and supernatural piece based on the unexplained disappearance of three keepers from an Outer Hebrides lighthouse in 1900. In part one, the three cast members play the three supply-ship officers who arrive at the abandoned lighthouse, the action intercutting between their individual examinations in an Edinburgh courtroom and their arrival at the remote lighthouse; part two goes back further still, following the keepers themselves: their boredom, bickering and ghostly hallucinations.Alyson Cummins’ bare set, misty and darkly lit, is effective but could do even more to heighten the sense of claustrophobia. David Shipley, as bible-bashing Arthur, has a capacious bass and an eloquent expression of outward stoicism. Samuel Sakker (Sandy) is winningly lyrical in his upper range and moves seamlessly into falsetto; he comes into his own in his mildly erotic music-hall aria, accompanied by cello and pub-style piano. Yuriy Yurchuk (Blazes) left us in no doubt that he is the roughest of the three keepers.However, the singers couldn’t always compete with the ensemble in the pit, leading to some masking of the words. If the drama acquires more dark intensity and the playing beds down some more, this will be a very powerful production."
315,Carmen at the Royal Opera House review – ‘lively revival’,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/carmen-at-the-royal-opera-house-review-lively-revival/,Carmen at the Royal Opera House review – ‘lively revival’,,Carmen at the Royal Opera House review,3,2015-10-20,Graham Rogers,"Carmen was a failure at its 1875 Paris premiere, the Opera Comique audiences not ready for its potent sex and violence. Bizet would be astonished that his final opera swiftly became the most popular of all time, withstanding treatments from flamenco to Bollywood. Francesca Zambello’s 2006 Royal Opera production is reassuringly traditional though, retaining a mid-19th century Seville setting with Tanya McCallin’s colourful lived-in costumes and spacious sets, and Paule Constable’s sun-drenched lighting. Although by no means an essential ingredient, there is plenty of spectacle too in this slick revival by Duncan Macfarland – live animals, abseiling gypsies, lively choreography (Arthur Pita/Sirena Tocco), action-packed fights (Mike Loades/Natalie Dakin), and bustling street scenes with a brilliantly animated children’s chorus.Enthralling and joyous as all this is, it does pull focus from the domestic relationships at the heart of the story and the two leads in this fifth revival can’t quite compensate. Russian mezzo Elena Maximova cuts an ideally gypsy-like figure in the title role, sultry and agile, her voice robust and rounded – though lacking the tingle factor of Australian soprano Nicole Car’s winsome Micaela. Alexander Vinogradov brings Russian depth to toreador Escamillo and American tenor Bryan Hymel can’t be faulted for strength and sweetness, but he is an unimpassioned Jose – the final showdown between the lovers has little tension. Surely superstar Jonas Kaufmann will bring more danger when he takes over mid-run.Emphasising the opera’s Comique origins, conductor Betrand de Billy maintains a fresh, taut pace. His briskness occasionally threatens clarity and stability, but it’s a generally effective and radiant account of this marvellously tune-packed score."
316,La Boheme at London Coliseum review – ‘strong performances’,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/la-boheme-at-london-coliseum-review-strong-performances/,La Boheme at London Coliseum review – ‘strong performances’,,La Boheme at London Coliseum review,4,2015-10-19,George Hall,"Introduced back in 2009, Jonathan Miller’s staging of Puccini’s tragic romance enjoyed success without turning into one of his endlessly revivable hits. Given La Boheme’s immense popularity, ENO has decided to replace it with this co-production with the Dutch National Opera, first seen in Amsterdam in 2014. Australian director Benedict Andrews, who has already supplied the company with an acclaimed Return of Ulysses (2011) and an admired staging of Detlev Glanert’s Caligula (2012), returns to supervise it.The programme includes an informal photograph of Andy Warhol’s The Factory from 1965, and though it’s not quite clear where we are in the visuals provided by Johannes Schutz’s sets and Victoria Behr’s costumes, the period feels right. Amanda Holden’s excellent translation refers to the French daily newspaper Le Figaro and euros, so perhaps Puccini’s Paris is now more recent than that.The setting among young, struggling artists is, after all, pretty universal, and nothing about this staging jars – not even the shooting up indulged in by Zach Borichevsky’s Rodolfo and Corinne Winters’ Mimi as they get it together in the first act.The least successful scene is the second act, where the revolving sets are confusing without really adding up to a recognisable café; but generally, this is a La Boheme for our times, and works extremely well on that level.There are strong elements, too, among the young and good-looking central cast, with Duncan Rock’s sturdy Marcello seizing attention from the start and Winters developing increasing vocal charisma as the show continues.As Rodolfo, tenor Borichevsky has some tricky moments around the top of his voice, though gives a good account of himself dramatically. Rhian Lois offers a Musetta rich in personality and lyricism, and the secondary roles are all expertly performed.Chinese conductor Xian Zhang makes a welcome return to the pit, bringing considerable style and perfect cohesion to the musical performance."
317,"Ulla’s Odyssey review at Kings Place, London – ‘clear, involving storytelling’",https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/ullas-odyssey-review-at-kings-place-london-clear-involving-storytelling/,Ulla’s Odyssey,Kings Place,London,3,2015-10-19,Edward Bhesania,"After nearly five years based at Islington’s King’s Head Theatre, OperaUpClose is venturing into new arenas. Kings Place is host to Ulla’s Odyssey, by New Zealand composer Anthony Young and Canadian librettist Leanna Brodie, winner of OperaUpClose’s 2014 Flourish chamber opera competition. Aimed at young audiences (aged seven plus), it is inspired both by Homer’s Odyssey and the experiences of real-life, teenage round-the-world sailors.Ulla is attempting her own solo voyage in The Homer. Sarah Minns plays the teenager with a degree of wide-eyed wonder, but also underlines a keen streak of determination. Ulla returns in triumph, if not in the unalloyed fashion she envisaged, and with – poignantly – the willingness to learn lessons about herself. Like Odysseus, she braves storms and encounters sea monsters along the way.Poseidon becomes an imperious sea-goddess; Cyclops is cast as Cy-Ops, an unyielding robotic security system; and the sea monsters are Sylla and Garibdis – the former almost succeeds in acquiring Ulla’s puppet cat Binnacle for supper, while the latter, formed of trash discarded by humans, gently introduces a note of environmental consideration. Aside from their roles, the cast members deftly bring props into play and animate Binnacle, as well as playing out the voices of Ulla’s parents.The neat direction leads to clear, involving storytelling, and the cast engages enthusiastically with the younger audience members, who can sit close up to the action if they choose. Part of the strength of Ulla’s Odyssey is the judicious balance of music and speech, so that the former contributes a genuinely dramatic dimension. A children’s opera approached with grown-up values."

Each has their own compartment and each appears visually awkward in each other’s spaces. Always in black, the scheming Malatesta moves freely between all of them, not least in the overture, during which he slinks between them as the stage rotates. Dressed from head-to-toe in brilliant white, the chorus is a crowd of theatregoers observing and commenting on the spectacle. The action is set in the early 18th century, more than 100 years before it was written.Some of this layering may mute the comic edge, but it succeeds in adding insight into the characters’ relationships and motivations. At times it goes too far – the occasional black interstitial revolve featuring Malatesta as a subsumer of the spaces adds little; and there is a curious bolt-on to the scenario, such that – even though he is helping to bring Ernesto and Norina together – Malatesta has some sort of future with Norina.In the well-matched cast, Jose Fardilha is the comic core as the old buffoon Pasquale whose scheme to disinherit Ernesto spectacularly collapses; Finnish tenor Tuomas Katajala sings Ernesto with a ringing tone tempered by a creamy lyricism; and Eliana Pretorian is a seamlessly duplicitous Norina. Significantly, the orchestral playing gains a wonderful lift and loving detail under Duncan Ward, making a striking Glyndebourne debut."

It’s certainly a responsible edition.Bonas’ overall vision – the writer Hoffmann transforms into a maker of silent movies at the period when the talkies are coming in – is rendered with genuine panache in Oliver Townsend’s designs, aided by some brilliant video interventions by Zakk Hein and memorably atmospheric lighting by Mark Howland.Film aficionados will enjoy spotting particular references, but as much as individual imagery – the doll Olympia in the first of Hoffmann’s disastrous love stories is as cleverly done as you will ever see it – it’s the narrative sweep of the whole that makes the evening the weird but fascinating blend of the comic, the romantic and the sinister that its original creators intended. Jeff Clarke’s English version is perfectly crafted too, effortlessly capturing the opera’s complex spirit.Vocal values are consistently high, with four principals in particular taking on huge assignments with conviction and style. Rising star tenor Sam Furness brings burnished and varied tone to his self-destructive Hoffmann. Soprano Ilona Domnich shines as his four strikingly contrasted lovers. Dressed as a schoolboy with cap and shorts, Louise Mott brings sterling voice and dramatic integrity to Hoffmann’s loyal pal, Nicklausse, tripling up as his Muse and the voice of frail Antonia’s ghostly mother, while with his grandiose acting and incisive baritone Warwick Fyfe creates an indelible impression as the four villains."
321,ETO’s Werther at the Britten Theatre review – ‘some fine singing’,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/etos-werther-at-the-britten-theatre-review-some-fine-singing/,ETO’s Werther at the Britten Theatre review – ‘some fine singing’,,ETO’s Werther at the Britten Theatre review,2,2015-10-09,Edward Bhesania,"The second of the trio of French operas that forms ETO’s autumn tour is Massenet’s popular tragedy based on Goethe’s novel The Sorrows of Young Werther. The action is shifted from the late-1700s Germany to 1940s America, Oliver Townsend’s design offering a surprisingly humble domestic setting for the Bailli’s dwelling, with a tiny kitchen to one side.The single set doesn’t itself cause too many problems, nor does the reduction of the orchestra to just piano, violin, clarinet and cello (in a skilful arrangement by Iain Farrington, who directs from the piano). It’s of relatively little disturbance too that director Oliver Platt has excised some of the minor roles. The decision to opt for Massenet’s own version casting the hero Werther as a baritone rather than a tenor is where things start to fall apart. This is not because the baritone voice is inherently less thrilling than a tenor’s but that, in this particular treatment, Werther, sung by Ed Ballard, comes over as a gawky bespectacled whiner, rather than an impassioned would-be lover for whom Charlotte’s decision to honour her promise to marry Albert (here a cigarette-smoking GI and so easily more attractive) can lead only to suicide. Rather than crackling with tension, Werther’s Act 3 scene with Charlotte, when she momentarily succumbs to him, is faintly cringe-inducing. Charlotte herself (Carolyn Dobbin) also needs more dramatic definition, but is warmly and gushingly sung while Simon Wallfisch is a forthright Albert. Lauren Zolezzi steals the show as the radiant, ever-cheery Sophie, whose sunny outlook shines through her voice too."

The first is a reduced version of Debussy’s only completed opera, based on Maurice Maeterlinck’s symbolist play.The reduction is the work of the Belgian composer Annalies Van Parys, scored for 13 players. Jonathan Berman conducts with a palpable sense of momentum without being entirely successful in solving those problems of balance that the new scoring throws up, yet the distinctive musical character of the piece registers strongly.There are cuts. The secondary characters and the chorus disappear, while the interval comes in an odd place. Director James Conway also decides to reinstate in spoken form a sung section dropped by Van Parys. All of these choices are debatable, though the overall trajectory of this intimate and mysterious tragedy remains intact.Conway directs with expertise: even with its multiple ambiguities, the narrative maintains focus and the characterisations conviction. Oliver Townsend’s unit set – not much more than a box and a few spotlights, plus a second, recessed inner space and some atmospheric wallpaper – supplies a spare but effective frame.Vocal and acting values are uniformly high, even if soprano Lauren Zolezzi is not really a natural exponent of the male child Yniold. Often effectively sung by a tenor to offer greater contrast with his very different baritone half-brother Golaud, the role of Pelleas is delivered with subtlety in Jonathan McGovern’s light baritone, while Golaud is represented by the darker bass-baritone tones of Stephan Loges, who suggests with unerring skill a man disintegrating through steadily increasing frustration and insecurity.The flawless surface of Susanna Hurrell’s fresh soprano helps her outline a near-ideal Melisande. Michael Druiett is a consistently imposing Arkel, while Helen Johnson maximises the impact of Genevieve’s famous letter-reading scene."

Naturally, the great man of the theatre was well received; but his venerable show itself is starting to look whiskery.Its basis remains sound enough. Tanya McCallin’s traditional designs are still handsome. Narrative values and blocking are impeccable. But on this occasion there is not much sense of an ensemble, while some of the individual performances are distinctly ordinary.Experienced baritone Andrew Shore, continues to put in a lively turn as Bartolo, though these days his comic routines need a bit of editing.Mezzo Kathryn Rudge sings a strong Rosina, but one curiously lacking in personal magnetism; it is not that easy to care about her marital fate. Similarly, baritone Morgan Pearse sings a perfectly decent Figaro, but he is short on Latin vivacity, never suggesting the wily servant several steps ahead of his master. This creates a dramatic gap at the centre of the show, which should be a whirl of activity: barber Figaro, after all, is the opera’s title role.Mexican tenor Eleazar Rodriguez takes a while to gather himself as Almaviva, and his is not really a special voice, but he enters upon the comic disguises with enthusiasm and by the end of the evening he has stepped up to the mark. Bass Barnaby Rea makes a larger-than-life Basilio and soprano Katherine Broderick is a memorable Berta.The orchestra and chorus do their job expertly and American conductor Christopher Allen conducts dutifully. Yet the overall result feels tepid and even a bit tired. Perhaps the time has come for the company to take a new look at this popular classic."

But the evening belongs to incoming music director Mark Wigglesworth, who conducts a grandly expansive account of a work he previously conducted for the company in the David Pountney production in 2001, and to wide-ranging American soprano Patricia Racette, who brings authority and intensity to the title role.Set in mid-19th-century Russia, Shostakovich’s 1934 opera shows the oppression of individuals – especially women – by the male-dominated merchant classes and the authorities as a whole. Characteristically, Tcherniakov updates the setting to a modern factory, in which bored boss’s wife Katerina herself seems to inhabit a space where rich oriental carpets and her old-fashioned dress suggest that she is a deliberate remnant of the original setting.The production contains some unfortunate elements. Bizarrely, the brutal sexual attack on Rosie Aldridge’s Aksinya by her fellow-workers is something she almost seems to encourage. And the final act, supposed to take place amongst a travelling group of deported prisoners in an open-air setting, is confined to a tiny prison cell, where Katerina’s murder of her rival and her own subsequent suicide – here she is kicked to death by guards instead – are far less effective than the libretto’s version. The chorus, meanwhile, is invisible and offstage.Thanks to Wigglesworth’s empowered conducting, a superb performance from ENO’s orchestra, and Racette’s consistent strength, the opera hits hard. Supporting performances by John Daszak as Katerina’s worthless lover Sergei, Peter Hoare as her loathsome husband Zinovy Ismailov, and Robert Hayward as her vile father-in-law Boris, are also well within the frame."

During the evening we walked (sometimes turning a whirring sound hose), ate (a vegan chick-pea dish) and washed up. In between came interludes of music, whether based on the primordial harmonic series, birdsong (while we slowly raised and lowered our arms by our sides), or more abstract expression. The musicians, intermingling with the audience, took on a shamanistic guise.There was a John Cage-like sense in which the focus on all environmental sounds became musical – to which end the improvised clinking by musicians of cutlery against bowls as we ate appeared like subliminal music. But the most remarkable effect was our return to the speaking world, initiated after waves of a mantra-like hummed motif, which led first to the minutest stirrings of hand percussion instruments and then to a joyous, playful percussive awakening that spread across the audience.This was a sincere and immersive experience, but ultimately there was too little drama or ritual for it to feel like opera or musical theatre."

And yet it’s hard to pinpoint why.It could be the deft upstairs/downstairs distinction drawn between the Count and his valet Figaro – highlighted partly by the contrast of the resplendent spacious interiors of the Count’s 1830s chateau against Figaro’s dark, cramped quarters; and partly by the presence of a small platoon of household staff going about their business.It could be the decision not to play up the pantomime and chaos elements so that the focus rests with the base emotions – lust, rejection, revenge – that generate the complex and dizzying web of scheming and outwitting. And there is any number of loving touches: the way the grand hall of Act 3 melts into the twilit Act 4 garden scene; or the moment we see the Countess yielding to the adolescent Cherubino’s advances.If Anita Hartig’s Susanna is just a touch underformed in character, the singing throughout is at a high level. Stephane Degout is assured as the Count and Ellie Dehn makes a distinguished Royal Opera debut as the Countess. Kate Lindsey’s Cherubino is expertly observed and even the smaller roles cut through, notably Heather Engerbretson’s wide-eyed Barbarina and Carlo Lepore’s colourful Bartolo. But Erwin Schrott is perhaps the highlight, singing with sophistication and playing a chillaxed Figaro for whom everything is apparently under control. In the pit, Ivor Bolton brings fresh, period-informed playing that underlines the pace of the action."

From a musical point of view, the result maintains an extremely high standard.And for once, the show is equally dramatically exciting. Unusually, it is jointly credited to two directors: Israeli-born, UK-resident choreographer Hofesh Shechter, who brings 22 members of his company to provide the crucial dance element in the piece, and the Royal Opera’s associate director, John Fulljames. Shechter’s striking choreography undeniably adds to the conviction of what is already a memorable staging.Conor Murphy’s designs place the Monteverdi Orchestra on a platform at the back of the stage that moves up and down to reposition them at various levels. Semi-abstract in feel, the physical result is both visually and emotionally powerful, and all in all a spirited realisation of Gluck’s opera that launches the season in high style."

One might take greater exception to the close where, instead of being granted an amnesty and the hand of his beloved, in a cynical directorial gesture Arturo is executed by the Protestants/Puritans. Tenor Barry Banks consequently loses his written vocal lines at the close: instead one gains a harsh view of Northern Ireland’s Protestant community.For all that, Miskimmon’s stagecraft, however wilfully employed, is expert, and the show looks good in Leslie Travers’ designs.Vocally, this is a rewarding evening. As well as Feola’s exceptional Elvira, Barry Banks’ high-lying tenor and focused technique bring him considerable success as Arturo, while David Kempster is striking as his rival, Riccardo, and Polish bass Wojtek Gierlach presents a sterling account of Elvira’s uncle, Giorgio Valton.Best of all is the sensitive conducting of Carlo Rizzi, who draws exceptional music-making from the WNO Orchestra and Chorus."

But on this showing they are offering a valuable contribution to touring opera in this country.The staging is unfussy, even traditional, and the choreography necessarily contained to suit smaller stages, but the storytelling is sturdy. The singing is sometimes very good, and the orchestral playing of a high standard.On the first night, tenor Ivan Snigirev produced an often thrilling head-tone as Alfredo, but there’s a tightness in the voice too, and he struggled with tuning in Parigi, o cara, his Act 3 duet with Violetta. His father Giorgio, sung by Andrei Kovalev, is anodyne and ill-defined, and some of the smaller roles hardly cut through.But then there’s Violetta – Olga Georgieva on first night – captivating as the demi-mondaine who, though a hedonist at heart, sacrifices her lifestyle and possessions to be with Alfredo. She brings a wide range of vocal colouring and sings tirelessly. On the stage she is the dramatic glue that sets the performance.There’s a firm anchor in the pit, too, with fine orchestral playing from the 30-piece orchestra, and well judged conducting from the young Azat Maksutov, who moves seamlessly between the fleet-footed dance music on the one hand, and moments of unexaggerated dramatic intensity on the other."

The singers are largely static – at least in placement – appearing from revolving doors high up the screen or at stage level.Being static helps create strong and vibrant vocal performances. Olga Pudova, with only her face visible as a screen-filling arachnid Queen of the Night, nails the coloratura. A bobbed Maureen McKay is little-girl-lost Pamina. Trapped amidst darkly grotesque 1920s-style depictions of terror, she is suitably clear, pure and resonant of tone. Allan Clayton’s Tamino is sturdy and upright, as he should be.Dominik Koninger’s Papageno is the standout performance, however. Drawing on Buster Keaton for inspiration, and followed everywhere by a spiky black cat, his interaction with the surrounding graphics is faultless and, while hilarious, also enlightening.Paul Barritt’s animations allow the production to travel into uncharted territory – Pamina is swallowed by the dragon, for example. But it also allows directors Suzanne Andrade and Barrie Kosky to comment on the dialogue and add greater textures of meaning – at least to the character interaction. An intriguing, often humorous, production which opens up the work to new audiences and demands repeated viewing – without having anything particularly profound to say."

In The Medium, she is an unnamed clairvoyant, who performs straightforward palm readings before becoming possessed by a gamut of characters: a ‘good angel’ to whom she yields sexually, a haughty mistress with the shadow of a lost child, the child itself (a creepy changeling), a rabid bloodhound, and so on. By the end, our ‘medium’ is undergoing electroconvulsive therapy and we realise we have falsely rationalised her madness.For The Wanton Sublime, Hai-Ting Chinn swaps her light, high-necked Victorian dress for a sharp city suit. Setting a libretto by American poet Anna Rabinowitz, O’Regan – whose Heart of Darkness played at the Linbury Studio Theatre in 2011 – uses a nine-piece band (including electric guitar and drums) to underpin the journey of a Virgin Mary figure, stripped of her iconic symbolism and grappling in today’s world with her unasked-for role.Her journey begins with incredulity and disdain before finally reaching acceptance, by which point both music and text have attained a more sublime tone. The Wanton Sublime is better suited to a broader performance space, while the Arcola’s intimate Studio 2 is perfect in conveying the claustrophobia and immediacy of The Medium."

Her husband is oddly threatened by this hint of new life, finally admitting that as a government official he knows how really bad things are and can’t allow himself to succumb to any false hope.This ‘short opera’ is actually more than half spoken, and neither Zinnie Harris’s libretto nor John Harris’s music takes the expected route of rising from speech to song at moments of heightened passion. The first sung line, a few minutes in, is “There’s a bump in the lino”, and although that bump will turn out to be significant, the line itself is casual, as are many of the sung moments, sometimes no longer than a word or phrase later on.Partly because of that, the music seems imposed on the drama rather than being an integral part of it, and one can imagine the short play being no less effective without it.Accompanied by the composer at a keyboard, generally playing extended chords or counter melodies under the sung melodies, Alan McHugh and Pauline Knowles capture the small personal drama most effectively in the spoken passages."
334,Carmen,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/carmen-3/,Carmen,,Carmen,4,2015-08-13,Graham Rogers,"Shoestring company OperaUpClose is renowned for stripping opera back to its bare essentials, but its previous Carmen production three years ago came under fire for reducing Bizet’s perennially popular grand opera to 80 minutes, little more than a highlights package. Lessons have been learned. This rethink gives Carmen a less radical pared-down treatment that retains the integrity of the fiery story, plausibly transposing the setting from 19th-century Seville to a South American Nowheresville dustbowl but changing little else. The tune-packed score is all but intact too and, thanks to Harry Blake’s skilful reduction and the superb quartet of musicians, led from the piano by Berrak Dyer, who play it, Bizet’s orchestra is, amazingly, barely missed.Director Robin Norton-Hale’s plain-spoken translation and the cast’s excellent diction (particularly impressive in the sparkling rapid-fire quintet) ensure compelling dramatic impact. Reasonably, Norton-Hale invites us to see the tragic heroine as a victim of domestic abuse rather than an inevitably but romantically doomed gypsy flirt, so the production has a darker tone than some. Flora McIntosh’s Carmen is not overtly sexy, but she conveys a capricious and strong-willed woman who is also vulnerable. Her final, chilling confrontation with Anthony Flaum’s increasingly skin-crawling Jose, her dangerously besotted former lover, feels all too grimly real.If a full orchestra, chorus and elaborate set are your prime concerns, this is not for you. But with a strong-voiced, tight-knit cast that fully commits to the drama in the intimate Soho Theatre space (a merciful liberation from the stifling backroom of The Kings Head, Islington), this Carmen makes a powerfully direct impact no opera house can match."

This new staging of Rossini’s final and most ambitious opera by the Italian director Damiano Michieletto highlights an alarming trend that registers here in a worryingly extreme form.Guillaume Tell (William Tell in English) tells the story of the legendary medieval Swiss patriot who challenges and defeats the Austrian occupying forces. In the opera’s most famous scene, Tell is forced to shoot his arrow at an apple placed on his son Jemmy’s head – and succeeds in slicing it in two while leaving the boy unharmed.Michieletto and his design team replace traditional imagery with grungy modern dress, creating some of the ugliest and most unattractively lit stage pictures ever presented by the Royal Opera. Despite the time-switch, a medieval figure – inevitably silent, but clearly intended to represent the traditional Tell – constantly bestrides the stage, urging the action on.One feeble idea succeeds another. The standard of acting from the principals is poor. Many additional bits of business are either irrelevant, or obscure, or both, with the ballet movements in particular filled with pointless and extraneous activity.One scene, in which the Swiss women are supposed to be made to dance by the Austrian soldiery, is ramped up into a gratuitous gang-rape that provokes the noisiest and most sustained booing I can ever recall during any performance at this address.Intellectually poverty-stricken, emotionally crass and with indifferent stagecraft, the result is nowhere near the standard an international company should be aiming at.There are vocal and musical compensations – in Gerald Finley’s stern Tell, in the occasional passion of Malin Bystrom’s Mathilde, and in the high notes of John Osborn’s Arnold. Pappano, as usual, conducts with enthusiasm, and achieves solid results.But it’s simply not enough to salvage a dire evening."
346,Aida,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/aida/,Aida,,Aida,2,2015-06-25,George Hall,"Turn on the television news any night, and footage of conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa supplies regular and inescapable horror stories. Verdi’s 1871 opera concerns an ancient, fictional war between Egypt and Ethiopia, which the former easily wins: it explores themes of victory and defeat, patriotism and love, and the powerlessness of those nominally in charge of the state.Daniel Slater’s production sidesteps all these issues and sets the opera instead in a contemporary museum, where Verdi’s Egyptians become wealthy, hedonistic patrons – the famous triumph scene is a fancy-dress party that descends into an orgy – and Aida a lowly cleaner, with her father and the rest of the conquered Ethiopian army poor people oppressed by their betters.There’s an idea here, but it’s not Verdi’s, and anyone expecting the composer’s dramatic concerns to be seriously explored will be both puzzled and frustrated. The result is a trivialisation of the themes so boldly taken on in the original.It’s a pity, because Opera Holland Park has assembled an excellent cast for the piece, while both chorus and orchestra are on strong form under conductor Manlio Benzi, who really understands how this music should go.Gweneth-Ann Jeffers is a vocally commanding Aida, rising with confidence to the huge challenges of the title role. Heather Shipp hits the musical and dramatic heights as her rival, the Egyptian princess Amneris. Peter Auty is on top form as the Egyptian general Radames, singing with a genuinely heroic ring to his tone. Jonathan Veira is magnificent as Aida’s royal father Amonasro, his expressive use of the Italian text a model. Smaller roles such as Keel Watson’s King of Egypt and Graeme Broadbent’s High Priest Ramfis are both towers of strength.If only the show looked half as good as it sounded, but sadly it’s a case of shut your eyes and think of Egypt."

350,Tristan Und Isolde,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/tristan-und-isolde/,Tristan Und Isolde,,Tristan Und Isolde,4,2015-06-17,George Hall,"Longborough Festival Opera began operations in 1991 and has been performing Wagner most years since 1999, offering a full-scale Ring cycle in 2013 – and operatic challenges don’t come any bigger than that.This year, it’s the turn of another hugely challenging work in the shape of Wagner’s profound and overwhelming tale of love and death.When planning to perform Tristan, the first artists you need to locate are a soprano and a tenor who can convincingly represent the protagonists – their roles being as demanding as any in the operatic repertoire. Longborough scores convincingly here, with Peter Wedd and Rachel Nicholls offering interpretations that are dramatically focused and vocally determined.Wedd – who made a huge success of Lohengrin with Welsh National Opera two years ago – matches his earlier triumph with the even more demanding role of Wagner’s tragic knight; his sterling metal tone is always incisive, and he maintains his vocal impact right through to the end of the third-act mad scene.Perhaps a little less even, Nicholls still comes up with the goods required for Isolde, her clean and emotionally empowered vocalism fulfilling all essential requirements.Alongside such heroic performances, those by Stuart Pendred (a noble Kurwenal), Frode Olsen (a moving King Marke), and Ben Thapa (a notable Melot) are all perfectly aligned with the leads in terms of quality; Catherine Carby’s Brangane is nearly at this level – although she had a bad patch towards the end of Act I the night I attended.In other respects, the musical performance under conductor Anthony Negus is exceptional, the orchestral playing in particular sounding consistently rich and energised.Unfortunately, Carmen Jakobi’s insipid production, which includes two entirely unnecessary dancers doubling Tristan and Isolde, diminishes the overall quality of an evening that is otherwise of genuinely international quality."

352,Don Giovanni,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/don-giovanni/,Don Giovanni,,Don Giovanni,2,2015-06-14,Edward Bhesania,"No sooner than the curtain rises on Kasper Holten’s production of Don Giovanni, new last year and now revived by Amy Lane, the names of the lothario’s numerous conquests begin to emerge in scratchy script, projected onto the wood-panelled interior of the Commendatore’s house. Two magical features soon present themselves – the precision with which an array of text, ink-blots and other animated designs can be projected onto the set; and that the set is actually the front face of a giant revolving cube, revealing a 3D labyrinth of rooms and staircases. The ingenuity and execution are remarkable, but both features are quickly used to the point of frustration. Along with the ghostly women and the spirit of the murdered Commendatore that appear from time to time, these may all be Giovanni’s inward, guilt-tinged preoccupations, but they trounce the onstage drama.Often split across levels or rooms – is everyone else trapped too? – and continually conveyed like game show prizes or sushi by the mighty cube, the cast do their level best, and it’s no wonder there were moments of shaky ensemble with the orchestra on first night. Christopher Maltman’s luscious baritone is the aural reflection of his Giovanni, suavely understated but radiating sexual magnetism. His demise, though, in this truncated ending devised by Mozart for Vienna, has no time to make its mark. His long-suffering sidekick Leporello is brilliantly sung by Alex Esposito, and played with genuine comic spark. Rolando Villazon is the big-name Don Ottavio, not always sounding secure on first night, but with a technique that masks almost any imperfection. Albina Shagimuratova’s bright-toned Donna Anna and Dorothea Roschmann’ s ever-rejected Donna Elvira are wonderful performances. Alain Altinoglu makes a fearless debut in the pit. Take away the gimmickry, intensify the character direction and this could be a more satisfying production, but as it stands it’s difficult to believe the greatest seduction here hasn’t been performed by a come-hither box of tricks."

The cast is large (even with smaller parts doubled) and the intended locales – a Parisian quayside, a 17th-century convent and a medieval bedroom – might have been chosen to underline the limitations of OHP’s performance space.The absence of a pit can be a problem too. Stuart Stratford conducts the City of London Sinfonia with expansive sensitivity yet his singers are not always audible in Il Tabarro, even without the noises off typical of this semi-outdoor venue. A giant barge straddles the stage and ‏Stephen Gadd is a powerful Michele but with the action taking place in broad daylight, the team has not found a way to create a convincingly oppressive atmosphere.Dusk falls and the remaining operas play out more effectively against the same set of bare grey arches and walls, variously accessorised. Suor Angelica is notable for the searing psychological plausibility of its central confrontation between the wary Aunt of crimson-clad veteran Rosalind Plowright and the drab, diminutive, increasingly hysterical heroine (Anne Sophie Duprels). The senior nuns may be the real villains: director Oliver Platts sets the action in the convent laundry.The 1940s makeover of Gianni Schicchi is not new, having been seen first in 2012. Anna Patalong reprises her sweet-toned Lauretta with Richard Burkhard now dominating the stage in the title role. This is a self-consciously riotous production, its sometimes extraneous comic business tautly directed. While the mimed prelude is certainly too long, the closing ‘balcony scene’ provides respite and a modest coup de theatre."

Unlike the great Da Ponte triptych, The Magic Flute was conceived as popular entertainment, not high art. Mozart’s final opera contains some of his most sublime music, but is also laden with hummable, folksy tunes, and – thanks to earthy bird-catcher Papegeno – bawdy comedy. McVicar’s is a more lofty take, however, downplaying the humour, and – with John Macfarlane’s gloomy marble halls – favouring the work’s questionable Masonic philosophy over its dream-world fantasy. The libretto’s unpalatable racism is adjusted – Monastotos is an ogre rather than a Moor – but McVicar doesn’t confront its sexism. Sorastro’s “Enlightened” message to women is: you’re useless without a man."

What is new – at least to the London Coliseum – is Richard Jones’ production of the longest work in the standard repertoire, one of the greatest challenges any opera company can take on. That ENO mounts such a tremendous show in difficult circumstances confirms the underlying health and ambition of the company under artistic director John Berry.Fielded during this epic evening are 89 orchestral musicians, a chorus of 90 and 17 principals; those who are calling for the company to abandon the Coliseum might care to ponder how many London venues could even contemplate housing this scale of operatic enterprise.Jones’ Mastersingers started life in Cardiff in 2010, where Bryn Terfel starred as cobbler-poet Hans Sachs. It was a big success in Wales, and it was surely an inspired idea to allow London audiences to see it, too. Shared productions in straitened times is one way forward – provided the stagings are strong enough.This vision of the piece surely is. Indeed, it is thoughtful and persuasive throughout. Representing the German masters in the widest sense are the composers, writers, scientists, philosophers and other creatives depicted on the production’s front cloth, cleverly defusing a connection with extreme nationalism that has unfortunately tainted the work’s reputation in recent decades. But Jones’ direction is consistently detailed and perceptive – only the riot at the end of Act II seems a little staid and static. Paul Steinberg’s sets offer a spare but apt depiction of 16th-century Nuremberg, and Buki Shiff’s magnificent costumes match them perfectly.Bass-baritone Iain Paterson presents his first Hans Sachs, showing a confident command of the immensely daunting role, which he approaches with a keen sensitivity to words he shares with all his colleagues. Indeed, the company’s commitment to English-language performance is amply vindicated by this evening alone.That great comic actor Andrew Shore makes his stage debut as Beckmesser, never once going too far in his brilliantly drawn, sometimes surprisingly touching, characterisation; he ends up naked at the end of Act II, his modesty preserved by a tightly clutched lute.Mostly associated with Italian and French roles, Welsh tenor Gwyn Hughes Jones here moves into the German repertory, which suits him well: he is vocally unstinting and tireless as the knight Walther von Stolzing. Rachel Nicholls is secure if a little bland as Eva, while American bass James Creswell is vocally magnificent as Pogner.Marshalling the evening’s grand musical resources is ENO’s music director Edward Gardner, whose immaculate sense of balance and flow denotes a great Wagner conductor.Verdict: At a time of considerable uncertainty for the company, English National Opera stages a world-class Wagner productionGeorge Hall"
381,Der Fliegende Hollander,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/der-fliegende-hollander-8/,Der Fliegende Hollander,,Der Fliegende Hollander,,2015-02-06,The Stage,"Tim Albery’s 2009 staging of Wagner’s The Flying Dutchman returns for its second revival. The opera is played in the continuous version Wagner conceived but never actually performed, with the three acts linked into one. Wagner fans may also want to know that the original versions of the ending of the overture and the opera as a whole are played, rather than the better known revisions.In any case this modern-dress staging conveys well the dour, windswept quality of the piece itself, and revival director Daniel Dooner achieves acting performances of real quality from all the principals, even if German-Canadian tenor Michael Konig proves to be a stolid rather than an imaginative Erik; on the other hand, he sings the role with force and impact.No complaints about the other principals. You will never hear a better Dutchman than Bryn Terfel, and few will act the role as well: he carries the undead character’s centuries of suffering on his back. Equally impressive is Canadian soprano Adrianne Pieczonka’s Senta. She sings this tiring, awkwardly written role impeccably, and the character’s obsession with the legendary seafarer who suddenly turns up to marry her is palpably real; this is perhaps the best performance this artist has given at the Royal Opera House. One might say something similar about Peter Rose’s thoroughly excellent Daland, which is vividly sung and comprehensively well acted. In such strong company Ed Lyon’s hunky Steersman fleshes out a secondary role, and he seems to enjoy the horseplay in the final scene.An expanded chorus delivers the scene where the crews of the two ships confront each another sonically with almost terrifying vigour. There are a few untidy moments, nevertheless, from the orchestra, and star conductor Andris Nelsons needs to make Wagner’s relatively early score feel less bitty – but overall it’s still a thrilling evening."
382,The Marriage of Figaro,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/the-marriage-of-figaro-13/,The Marriage of Figaro,,The Marriage of Figaro,,2015-02-02,The Stage,"Mozart’s popular comedy takes to the Opera North stage in a new production by Jo Davies, who has already given the company major hits with Ruddigore and Carousel. She is similarly successful this time around.The opera is sung in Jeremy Sams’ witty English translation, without surtitles: one doesn’t really need them, so clear is the diction of a cast several of whose members are not native English-speakers.Quirijn de Lang, for instance, who hails from Holland, sings a suave and expert Count, reacting with credible annoyance to the constant frustration of his plans by his wife and servants. Romanian soprano Ana Maria Labin offers a gently lyrical Countess, while the Norwegian Silvia Moi is the stylish Susanna. All three – as well as their colleagues – make the best possible case for performing comedies in the language of the audience: one hears a good deal of laughter.The visual setting is apparently Russia in the years leading up to the Revolution: the Almavivas’ palace appears at first and occasionally afterwards to be no more than an artificial stage set; but in more realistic terms its dilapidation suggests that money is tight.But it’s the detail of the production that stands out. Figaro notoriously has a complex plot – full of small moments in the action that signify major changes in the comedy’s overall direction. Davies notices all of them. Her staging is a joyous achievement.The show is excellent on a musical level, too, with standout vocal and dramatic performances also from Helen Sherman’s boyish Cherubino, Henry Waddington’s bumptious Bartolo, Gaynor Keeble’s genuinely sympathetic Marcellina and Joseph Shovelton’s gossipy Basilio. At the centre stands Richard Burkhard’s genial Figaro, a live-wire interpretation around whom the action revolves.Musically, things are in the capable hands of conductor Alexander Shelley, who keeps the score perfectly on the move."
383,La Traviata,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/la-traviata-10/,La Traviata,,La Traviata,,2015-02-02,George Hall,"Every opera company hopes to gain for its repertoire a successful Traviata – a valuable asset, as the piece seems to be endlessly popular with audiences, including newcomers to the form. In Alessandro Talevi’s staging, originally presented last autumn and here enjoying its first revival, Opera North has achieved something that is not far from ideal.Madeleine Boyd’s designs suggest Paris in the 1890s – a few decades on from the real setting of this partially true story, but not an alteration of period that in any way diminishes the narrative’s emotional power. Her costumes for the party scenes in particular are a notable success, with elegant period dresses for the women at Flora’s party contrasting with more outrageous wear at Violetta’s debauch. Talevi never forgets, incidentally, who these people are: far from the implausibly respectable crowd one usually sees on stage in this opera, this is the genuine demi-monde of courtesans and their wealthy lovers at salacious play.Two of the three principals distinguish themselves on all fronts. With relatively little experience of working in lead roles with larger companies, Polish soprano Anna Jeruc-Kopec succeeds in conquering the manifold vocal difficulties of the role of Violetta Valery with her fluent soprano, combining excellent singing with acting of range and imagination. Korean tenor Ji-Min Park proves a fine and sympathetic actor as Alfredo, though vocally his metallic tone is less than ideal. As his father, Giorgio Germont, baritone Stephen Gadd provides a vividly convincing realisation of the part that fully humanises the character.Adding further distinction to the show are some of the smaller roles, with Victoria Sharp’s warm-hearted Flora and Peter Savidge’s menacing Baron Douphol coming over with special impact. The company’s chorus and orchestra have a memorable evening under the spirited baton of conductor Oliver von Dohnanyi.Verdict: Verdi’s classic of love and death makes an indelible impression in Alessandro Talevi’s beautiful and realistic stagingGeorge Hall"
384,Ines de Castro,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/ines-de-castro-7/,Ines de Castro,,Ines de Castro,,2015-01-23,The Stage,"James MacMillan has cut a whole scene and tweaked the vocal score for this new production of his 1996 opera debut. The result, with MacMillan in the pit and given intense direction by Olivia Fuchs on Kai Fischer’s darkening set, is a strongly textured if slight static production.Jo Clifford’s libretto, based on a true and tragic tale of the 15th century Portuguese prince Pedro and his Spanish mistress, transfers easily to a more contemporary setting. Yet its throbbing, portentous opening still reeks of ritual with the full chorus crowding in around Stephanie Corley’s headstrong, vulnerable Ines.The first act easily sets out the details, slipping in a deliciously erotic duet between Ines and Peter Wedd’s Pedro, abruptly disrupted by Paul Carey Jones, who is superb as the puffed-up functionary Pacheco, adviser to the king and hater of all things Spanish. It is in the second act in which the production flexes its emotional muscles. Corley is strong here, too, but is eclipsed by Susannah Glanville as Pedro’s wife, Blanca.Blanca’s descent into madness – enumerating her stillborn babies – is the vocal highlight of the production, a perfect blend of emotion, music and performance. Carey Jones displays eye-watering brutality when Pacheco explains his reasons for hating Ines. And Gary Griffiths’ Executioner relates, with suitably banal tone, his drawn-out execution of Pacheco.But it is the final scene, with Ines’ exhumed corpse sitting in glory over the Portuguese court, that the dreadful destiny of those who choose war over peace is most eloquently expressed."
385,Andrea Chenier,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/andrea-chenier-8/,Andrea Chenier,,Andrea Chenier,,2015-01-21,The Stage,"Jonas Kaufmann, the world’s most widely admired operatic tenor, returns to the Covent Garden stage in what is the Royal Opera’s first production of Giordano’s historical melodrama since 1985. It’s a piece many audience members adore, even if the critics are often less enthusiastic. The show might be considered a vehicle for him were it not for the presence of the other two leading roles of Eva-Maria Westbroek as Maddalena and Zeljko Lucic as Gerard – considerable artists both.Giordano’s best known score rarely rises to the level of his contemporary Puccini, but it has its set piece arias for the principals, all of whom seize their opportunities. Kaufmann is a considered actor and his singing is never less than thoroughly accomplished and tasteful – not something one can take for granted in a star verismo part. He sings particularly beautifully in the last act, where Westbroek sounds a little tired. Lucic remains bullish throughout.David McVicar’s staging will delight traditionalists in its realism and opulence. Robert Jones’s sets are intricate and grand, Jenny Tiramani’s costumes finely achieved. This is the kind of staging Royal Opera audiences long for but rarely get – it tells the story skilfully without attempting anything profound or revolutionary. But that, too, is its limitation.Conductor Antonio Pappano has the measure of the score and steers it throughout its more inspired and less inspired moments with the same easy assurance. In secondary roles, Rosalind Plowright’s Countess, Elena Zilio’s Madelon and Denyce Graves’ Bersi all make appreciable marks. If the evening fails to generate consistent heat, the opera is more to blame than the performers.  "
386,Orfeo,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/orfeo-9/,Orfeo,,Orfeo,,2015-01-15,The Stage,"This production marked some important firsts – the first collaboration between the Royal Opera and the Roundhouse, the first opera staging by Michael Boyd, and the Royal Opera’s first go at Monteverdi’s opera – the earliest work to be judged a masterpiece in the genre, dating from 1607. If using a new venue succeeds in attracting new audiences – and the work is sung in English on this occasion, in a new translation by Don Paterson – then it will have been well worth the effort.The unusual space is very well served by Tom Piper’s set – a circular disc providing the main platform, with the Orchestra of Early Opera Company occupying the lower level of a two-tier structure behind, with singers on the higher rung. A walkway allows some spectacular entrances and exits for the main players.  Not everything about Boyd’s staging works. The presence of priests gives the show a sense of ritual that is partly undermined by the hyperactive contributions of members of East London Dance, choreographed by Liz Ranken – lively enough though their movement is, there’s just rather too much of it in the first half. Circus interventions directed by Lina Johansson add colour, but can also be distracting; they nevertheless bring the evening to a stunning visual close as Gyula Orendt, singing the title role, is lifted heavenwards while straining to touch Euridice once more.Both vocally and physically, Orendt’s performance is entirely remarkable, not least in that this baritone from Transylvania makes so much of the English text; he surely has a bright future. But there are fine performances also from Mary Bevan as a human Euridice, Susan Bickley as an eloquent Messenger, Rachel Kelly’s memorable Proserpina, James Platt’s strong Charon and Callum Thorpe’s fearsome Pluto – a high standard of singing is maintained, indeed, throughout. Christopher Moulds conducts with alacrity.     "
387,Un Ballo in Maschera,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/un-ballo-in-maschera-8/,Un Ballo in Maschera,,Un Ballo in Maschera,,2014-12-19,The Stage,"German director Katharina Thoma’s first UK production was Ariadne auf Naxos for Glyndebourne, which received a mixed reception. Her second, and her first work for the Royal Opera, is this new Ballo, which replaces an unsatisfactory predecessor. Unfortunately, it’s scarcely an improvement.Verdi wrote his opera about the historical assassination of King Gustav III of Sweden, which took place in 1792. But the Italian censors couldn’t cope with such an incendiary subject, so the scenario was shifted to Boston, where the king became a 17th-century English governor of an American province; so perhaps it’s fair for Thoma to move it yet again. The names used are those of the so-called Boston version, but Soutra Gilmour’s and Irina Bartels’ visuals reference the Austro-Hungarian Empire in its final years, and a well-known assassination that took place in 1914. The result is dark and dour and lacking in variety.No serious point is made of this change in period, however, and instead of coming up with ideas, or at least some detailed characterisations and relationships, Thoma focuses on irrelevant details. Why is the basic setting a dynastic burial vault? Why do the statues on the tombs turn into ghosts? Why does Oscar seduce Renato’s maid when delivering his invitation to the ball? There seems to be no rhyme or reason for such intrusive incidentals.The singing is stronger, but there’s still a tendency for it to be loud and unvaried. Best of the principals is Joseph Calleja, whose unstinting tone makes something memorable of Riccardo. Dmitri Hvorostovsky’s Renato pours out tone all evening; it’s a big and beefy performance, lacking nuance. As Amelia, Liudmyla Monastyrska scarcely acts at all, though her dramatic soprano hits all the notes. There’s a spirited Oscar from Serena Gamberoni and a staunch Ulrica from Marianne Cornetti. Daniel Oren conducts with some sense of Verdian grandeur, but not enough cleanness of ensemble."
388,Tristan und Isolde,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/tristan-und-isolde-4/,Tristan und Isolde,,Tristan und Isolde,,2014-12-08,The Stage,"When it was new, in 2009, Christof Loy’s staging got a rough reception due to sightline problems – patrons in parts of the house could not see all the action. These have been improved, and this revival of one of the most demanding works in the repertoire is received with something close to rapture.Loy essentially keeps the drama simple. The main action takes place front stage, with designer Johannes Leiacker employing sparse settings. Behind a curtain at the back of the stage incidental events are revealed by the pulling back of a curtain – initially, for instance, the formal wedding of Isolde and King Marke is being celebrated. It’s an effective and largely clear device and the production works very well.But what people will remember above all is some very fine singing, and especially the superb Isolde of Swedish soprano Nina Stemme – surely the leading exponent of the role today. Vocally outstanding, she also searches out corners of meaning many exponents hardly notice. Partnering her with tireless vocal strength is American tenor Stephen Gould, whose Tristan presents a less complex individual but whose stentorian tone is a tremendous asset.Also reaching a level of excellence are Sarah Connolly as a richly lyrical Brangane, and Iain Paterson as an eloquent Kurwenal – one of the best things the Scottish baritone has done. More questions arise over veteran bass John Tomlinson’s Marke; with many rough edges around the notes these days, he relies on undiminished presence and expressive power – but it’s no longer an ideal performance. Neal Cooper is a purposeful Melot, while another veteran artist, Graham Clark, makes something memorable out of the Shepherd.Leading what is often an outstanding musical performance is Royal Opera music director Antonio Pappano, who manages to convey all the score’s passion and profundity without ever drowning the singers."
389,The Mikado,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/the-mikado-4/,The Mikado,,The Mikado,,2014-12-03,The Stage,"On paper, The Mikado is an excellent choice for the Charing Cross at Christmas and Thom Southerland, fresh from a slew of fringe theatre musical triumphs is an inspired choice of director. Setting his Mikado in a Japanese fan-making factory in the 1920s, Phil Lindley’s set design has some nice period touches that fuse Western culture with splashes of the East and help inform the narrative.Problems arise in the decision not to amplify the sound, while casting singers who need microphones in order to project. Perhaps to counteract this problem, accompaniment consists of only two pianos and, while this may seem charming in a tiny venue, Sullivan’s rich, evocative score sounds embarrassingly cheap, despite accomplished playing from Dean Austin and Noam Galperin.Leigh Coggins’ Yum-Yum thankfully survives, her billowing soprano soaring across the stalls and bringing warmth to The Sun, Whose Rays Are All Ablaze. Matthew Crowe’s Wand’ring Minstrel Nanki-Poo has plenty of comic value but little vocal strength. Hugh Osborne’s Ko-Ko and Mark Heenehan’s Mikado thrive on comic invention and provide extremely witty revisions to their list songs, however, it is with Katisha’s arrival that the whole production is put into perspective.Rebecca Caine – Les Miserables’ original Cosette, no less – projects both vocally and dramatically. A striking Norma Desmond-like figure, Caine nails the character instinctively, colouring her aria with plenty of comic touches and yet bringing genuine pathos to Alone, And Yet Alive. Caine’s presence lifts an otherwise thin production that requires a much stronger sound to merit this difficult space."
390,The Gospel According to the Other Mary,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/the-gospel-according-to-the-other-mary/,The Gospel According to the Other Mary,,The Gospel According to the Other Mary,,2014-11-24,The Stage,"To a libretto by Peter Sellars based on the Old Testament, the New Testament, the medieval abbess Hildegard of Bingen and the writings of half a dozen politically active and mainly female 20th-century poets, John Adams’ passion oratorio premiered in concert in Los Angeles in 2012. It has subsequently been presented widely in that form, but now, with ENO’s backing, Sellars puts on his directorial hat and gives it its first full stage airing.Taking place within in a sparse, prison perimeter fence set by George Tsypin, the production revives a lot of familiar Sellars trademarks: his communal hand gestures are back, and there’s a fair amount of movement generally, with flex dancer Banks taking centre stage as the Angel Gabriel, and the sung roles of Mary Magdalene, Mary, Mother of Jesus and Lazarus all doubled by dancers – Stephanie Berge, Ingrid Mackinnon and Parinay Mehra respectively.The story is a version of the gospel narrative, seemingly taking place simultaneously in ancient and modern times, with contemporary political struggle again of women in particular foregrounded. The poems hold up the action, though, and the result struggles to get away from its oratorio roots.  The other Mary is Mary Magdalene, whose slightly dubious and peripheral position within the standard Gospel narratives is here pushed to the centre of attention in mezzo-soprano Patricia Bardon’s feisty and passionate interpretation. She’s well matched by the booming contralto of Meredith Arwady as her more practical sister, Martha. Together, as Sellars’ programme synopsis explains, ‘they have opened a House of Hospitality for homeless and unemployed women that survives on donations and small miracles’; indeed the librettist/director’s sense of social engagement suffuses both their actions and the piece as a whole.As a physical entity, Jesus is not represented by a single character; his words are usually sung by a trio of countertenors – Daniel Bubeck, Brian Cummings and Nathan Medley – who form a group of Seraphim conveying the narrative in some of the most immediately appealing music in the score. Elsewhere Adams’ post-minimalist style is much in evidence in writing that frequently shows him at his most subtle and sophisticated, if not necessarily at his most memorable.Despite some engaging individual scenes and some striking performances – Russell Thomas makes an indelible mark singing Lazarus – connecting with the show as a drama is not always an easy thing to sustain. Like other oratorios that ENO has presented in recent times – Bach’s St John Passion, or Handel’s Messiah – the form can prove intractable when transferred to the stage. But there are striking elements, both visual and musical, while the young Portuguese conductor Joana Carneiro makes an auspicious ENO debut in maintaining control of the varied score."

On the other hand, Adina is robbed of her social status over the farmworker cum simpleton Nemorino and the crowds fail to ignite the stage in their excitement over Dulcamara’s miracle potion. Star Italian tenor Vittorio Grigolo may not have that light, lyric quality of some, but he has a warmly seductive tone and not only sings with unwavering passion and agility, but is hilarious in his physical comedy, and deeply touching in his Adina, Credimi and Una Furtiva Lagrima. He delights in gooning around and there’s a priceless jiggly dance that comes out of nowhere. He is well matched by Lucy Crowe’s Adina, proving herself a versatile operatic lead and sharing some credible chemistry. Levente Molnar eases into his cocksure preening as Belcore, Nemorino’s rival, but very soon begins to inhabit his cringeworthy seduction. And then there’s Bryn Terfel’s Dulcamara, a grubby wheeler-dealer with characteristic presence and a patter to match. Daniele Rustioni makes a striking impact in the pit, bringing out the score’s brilliance and colour, but also providing unusually supple accompaniments. "
392,Glare,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/glare/,Glare,,Glare,,2014-11-17,Graham Rogers,"When is the perfect girlfriend too perfect? When she seems always, uncannily, on your wavelength? When she repeats the same perfect moves in bed, night after night? When she can state the exact number of decibels the nightclub soundsystem is pumping out? This, in Soren Nils Eichberg and Hannah Dubgen’s new one-act Royal Opera House commission, is when Alex starts to feel uneasy.An ordinary young man looking for love, Alex Amar Muchhala meets Lea Australian soprano Sky Ingram’s ROH debut in the pub. They immediately hit it off – everything is “perfect”. But his suspicions grow, fuelled by Lea’s unlikely friendship with Alex’s spikey ex Clare Presland, and he can’t cope when his bullish, cynical friend Michael Ashley Riches, a scientist in a futurology laboratory, reveals that Lea is a robot.At least, this is according to the synopsis provided – a potentially compelling narrative fatally undermined by American director Thaddeus Strassberger’s strange decision to start the opera with Alex unwrapping Lea from plastic coverings and unplugging her cables. This own-goal aside, Glare’s exploration of our digital-age obsession with perfection, and human relationships with artificial intelligence, is mature and provocative, offering new thoughts on a Hollywood hot topic. Against Madeleine Boyd’s plain brick and concrete walls, the action is initially taut – the four singers are strong actors and Riches a mean pool shot – but the denouement is merely grim rather than revelatory.Nevertheless, it’s an intense, sometimes disturbing, experience, driven by Danish-German composer Eichberg’s throbbing, techno-infused and melodic score, brilliantly rendered by London chamber ensemble Chroma under Geoffrey Patterson.Verdict: Strongly cast, the success of this gritty ‘AI’ opera is due mainly to its inventive, edgy scoreGraham Rogers"
393,Idomeneo,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/idomeneo/,Idomeneo,,Idomeneo,,2014-11-04,The Stage,"Austrian director Martin Kusej, a leading member of the German Regietheater movement, makes his Royal Opera debut with Mozart’s early masterpiece, set after the end of the Trojan War. Kusej’s vision is inevitably modern, with thuggish Cretans dressed in black and holding Kalashnikovs manhandling their Trojan prisoners within a series of moving block-like rooms; behind all the nastiness, it seems, lies the High Priest of Neptune, played by Krystian Adam with a constant evil smirk on his face.The plot, meanwhile, is in places rewritten: the surtitles not only give us a version often tendentious of the translated libretto, but additional pointers to the action itself. This is one of the boldest interventionist stagings Covent Garden audiences have seen – perhaps accounting for the boos that greet the production team at their curtain call.Unfortunately the result is obscure and at times indecipherable. What is the meaning, for instance, of the group of children in white gym uniforms, again later clutching machine guns? Why do the members of the chorus unwrap dead fish, and then indulge in fish-like swimming movements? Search me.When an opera production feels wilfully perverse, it’s sometimes possible to say that the evening is redeemed by the singing and the music-making. Not on this occasion, when French conductor Marc Minkowski disappoints in what is his local debut, too: until the final ballet sequence the orchestral playing could be neater and tidier, while the choral singing has too many smudgy moments.Of the principals, the best is Matthew Polenzani, who is cogent and eloquent in the title role of King Idomeneo. As his son Idamante, Argentinean counter-tenor Franco Fagioli suffers from poor diction and his fluttery, soprano-like voice will not be to all tastes. Sophie Bevan gives a good account of Ilia, while Malin Bystrom is memorable if vocally uneven as Elettra.  "
394,La Boheme,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/la-boheme-7/,La Boheme,,La Boheme,,2014-10-30,Graham Rogers,"One of the first so-called verismo operas, there is not usually a ‘real-life’ feel to La Boheme – something Jonathan Miller’s 2009 production attempts to address. This is already the fourth outing at English National Opera for his take on Puccini’s romantic tragedy among penniless artists, its updated visuals inspired by Brassai’s photos of 1930s Parisians. Isabella Bywater’s impressive designs are not entirely monochrome, but their subdued tones bring a more realistic, though less festive, feel, matching Miller’s colder view of the work.This time round, the cast mainly consists of young up-comers. Graduating from playing Schaunard in last year’s revival, George von Bergen proves himself a capable Marcello. Californian soprano Angel Blue steps up to her first Mimi, having played Musetta in 2013. Her Mimi has a beautiful smile and statuesque figure Blue is a former Miss Hollywood, but her demure sweetness doesn’t develop into an interesting character; never has Rodolfo’s accusation of Mimi as a “teasing temptress” sounded so unlikely. Vocally, she demonstrates a world-class talent destined for great things.David Butt Philip makes his ENO debut as a fresh-faced Rodolfo. He and his fellow bohemians, all well-characterised, have pleasant voices but with one foot still in the English chorister world. American Jennifer Holloway’s sparky Musetta is naturally fluent, and ENO stalwart Andrew Shore provides masterly comic cameos as Benoit and Alcindoro.Only about 60% of Amanda Holden’s blunt translation is audible. Gianluca Marciano’s conducting is rather straight-laced; on opening night, the ensemble was often ragged. There is no keeping down a good tune, though, and its abundance ensures enjoyment, despite a production that downplays the passion and laughter.Verdict: Angel Blue is a draw vocally but, despite striking visuals, Miller’s romance and fun-free production drains La Boheme of its essenceGraham Rogers"
395,Ottone,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/ottone/,Ottone,,Ottone,,2014-10-20,The Stage,"Ottone is a 1722 opera seria charting the story of the German king Otto Ottone who, while en route to Rome to claim both the throne and his Byzantine bride, Teofane, is almost beaten to both by Adelberto, goaded by his mother Gismonda. The intricate plot is layered with deceit, misunderstanding, betrayal and the revelation that the brigand Emireno is actually Teofane’s long-lost brother. The piece makes an interesting contrast with the levity of its sister ETO production this autumn – another rarity – Haydn’s Il mondo della luna.Handel’s characters are not as keenly drawn here as elsewhere and it’s partly for this reason that Louise Kemeny’s Teofane appears somewhat as an accessory, dramatically, though she sings with agility; while even the formlessness of Adelberto fails to take shape. James Conway brings Matilda a step closer to Ottone, rereading her as the king’s sister rather than his cousin, and in the opening scene there’s the suggestion of an unorthodox mother-son relationship between Gismonda and Adelberto – but neither of these ideas flourish. The main set, by Takis, is a glinting Byzantine apse, whose asymmetrical divide allows both swift entrances and the ability to rotate around to form the exterior.On first night the soloists seemed to warm up as the opera’s drama becomes more static, but the vocal riches are real, with strong performances from Rosie Aldridge’s robustly sung Matilda, Grant Doyle’s rich-toned Emireno and Gillian Webster’s viperous Gismonda, whose Vieni, o figlio devastatingly, and momentarily, reveals her maternal warmth. Jonathan Peter Kenny conducts with a keen ear for dance-like movement and for colouristic mood, and the period-instrument Old Street Band plays with energy and flair.  English Touring Opera website"
396,Life on the Moon,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/life-on-the-moon/,Life on the Moon,,Life on the Moon,,2014-10-20,The Stage,"Joining Handel and Bach on ETO’s national tour is a real rarity, an Austrian’s take on a Venetian tale of an old miser persuaded by a would-be astrologer that he has flown to the moon. Mindful of Cal McCrystal’s part in the success of Richard Bean’s adaptation of Carlo Goldoni’s Il servitore di due padroni One Man, Two Guvnors, ETO plainly hoped that he could apply his particular Midas touch to a fantastical Goldoni libretto set by several composers before Haydn got his hands on it.The original score, which runs for two and three quarter hours in Antal Dorati’s studio recording, has been pared down to manageable proportions for this radically reconfigured English version ‘translated’ by company supremo James Conway and majoring, as you might expect, on physical comedy. Purists will be outraged. One act disappears, a second daughter and her beau have been eliminated and the work’s standout aria is reassigned to another character.Keeping the science fiction angle firmly in context, the set and costume designs by Takis give us a super-bright but recognisably 18th-century country house milieu for McCrystal’s razor-sharp sight gags and some fine singing. Given superb diction all round, no surtitles are required. Andrew Slater uses his dry timbre with real aplomb in the central role of Buonafede, the lascivious buffoon enthusiastically shaken down by his daughter and her maid. There are moments of repose, most notably the moonscape at the start of Act II, but the show should be taken for what it is, a musical tour de farce. The 20-strong orchestra under Christopher Bucknall adopts authenticist manners, never overly polite."
397,The Marriage of Figaro,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/the-marriage-of-figaro-19/,The Marriage of Figaro,,The Marriage of Figaro,,2014-10-17,The Stage,"Fiona Shaw returns to revive her strenuous 2011 production. More worrying than the wealth of contextualising stage business is a muddled visual concept which sets the action in a drab geometric maze with Count Almaviva the minotaur at its heart. The revolve is over-used and the extraneous layers tend to overwhelm real human emotions even when well projected by a youthful cast.Shaw starts with an extra-curricular gag about a bee Peter Cook would have laughed, relegating the score to a supporting role. The costumes and props, initially in period so as to make sense of the opera’s droit de seigneur storyline, turn modern, rubbing in the timelessness of its underlying themes. There’s a vacuum cleaner on stage and Barbarina is portrayed crudely as a drunk. The Count attempts to conceal his erection after being propositioned in the non-existent garden.Several principals take up their roles for the first time. Benedict Nelson’s Count is not permitted his customary elegance, grit entering his timbre. Sarah-Jane Brandon’s lightweight Countess makes a successful transition from Glyndebourne Touring Opera.David Stout’s comedic, suitably resonant Figaro is as engaging as the direction allows. The most remarkable singing comes from the Susanna of Mary Bevan Barbarina in 2011, who was presented with the 2014 Critics’ Circle Award for Exceptional Young Talent Voice after the show. Unfailingly stylish, she combines great diction with acting ability and a natural warmth lacking elsewhere. Samantha Price’s Cherubino shows great potential.In the pit Jaime Martin takes time to recover from initial ensemble problems but Jeremy Sams’ spicy, accessible English translation works wonders."
398,I due Foscari,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/i-due-foscari/,I due Foscari,,I due Foscari,,2014-10-15,The Stage,"Not many 73-year-olds can routinely endure the rigours of stage performance. For Placido Domingo, this comes in addition to his work as general director of Los Angeles Opera. And he’s a conductor too. When the feted tenor decided to explore his lower vocal range five years ago, his first role as a baritone was Verdi’s Simon Boccanegra. Now he plays another Verdian Doge, the ageing Francesco Foscari, whose son Jacopo is falsely sentenced to exile by the Council of Ten for treason. The Doge dutifully stands by his judiciary, in the end losing not only his son but also his seat of power. Domingo doesn’t have much to do on stage but he remains a commanding figure, and although there’s some loss of power in the voice, he connects with the Doge’s conflicting duties as father and leader. Kevin Knight’s designs place the action in a dystopian Venice, the Council meeting in the bowels of the concrete city. Mattie Ullrich’s costume designs are striking, with an almost futuristic twist, but occasionally as with Lucretia’s attendants garish.This is a production of extremes – convicts are brutally handled, and tortured, in the prison; a sinister carnival with acrobats and fire-eaters takes place as Jacopo sets sail into exile; and it’s surely a distraction that, at the end, Lucretia Jacopo’s wife goes mad and drowns one of her sons.Francecso Meli makes a heroic impact as Jacopo, bold and tireless in his singing; likewise Maria Agresta, who readily explores her softer colours. Maurizio Muraro is an imposing Loredano and Rachel Kelly makes a big impression in her small role as Lucretia’s confidante, Pisana. Antonio Pappano is in typically inspired form in the pit."
399,The Trial,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/the-trial/,The Trial,,The Trial,,2014-10-13,The Stage,"Following previous collaborations with heavy-weight American composer Philip Glass most recently In the Penal Colony in 2010, small-scale touring company Music Theatre Wales has pulled off a major coup with its co-commissioned new work based on Kafka’s dark 1914 novel The Trial – this is the first Glass opera to be premiered in the UK.  The filmic backdrops painted by Glass’s melodic minimalism offer a detachment well-suited to Kafka’s nightmarish world. He establishes an unsettling atmosphere with winding chromaticisms and an introverted quality rare in his many previous operas but, despite an occasional whiff of Weill’s Weimar Republic, much of the score is Glass by numbers, little evolved since the 1980s. The 12-strong band plays with confidence under conductor Michael Rafferty’s tight control.Michael McCarthy’s stylised production, with Simon Banham’s frugal set and monochrome, exaggerated costumes, realise the story’s grotesque dream-like nature. Baritone Johnny Herford gives a valiant performance as K, the wide-eyed central protagonist struggling to comprehend his arrest on unspecified charges. The necessity of multiple casting in a small company is a benefit here, the same faces reappearing in different surreal and sinister guises to unnerving effect.Despite some strong ideas, however, there is little dramatic development, and the brutal denouement comes out of the blue rather than as an inexorable conclusion. In comparison, English Touring Opera’s production of Peter Maxwell Davies’s The Lighthouse, experienced in the same venue two years ago, was a masterclass in intimate, grippingly tense storytelling with minimal resources. Unhelped by Glass’s routine score, this production fails to hit home."
400,Moses in Egypt,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/moses-in-egypt/,Moses in Egypt,,Moses in Egypt,,2014-10-06,The Stage,"Stirringly entitled ‘Liberty or Death!’, Welsh National Opera’s autumn season makes a feature of two relatively unfamiliar works by Rossini – though both provided successes for the company back in the 1960s. As with last season’s autumnal Donizetti season, and the company’s spring season combining Puccini’s and Henze’s versions of the Manon Lescaut story, designers are held in common between William Tell and Moses in Egypt, with WNO artistic director David Pountney in charge of both stagings.Written for a season given during Lent in 1818, when secular subjects were deemed inappropriate for Neapolitan audiences, Rossini’s Biblical opera is worth reviving, even if the visuals here are seriously disappointing. The Israelites are costumed in blue and green, the Egyptians in red, yellow and orange: facial make-up duplicates these colours. Artificial hand movements get in the way and acting is often poor.Vocally, things go better. Rossini specialist tenor Barry Banks once again hits the high notes as Moses’ brother, Aronne. David Alegret is uneven as Pharaoh’s son Osiride. He is in love in this altered version of the Biblical tale with Claire Booth’s Jewish girl, Elcia, who gives tremendous value in an arduous role.  Both are victims of the ongoing conflict between Pharaoh – grandly sung by Andrew Foster-Williams – and Moses – somewhat tentatively presented by Miklos Sebestyen. The latter enjoys the advantage of the backing of God in his bid to free the Israelites from their Egyptian slavery.Along the way, we are treated to some of the plagues of Egypt, and a crossing of the Red Sea that could be a good deal more visually spectacular; but as partial compensation there are other notable vocal performances from Christine Rice as Pharaoh’s wife Amaltea and Nicky Spence as the camp but venomous Egyptian high priest, Mambre. Carlo Rizzi conducts with an apparent lack of enthusiasm for the task."

After its initial success, though, this second opera has become a runner-up in the Puccini canon, admired by connoisseurs but not really part of the general repertory; even a long-running 1977 Covent Garden production designed by Ken Adam hasn’t really altered that.All the more welcome, then, is ENO’s first staging of the opera for 50 years in a production in which Richard Jones avoids his usual ironic approach and relates directly to the sincerity of the original and its setting in the American gold rush of 1849. Bar-owner Minnie’s faith in her bandit-turned-hero Dick Johnson alias Ramerrez is taken seriously, and in Miriam Buether’s imaginative sets the whole show has a feel-good factor to which it is impossible not to respond.ENO is lucky in its cast, too. After a first act in which Susan Bullock’s vocal resources sound diminished, she hits fine form, ultimately proving intensely moving as the Bible-reading heroine who rescues her lover from his life of crime. Peter Auty sings Johnson with passionate engagement and looks authentic as the Wild West bandit. American baritone Craig Colclough makes a welcome European debut as Jack Rance, the cold-hearted sheriff who loses out to Johnson in the romantic stakes.Among numerous smaller roles, Graham Clark stands out as seen-it-all barman Nick, while the expanded ENO male chorus is on superb form as the hard-working, hard-drinking miners who worship Minnie as their substitute mother. US conductor Keri-Lynn Wilson leads a proud performance, full of true Puccinian eloquence."
402,William Tell,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/william-tell/,William Tell,,William Tell,,2014-09-22,The Stage,"Productions of Rossini’s last and most ambitious opera are a bit like buses – you wait 20 years and then two come along at once: the Royal Opera presents its own version at the end of the 2014/15 season. But WNO gets in first with a work it used to perform with success back in the 1960s now directed by the company’s CEO and artistic director, David Pountney.Pountney’s recent productions sometimes suggest that his own visual aesthetic got stuck a while back and hasn’t moved forwards. Raimund Bauer’s angular sets and Marie-Jeanne Lecca’s costumes present the work in one-dimensional moral terms, with the chief villain, Gesler, and his henchmen wearing animal heads and their leader, oddly, placed in a wheelchair. Pountney tells the narrative about the famous bowman and the freeing of Switzerland from the Austrian yoke efficiently enough, none of the principals comes fully alive.Best to concentrate on the singing, which has some strong qualities, even if conductor Carlo Rizzi – twice over WNO’s music director, and returning here to work on two Rossini operas for the autumn season – feels a bit lackadaisical on this occasion. David Kempster has done nothing finer than the title role, which he sings and acts with accomplished grandeur. Barry Banks sings his heart out as initially unwilling Swiss patriot Arnold, hitting all his top notes fair and square, though Swedish soprano Gisela Stille is a little chilly and uneven as Arnold’s beloved Austrian princess, Mathilde. Clive Bayley is the black-hearted Gesler and Fflur Wynn makes an attractive character of Tell’s son, Jemmy. It’s enjoyable, if not quite the vindication of Rossini’s fine score one hoped for. Maybe the Royal Opera will have better luck."

Forget the radicalism and physicality that shocked contemporary audiences. We are left with a fantastical harlequinade in day-glo colour. The action is mostly imprisoned within a stripy toybox sent lurching into space during the Act I finale, a coup de theatre that works well from certain seats. If you can take the concept, the associated comic business is handled with aplomb by revival director Thomas Guthrie in what is already the fourth outing for this Moshe Leiser and Patrice Caurier vehicle.Taking centre stage is the virile, high baritone of Lucas Meacham, whose swaggeringly substantial, weirdly attired Figaro seems to have absconded from children’s TV or perhaps a Trevor Nunn musical – he arrives via the stalls. The lovers, both new to Covent Garden, are young enough to convince even in this cartoonish setting. Michele Angelini’s Almaviva is notably fresh and sweet and, until his last big aria goes temporarily awry, very much on top of the role’s technical demands.Mezzo Serena Malfi makes a remarkable debut. Her Rosina is mellow and unsteely, the transition between registers silky smooth, the coloratura realised with unerring skill and confidence. Not for the first time, Alessandro Corbelli’s cantakerous Doctor Bartolo is top-notch, other characters being rendered as out-and-out grotesques.In or half out of the pit is Mark Elder, returning to the show he unveiled in 2005. Placed sufficiently high to be able to help his singers out of awkward corners, he sets challenging tempos. String vibrato is limited, textures are light, and the small band includes a fortepiano and, exceptionally, a set of Italian bells, or sistri.Verdict: The humour is broad and the production unsubtle, but this is a tight and effective crowd-pleaserDavid Gutman"
404,Otello,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/otello-3/,Otello,,Otello,,2014-09-17,The Stage,"David Alden returns to English National Opera with a deracinated Otello that moves the action forward to the 1920s, suggested by Jon Morrell’s period costumes. His not quite unchanging architectural set indicates an older Mediterranean milieu, possibly ecclesiastical in origin but long appropriated for military purposes.The large-scale public space doubles as a windowless interior, much assisted by Adam Silverman’s seriously evocative lighting. No superfluous make-up or stage clutter particularises the suggestion made in the programme booklet that Otello might be “an assimilated Muslim, who has converted to Christianity”; only some questionable semaphore and a demented dancing girl raise hackles early on.In the pit, Edward Gardner begins with coruscating drive, his chorus on roaring form. Coordination falters only later, when Desdemona is hymned offstage. There is, however, less in the way of warmth and flexibility, partly a consequence of the austere production style and the manner in which the show is cast.Leah Crocetto’s intrusive vibrato tends to limit the appeal of her assertive, Yankee Desdemona in a mixed UK debut, while Stuart Skelton’s previous ENO incarnation as Britten’s Peter Grimes hangs over his vocally commanding but chilly portrayal of the moor. He never really convinces as a husband or leader of men. Nor could he be mistaken for an Italian tenor.More orthodox are Jonathan Summers’ sardonic, superannuated Iago and Allan Clayton’s notably mellifluous Cassio. Neither requires the surtitles accompanying Tom Phillips’ English translation. As in all Alden productions, minor roles are carefully delineated to provide social context.

405,Anna Nicole,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/anna-nicole/,Anna Nicole,,Anna Nicole,,2014-09-17,The Stage,"Since its 2011 Royal Opera House world premiere, Mark-Anthony Turnage’s operatic treatment of the tragic life-story of Texan Playboy model and TV personality Anna-Nicole Smith, who died in 2007, has been staged in New York and Dortmund, and now returns for its first London revival.Typically for Turnage, but very aptly here, the score is liberally infused with elements of jazz, pop and Broadway, and brings layers of subtlety and even poignancy to the essentially simple rags-to-riches-to-ruin fable. Pepped along by Richard Thomas’ coarsely fun libretto, Act I unfolds in a straightforward manner, chronicling Anna-Nicole’s journey from white-trash origins, via Walmart, lap dancing and a boob-job, to marrying 89-year-old billionaire J Howard Marshall II superbly sung by Alan Oke. But when the jokes dry up in Act II, as Anna-Nicole’s life descends into a mire of obesity, drugs and death first Marshall then her teenage son, Turnage ensures real emotional involvement. The final image of the now-pathetic star in a body bag, engulfed by a growing menagerie of balletically prowling cameras – one of director Richard Jones’s smartest touches, reminding us of our own culpability – is deeply moving. Eva-Maria Westbroek embodies the title role with boundless energy; the first-rate cast also includes Susan Bickley and newcomer Rod Gilfry. Miriam Buether’s sets are bold and colourful, Aletta Collins’ choreography is brassy, and, under Antonio Pappano, the orchestra negotiates Turnage’s magnificent score with great panache."
406,Xerxes,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/xerxes-2/,Xerxes,,Xerxes,,2014-09-17,The Stage,"Nicholas Hytner’s Olivier award-winning 1985 production of Handel’s Xerxes has aged well, if it’s aged much at all. David Fielding’s designs place the action in an 18th-century London pleasure garden, even making a feature of Roubiliac’s famous statue of Handel for the Vauxhall Gardens. Objets and curios appear in display cases; the mountainous city of Persepolis is an exotic, arid backdrop; the huge topiary winged god, which is wheeled on as Ariodates declares victory for the Persians, is an eye-opening set-piece. The garden’s visitors – stiff, reserved and clad in grey – take in an open-air concert, the tea room and examine artefacts without deriving much pleasure at all; they are served by stone-white, bald-headed statuesque flunkeys. By contrast, real-life passions, rejections and obfuscations are playing out among the main characters.Alice Coote makes her role debut as Xerxes, singing with customary brilliance and playfully underlining the Persian king’s foolish infatuation with Romilda, while showing him capable of inner turmoil. She is easily matched by Sarah Tynan’s Romilda, singing with triumphant brightness and apparently limitless flexibility. Andrew Watts plays Arsamenes with aplomb even if he doesn’t always sound sophisticated when singly loudly in the upper regions. Catherine Young and Rhian Lois give distinguished performances as Amastris betrothed to and overlooked by Xerxes and Atalanta Romilda’s sister, and a rival for Arsamenes’ affections. The ENO orchestra matches the sharp colouring on stage with vivid, energetic and stylish playing under Michael Hofstetter. This production was a key player in the recent Handel opera revival in this country, and in this revival it’s easy to see why.Edward Bhesania"
407,Rigoletto,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/rigoletto-6/,Rigoletto,,Rigoletto,,2014-09-15,The Stage,"This is the seventh revival of a staging that threatens to become as much of a fixture as was Jonathan Miller’s English National Opera production. David McVicar’s conception is famously tougher, and in Simon Keenlyside, singing Rigoletto for the first time at Covent Garden following an acclaimed Welsh National Opera run in 2010, revival director Leah Hausman has a protagonist quite unlike the old-school Italians usually associated with the role. Keenlyside’s voice is in fine fettle, once past an underpowered first act, and his physical volatility chimes perfectly with the production’s edgy look and feel.It may not be pretty, but Michael Vale’s slowly rotating set effectively depicts a world out of joint and on the slide, in public and private. The time zone is non-specific. Corruption persists after all.Perhaps it was always going to be Keenlyside’s night. Still, Brindley Sherratt’s tried and tested, jet-black Sparafucile remains outstanding. Further down the cast list, baritone Duncan Rock, a familiar ENO face, makes an efficient house debut as Marullo and Austrian bass-baritone Sebastian Holecek sounds well, if implausibly youthful, as Monterone.Lithuanian Justina Gringyte strikes real sparks in her brief appearance as Sparafucile’s sister, Maddalena, in Act III. The serious disappointment is Albanian newcomer Saimir Pirgu as the Duke of Mantua. While his voice is promising, the acting seems rudimentary – all open palms and swishing cloak. We are left wondering how Polish-born Aleksandra Kurzak’s exquisite, perfectly pitched Gilda could be so easily ensnared. The one Italian, Maurizio Benini, is to be found in the pit.Verdict: Idiomatic or not, Keenlyside gives it his all and Kurzak shines in a patchy revivalDavid Gutman"
408,The Blank Canvas,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/the-blank-canvas/,The Blank Canvas,,The Blank Canvas,,2014-09-08,The Stage,"“Where has it come from, this dazzling geometric jumble?” So asks the artist Lucy, as she involuntarily sees metrical shapes appear in what she knows to be a blank canvas. But it’s a question that could also be asked of Spyros Syrmos’ abstract score, for a trio of piano, flute and vibraphone. As Lucy comes to terms with her impending blindness she has been diagnosed with Charles Bonnet Syndrome and as she tries to reconcile the two men in her life – her lover Peter an engineer, who died a year ago and Gio her agent and adviser – the score’s busy patterns soon become testing. Though the writing for voices works better, there’s little profiling of the characters and, in the first scene especially, the music obstructs the narrative flow. It’s a shock amid this apparently uncompromising score to hear Peter singing a lullaby, or a waft of dance music as Lucy and Gio recall a New York ball.Librettist Fay Wrixon paints Lucy well, and interposes Peter’s scenes as flashbacks; but certain elements are facile, such as the balancing roles of Peter and Gio in Lucy’s life “You do art. I do home,” Peter remarks; and, in the final scene, Lucy and Gio are suddenly contemplating a cosy future together.The three singers, Melanie Sanders Lucy, Edward Hughes Gio and Edmund Hastings Peter bring the piece off surprisingly well, though: especially Sanders, who displays a wide spectrum of vocal colour as well as credibly playing an absorbed artist facing a distressing condition. A Blank Canvas was the winner of last year’s Flourish award for new writing. Composer and librettist clearly have skills, but this piece isn’t without its problems. "

Funny, insightful songs about the deaths of the Stuart Jameses, Luther’s 95 theses, reformation across the nation and the birth of the kilt are energetically delivered by John Kielty, Gerry Kielty, Jordanna O’Neill and Stanley Pattison – who happily plays the fool throughout.There is a little choreography that the show could probably do without, and the show feels too safe to really change anyone’s ideas on sectarianism. However, as the onion of bigotry is peeled back, and the green and blue core is rooted out, you can’t help but admire both the show and its aims. This is a noble and witty piece that deserves to be seen by a larger audience than the dozen or so in the cavernous St John’s church."
410,Siddhartha – The Musical review at Assembly Rooms,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/siddhartha-the-musical-review-at-assembly-rooms/,Siddhartha – The Musical,Assembly Rooms,Siddhartha,4,2014-08-18,Nick Awde,"Originally created in a Milan prison, this musical has been wowing audiences in Europe and the US and now’s your chance to see what the fuss is about.  No matter that it’s in Italian, after all this is an eminently user-friendly language thanks to the international appeal of opera, Laura Pausini and snappily translated easy-to-see surtitles.Based on the Herman Hesse novel, set long ago in India, Siddhartha abandons his well-heeled background to wander as an itinerant beggar in the search for enlightenment and the secret of self-fulfilment. Accompanied by his companion Govinda he meets the Buddha, whose answers are not the ones Siddhartha seeks for his own personal destiny. Later he learns the art of love from beautiful courtesan Kalama and becomes a wealthy man before renouncing it all to return to the simplicity of the poverty he once enjoyed.Strong-voiced Giorgio Adamo as Siddhartha and Katy Desario as Kamala lead this 23-strong cast who sing and dance their way through a vibrant series of colourful, lush set pieces. Interestingly there’s a gradual style change as the numbers progress – what starts off as ‘world moods’, with Indian tones and pipes, slowly turns to powerful Italian pop-rock, with harmonies and electric guitar chords replacing the synth pads.In this Edinburgh version, Isabella Biffi’s creation works on every level and the catchy verse-chorus songs confidently demonstrate how a more popular style works perfectly within a traditional musical show format – even if it does leaves you longing for more torch songs.An instant crowd-pleaser that hits all the right emotional and production buttons, this is also, from a technical point of view, a superlative example of a large touring show designed to play smaller-sized venues with all the oomph of Wembley Arena."

The Edinburgh run of its show, The City, was cancelled after protestors objected to the fact that Incubator receives partial funding from the Israeli government. However, The Stage was exclusively invited to review the show – a non-political hiphop opera set in the US – at a secret location. It will be the only review that the company receives at Edinburgh.Until recently, productions from Israel as verbal as The City were rare since the country has traditionally exported more movement-oriented shows designed to overcome linguistic barriers. Hatched in English via Incubator’s unique tradition of inclusive theatremaking, The City is an impressive ambassador for the new wave of artistic outreach that has started to emerge from the country.Despite its flashy hiphop/R&B credentials a la Jay-Z/Alicia Keys, themewise this slick musical is proudly old skool in the style of Chandler/Hamnett, belonging as it does to the growing genre of shows set in the ‘City’ where everything happens to be gritty, grimy, monochrome… and deadly. So, meet Joe, a worldweary private detective, and the gallery of characters queuing up to complicate his world with murder and mayhem: mysterious moll Sarah complete with red dress and missing sister, hardnosed cop McMurphy plus assorted edgy lowlifes.Nothing in this film noir whodunit is as it seems – where even the moll admits she’s nothing but trouble. The story of Joe’s misadventures is sung-through, utilising a spectrum of styles that propel each segment of action into the next scene without missing a beat as three actors and two musicians share out 13 roles between them. Drama alternates with dark irony, underpinned by the unexpected use of acoustic guitar and assorted percussion to create a complex soundtrack, blending in mouth trumpet and beatbox.As Joe, Amit Ulman keeps the laconic-with-a-hint-of vulnerability stakes high, confidently underpinning the action throughout. As his sidekick Jack, Omer Havron provides contrast in the guise of straight man – and the duo’s freestyle rap battle turns out to be as comic as it is virtuoso. Dorit Lilien tackles Sarah’s ambiguity by also playing it straight, channelling Sarah’s vacillating sultriness via her clear voice, balanced neatly between lippy R&B and smoky chanteuse.Ulman, Havron and Mor – aka hiphop group The Victor Jackson Show – have created twists and turns of language that delight in unexpected internal rhymes and rhythms. And in eschewing the cliched posturing and vocal quirks associated with hiphop/rap, director Ulman has forged an onstage minimalism – neatly enhanced by Guy Galili’s sparing use of spots – that frames and magnifies the performances.Comment @TheStageEditor Alistair Smith’s view‘Edinburgh should hang its head in shame’‘Holding Israel’s artists to account is absurd’‘Protestors are right to target show from Israel’"
413,La Traviata,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/la-traviata-18/,La Traviata,,La Traviata,,2014-08-13,The Stage,"OperaUpClose’s slimmed-down staging of Verdi’s opera manages to make do with just five singers no separate chorus and a three-piece band – on the first night consisting of pianist/music director Alex Beetschen, clarinettist Sarah Douglas and cellist William Rudge – though as with the vocal principals there are alternative performers on other evenings. Yet such is the sincerity of Robin Norton-Hale’s production, and the all-round flair of the cast singing the director’s own skilful English version, that the result is more involving than many far grander productions of this ever popular work at top operatic addresses.Norton-Hale and her designers transfer the action to the USA in the 1920s – a pretty harmless move, which allows straightforwardly elegant interiors and glamorous costumes to provide the neat visual framework. Within this, the action plays out simply but eloquently. Perhaps for economic reasons, Alfredo’s father Germont becomes a part of Violetta’s demi-monde set – though fortunately that doesn’t seriously imperil the drama.Musically, Harry Blake’s reduction of Verdi’s score is expertly done and finely performed. Louisa Tee offers a sophisticated and glamorous Violetta, credible in her vulnerability and self-sacrifice. Lawrence Olsworth-Peter’s light-lyric tenor fits nicely with his slightly nerdy city-type Alfredo. Of the three principals, James Harrison’s Giorgio Germont is the most vocally accomplished, his striking baritone heard to good effect in his big second-act aria; his, in particular, is a talent to watch. Flora McIntosh makes a good deal of her seen-it-all namesake Flora, while Christopher Jacklin manages an effective double act as the Baron and Violetta’s doctor. Overall, this is a fine show, highly recommendable to operatic novices, though Traviata aficionados will get a lot out of it, too."

The Final Curtain,Bedlam,The Horror! The Horror! The Final Curtain review at Bedlam,4,2014-08-12,Gerald Berkowitz,"For most of its length, this is an inventive, evocative and very funny salute to and loving parody of end-of-the-pier music hall, spiced with some decorous double entendres such as how Mr Cox’s widow misses Cox.From an opening song about the proper utilisation of button hooks through to a demure young lady’s comments on her boyfriend’s uselessness as a farmer (with reference to being hard-up, ploughing and spilling the seed), the puns, songs, bad jokes and one-liners come quickly enough that there is barely time to groan. The character types are nicely delineated and the whole thing is on its way to being a jolly jape when, rather abruptly, the final few minutes introduce a supernaturally dark plot.It’s not a bad twist, and had it been there from the start this could have been a satisfyingly macabre comedy. But coming out of nowhere it merely interrupts the fun without replacing it effectively. Through the main body of the show the evocation of a lost genre, the rapid-fire humour and the sprightly songs are inventive and thoroughly entertaining, but the title and the ending seem to belong to some other script."
415,Rinaldo,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/rinaldo/,Rinaldo,,Rinaldo,,2014-08-11,The Stage,"Robert Carson’s sometimes silly but entertaining take on Handel’s musically supreme fantasy opera returns to Glyndebourne for its first revival. Though packed with many of the composer’s best arias, Rinaldo’s libretto is a bit of a mess, a hasty bastardisation of Torquato Tasso’s 1581 mythologising account of the First Crusade with crowd-pleasing romance and sorcery thrown in. So it’s as a unifying concept that Carson’s English public school reinvention, set in universally familiar classrooms and bikesheds and laden with humour pitched at a summer festival audience out to have fun, best succeeds. It also avoids religious offence: the villainous female chorus quickly shed their burkas, revealing a gang of mini-skirted badasses that even St Trinians’ worst would be impressed by.  In 2011 the heroic title role, here the awkward new boy, was a mezzo-soprano. This revival benefits, dramatically and vocally, from Iestyn Davies – one of the finest countertenors around, who excels equally at anguish, tenderness, virtuosity and – rarely off stage – stamina. A first for Glyndebourne, the cast boasts no fewer than four countertenors – with Davies supreme among them, good as they are. Rinaldo’s love interest, a bespectacled, golden-plaited Almirena, is sumptuously sung by soprano Christina Landshamer, her beguiling ‘Laschia ch’io piango’ like hearing this most famous of arias for the first time. There are strong performances too from Karina Gauvin’s stern matron-cum-leather-clad witch Armida, and Joshua Hopkins’s cape-swirling Saracen King Argante. Returning conductor Ottavio Dantone maintains a lively pace and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment plays with terrific zest. A delightful end to Glyndebourne’s 2014 season."

So it must be time for another musical to show us what schools are like now… enter Craig Christie’s Connected.Kate (Stephanie Hockley) and Michael (Joe Ashman) are the newly separated popular students and Dylan (Richard Lowe) is the geek with no real friends but hundreds of virtual ones. When Emma (Rose Shalloo) turns up and looks like she might upset the school food chain, though, Kate takes action. On Twitter.I’m not sure Disney will be buying the rights quite yet. Pop/rock lyrics rhyming ‘cool’, ‘fool’ and ‘school’ might be right up their street, as might the energetic, young, pitch-perfect cast. But the tunes lack a catchy chorus, go on too long and we can’t imagine Walt approving of the swearing and mentions of blow jobs. Which does make you wonder, what kind of an audience is Connected aimed at? Do they expect adults to come and watch so that they get an idea of what schools are like nowadays? And will adults really come if they can’t also bring their children?"

It’s a rousing addition with the glorious Polynesian polyphonic harmonies warmly filling up the Assembly Hall. But it’s creaky too and while it doesn’t really live up to the moniker it boasts proudly – the Kiwi Les Miserables – it does feel like an amalgamation of blockbuster musicals like Les Mis.Inspired by the true stories of the Samoan people who moved to New Zealand in the early days of immigration, The Factory is set in a South Auckland textile factory and looks at the injustices its immigrant workers face. Set in the 1970s the south Pacific sound is interspersed with disco and funk. It makes for some entertaining numbers with the show proving much stronger in its big ensemble pieces than in its more leaden ballads.The Kila Kokonut Krew throw themselves into the material with panache and there’s a real sense of camaraderie on stage. As the young love interests Milly Grant and Ryan Bennett are sweetly engaging but it’s Paul Fagamalo’s fa’afafine Misilei that nearly steals the show with every fabulous strut."

What looks on the surface to be a song cycle morphs into a fully fledged, if minimal, musical thanks to the scenes and living tableaux enacted by wordless performers. Mime and simple props help to create a park in autumn strewn with torn-up paper leaves, commuters huddled on the subway, winos and lovers vying for the park benches – all bringing to life Jamie’s musings on life with and without her ex.Drawn from songs by New York anti-folk singer-songwriter Jaymay, the songs are finely crafted, delivered by Sophie Gore’s full yet winsome voice. However, a few numbers tend to lack highs and lows dynamically and so sound samey, losing the desired emotional impact. The songs that do impress are those that break out of Suzanne Vega territory and play with other genres – the title number Autumn Fallin’ is simultaneously sweet and soaring, while the addition of choruses from the otherwise silent cast add harmony layers to the deliciously catchy See Green, See Blue.Director Anton Benson ensures that this young cast of nine and band of six make good use of the space, and he shares out vocal duties across the two groups to good effect in this ambitiously conceived show that delights with its simplicity."

There might even be the seeds for an expansion into a full-length and larger cast version here.A would-be novelist is blocked until one of her characters comes alive, though the demure Mills and Boon heroine she had imagined is a 6ft-something, blowsy blonde with an Adam’s apple and a load of attitude. The character tries not only to control the direction her novel takes but to inspire her creator with some of her ballsy energy, and when her magical power extends into the real world the two end up wrestling over both fiction and reality.With titles like A Formula For Love and You Have To Go a Little Crazy, David Kent’s pop-based songs have the catchiness and gently ironic tone of Liza-era Kander and Ebb. Rebecca Ridout gives the novelist just the right level of nerdy cuteness and holds her own against the all-stops-out drag performance of Dereck Walker."

But then for this proto-feminist musical perhaps this is what is intended. Just as Alice Birch’s superb Revolt She Said. Revolt Again uses the idea of a badly behaved play to get us thinking about the idea of a well behaved woman – so Fabulous Creatures in all it’s saggy, messy brilliance gets us thinking about what it means not to adhere to societal ideas of female perfection.Pulling from myriad legends and classic texts – Jane Austen, Greek mythology and X Factor are all referenced – Jessica Sedler, Susanna Fiore, Rebecca Shanks, Tara Siddall and Jenny Grove concoct us a feminist fairytale about learning to stand on your own two feet. Whether portraying the plucky heroine, cackling baddie or feisty fairy godmother, they’re all charming performers.Crafted with TV comedy writer Abigail Burdess and director Dominic Burdess, the structure is sound, if a little ragtag. The book is savvy and funny. Benjamin Cox’s catchy, melodic tunes hint at a new musical theatre talent and the harmonies are lovely. But it feels somewhat dwarfed in the Assembly Checkpoint Hall and the ramshackle style employed begins to wear a little thin by the end."

In love with his classmate, Leopold did anything that was demanded in return for grudgingly bestowed intimacies while Loeb’s thrill-seeking was a cover for his fear that he might not be as unique and superior as he wanted to think.In following the pair from early petty crimes through the murder of a randomly chosen schoolboy and beyond, the musical convincingly traces the power game, with a couple of surprising twists. Danny Colligan as Leopold carries much of the weight as narrator while touchingly capturing the pathos of a slave to love, while Jo Parsons makes Loeb in his aloofness less easy to know until his confidence begins to crack. Directed sensitively by Guy Retallack, the two hold the largely empty stage with authority and hold audience interest and sympathy throughout."

Sung in Christopher Cowell’s English translation, Monteverdi’s work proves a perfect match in scale for that most intimate of the UK’s operatic performing spaces – the Cloister at Iford Manor.Christian Curnyn conducts from the harpsichord seven other members of the Orchestra of Early Opera Company, providing exactly the sound-world – as far as we know – that the work’s first audience would have experienced in Venice back in 1641. The piece proves ideal repertoire for this location. Curnyn’s musical direction, though, is just a little too laid back: a bit more dynamism would not come amiss.The production by Justin Way maximises the potential of the individual performers and tells the story with impressive clarity and punch, negotiating back and forth between the serious and the comic scenes. Kimm Kovac’s designs add atmosphere and colour, while Charlie Lucas’s lighting is finely managed.There are some formidable voices on display. Mezzo Rowan Hellier makes a noble, troubled Penelope, her rich lyric tone a huge asset. She is finely partnered by Jonathan McGovern’s dynamically sung Ulysses, who offers plenty of presence. Singing the role of Antinous, one of Penelope’s unwelcome suitors, Callum Thorpe displays one of the finest bass-baritone voices around at the moment, his tone full and even from the top to the bottom; but there are no weak links in this cast, and it’s a pleasure to see and hear them all – Christopher Turner’s grandly grotesque Irus, Elizabeth Cragg’s striking Minerva, Daniel Auchincloss’s warmly human Eumaeus among them. The result is a delightful evening, perfectly judged to fit its ancient surroundings.George Hall"

Forty new productions take place over a three-week season. Three of the opening night’s four main events covered a range of ideas, and levels of accomplishment. April in the Amazon is a series of life episodes recollected by cabaret singer April sung by the inimitable Lore Lixenberg. Addicted to both coffee and sedatives, April wavers between high-speed staccato patter and the mocking tone of hospital questionnaires. Lixenberg relishes their colouristic effects and carries the piece with her understated, magnetic insouciance.Calculated to Death spotlights government powers to monitor our personal communications, with a text drawn from WikiLeaks documents, including the Comprehensive Trade Agreement and the UK Communications Data Bill. If that sounds dull – well, it is. Even intercut with the voice of the people gleaned from blogs, and mixed with basic electronic effects, the dramatic profile is even flatter than the delivery though the naturally generous bass of James Schouten stands out. A random camera feed from inside the performance space is projected onto one wall, while a display of live tweets, to which the audience is invited to contribute, is displayed on another. Less outwardly innovative but more successful is The Fisherman’s Brides, a series of folk-song-like vignettes introducing the quirky characters of a Highland fishing community. Emily Phillips makes for a gentle but warm-toned Eilidh, a girl idly pondering her former loves, and Linda Hirst poignantly sings Mairi, a woman whose husband is never to return from the sea.

424,Adriana Lecouvreur,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/adriana-lecouvreur/,Adriana Lecouvreur,,Adriana Lecouvreur,,2014-07-25,The Stage,"Holland Park returns to its verismo period specialism with this 1902 romantic tragedy by Cilea, presented here in a new staging by Martin Lloyd-Evans. It seems obligatory these days for every new production at Holland Park as elsewhere to opt for a different period to the one originally stipulated by the work’s creators. Cilea’s story of the real-life 17th-century actress Adrienne Lecouvreur ends up – for no good reason, it seems – in the early 20th-century, perhaps in 1938, when a Franco-German film was actually made of the subject. No serious harm is done, though arguably some of the sense of backstage life is lost if we are apparently in a film studio; but it feels a pointless change. The show looks good, however, in Jamie Vartan’s snazzy designs.It sounds good, too, partly because of the authentically Italianate manner of Manlio Benzi’s conducting, which maintains a fine balance between dramatic thrust and languid lyricism, and partly because of what is a consistently strong cast. Cheryl Barker offers the looks, voice and grand manner needed for the star title-role of the great actress who proves vulnerable in love. Tiziana Carraro matches her nicely as her haughty aristocratic rival, the Princesse de Bouillon, and the two seize their opportunities for squaring up to one another in their bitter fight over the man in the middle. He – Maurizio, Count of Saxony – is delivered with grace and charm by Peter Auty, whose lavish tenor fits the bill perfectly. Stealing several scenes as Adriana’s besotted but ultra-loyal friend Michonnet is Richard Burkhard, in what is a perfectly judged character performance. All in all this is a seriously enjoyable evening: those who don’t know this highly attractive piece should give it a try."
425,Aida,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/aida-4/,Aida,,Aida,,2014-07-23,The Stage,"In its 40th anniversary year, Dorset Festival Opera demonstrates impressive standards in this full-scale production of one of Verdi’s grandest works. Aida is one of two major pieces the company – whose activities have expanded considerably under its artistic director, Roderick Kennedy – performs this season; Fidelio is also in the repertory.Designed by Steve Howell, Paul Carr’s staging of Verdi’s ancient Egyptian opera is broadly traditional. Although the budget cannot be large, there’s grandeur and colour in the sets and considerable energy in the work of the substantial chorus, even if some of their movement looks a touch pointless; their singing, under the direction of chorus director Nicholas Mansfield, is brave and bold – as it needs to be in this opera.Strong work, too, from the principals, even if a couple of them – Suzanne Manuell’s Aida and Lorenzo Decaro’s Radames – need to do further work on their basic stagecraft – at moments, both look physically lost. Vocally, they are much stronger, each with the potential to reach considerable heights in their respective roles.Although she grins a little too often for comfort, Antonia Sotgiu’s Amneris manages the regal manner and sings with dignity and power. Leading the field among the four principals is Mark S Doss as Amonasro – a thrilling stage performer who wastes no opportunity to advance his character and sings with vehemence, he is the star of the show. Among the secondary roles, Jean-Loup Pagesy makes an emphatic King and Charlotte Hewett sounds ideal as the Priestess.Maintaining high musical standards throughout is conductor Jeremy Carnall, who brings dynamism and insight to his task. The result is a production of national rather than merely local appeal.George Hall"
426,Norma,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/norma-2/,Norma,,Norma,,2014-07-21,The Stage,"In certain sections of Bellini’s Norma – a pinnacle of the bel canto repertoire – the music takes on an almost Wagner-esque dramatic intensity, in line with the conflicting passions of the three central characters. But at other times, deep-rooted predicaments appear to be underscored by what can sound like material lifted off the shelf, as if the music and libretto had fallen together haphazardly.It seems in response to the latter feature of disjointedness that Olivia Fuchs has transferred the scenario from the Roman occupation over druids in ancient Gaul to modern-day soldiers at war with a community of hippies. A tall perimeter fence brings an unyielding division between the two groups, and the realism is underlined by lager-swilling soldiers raping some of the women during the overture. The hippies pray rather a lot to the sacred oak tree centrestage, and some of their moon-hailing gestures are alarmingly zombie-like.Yvonne Howard brings depth and credibility to the notoriously taxing title role, winning more with a kaleidoscope of vocal emotion than with lightness or agility. Heather Shipp as Adalgisa is not always as convincing an actor but impressive for her supple vocal richness and peaks of resounding power. Joseph Wolverton lacks the magnetism for the role of Pollione, the occupying leader who wins both Norma’s and Adalgisa’s hearts – and though there’s a scintillating ring to the voice, it presents itself patchily.Other than the two main female roles, what anchors this production is the orchestral playing under Peter Robinson: lovingly balanced, naturally paced and showcasing a body of warm, burnished strings.Edward Bhesania"

Best known for his clever comic-horror piece Frankenstein!! for speaker and orchestra 1978, the 71-year-old Gruber wrote this music-theatre work for the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival back in 1994. According to an interview with Wake-Walker in the programme booklet, it’s not only a comedy about race and diet and an attack on human reality, but also a parody on children’s literature – and has political dimensions as well.Perhaps it tries to be too many things. There’s a lack of focus in the staging, however complex and mad the routines dreamt up for a cast of pigs, oxen, farmers, butchers and hotdogs to take on. The cast works its collective socks off – but there’s a sense that the performers’ effort is producing too few laughs.The score is partly to blame. Gruber is a musical humorist and, if one is being honest, a lightweight. There’s a strong element of parody in the piece – shades of Kurt Weill infiltrate many of the references to a whole range of popular styles – yet the Austrian composer never quite hits his targets on their heads. Bright and busy though all the musical cartooning is, and well played by the ensemble Chroma, it is very rarely memorable.Despite that, Mamoru Iriguchi’s designs – with their endless visual jokes about food and animals – are fun, and there’s an energy to the cast’s rushing around that makes up for the slenderness and even obscurity of the material itself.What is Gloria all about? Search me, but if a cast could save it, then this one could.George Hall"
428,La Traviata,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/la-traviata-19/,La Traviata,,La Traviata,,2014-07-18,The Stage,"The third new production of Glyndebourne’s 2014 season is Verdi’s popular classic, and Tom Cairns’ staging, designed by Hildegard Bechtler, brings the action up to modern times. No real harm is done, and arguably some dramatic immediacy is gained, though the sets and costumes are ordinary in themselves and no real visual difference is made between the Parisian scenes and Violetta and Alfredo’s brief idyll in the countryside.Aletta Collins’ choreography makes little sense of the matadors at Flora’s party. More importantly, however, Cairns directs with clarity and purpose, and the acting performances, particularly from the central trio, are all highly focused.Of the three principals, arguably the best is Tassis Christoyannis’ Giorgio Germont, played with intelligence and sympathy and sung with real bel canto fervour. He makes a special moment out of his second-act aria, Di Provenza. Michael Fabiano is a credibly young and good-looking Alfredo, as ardent a singer as he is a lover.In the star role of Violetta, Russian soprano Venera Gimadieva makes a definite splash in her Glyndebourne debut. She looks absolutely convincing as a call girl to high-society, and acts as capably as she sings; and though not every note is cleanly attacked, the overall impression is good. The smaller roles all come over well.What makes the evening genuinely special, however, is the conducting of Mark Elder, who draws superb playing from the London Philharmonic Orchestra. One of the great Verdi interpreters of our day, Elder has taken careful note of the composer’s markings, and accompanimental figures that sound routine in lesser hands here take on real life and meaning. The result, musically, is a truly memorable performance of an opera that we think we know better, perhaps, than we actually do.George Hall"

Rimsky’s piece is an opera, but it was Diaghilev who introduced it to audiences in Western Europe in the guise of an opera-ballet, with dancers miming the action while vocalists – placed at the sides of the stage – sing the identical roles. It’s an artificial construct, but one reproduced faithfully here, with the famous original designs by Natalia Goncharova reworked in Vyacheslav Okunev’s colourful and fantastic sets and costumes. One hundred years following Diaghilev’s famous staging, the company revives it in style.This late work was banned during Rimsky’s lifetime, and he himself never saw it performed. The reasons for the censor stepping in are obvious: via a darkly enigmatic fairy-tale by Pushkin, Rimsky dresses up a sharp-edged satire on the Tsar and his government, which had recently lost a war with Japan with disastrous consequences for Russian national morale.But the piece is full of light and colour, though there’s an unsettling undertone to the tale of Tsar Dodon, who is presented with the Golden Cockerel by an Astrologer to warn him of invasion, but who nevertheless falls under the spell of the exotic but dangerous Queen of Shemakha.Strong work from the orchestra and conductor Alevtina Ioffe ensure that Rimsky’s brittle but brilliant mechanical toy of a score sounds suitably dazzling. Amongst a hardworking vocal cast, Alexander Tsilinko’s old buffer of a Dodon, Petr Melentiev’s high-flying Astrologer and Olesya Titenko’s stratospheric Queen of Shemakha all stand out.George Hall"
430,La Boheme,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/la-boheme-8/,La Boheme,,La Boheme,,2014-07-10,The Stage,"Forty years after its first night, John Copley’s production of Puccini’s tragic Parisian romance returns yet again for another revival exemplifying traditional operatic values on the way to their best. The Royal Opera has announced that next season’s revival will definitely be the last – so catch it while you can.It’s been an amazing run, and though this is hardly a vintage team on the first night, strong elements will give much pleasure during a double cast revival some of the major stars, in fact, are saved up for Cast 2.Albanian soprano Ermonela Jaho sings Mimi. Too often she sing sharp, maybe as a result of applying too much pressure on the voice – a problem that also afflicts Markus Werba’s otherwise vital and engaging Marcello; but she’s often touching as an actress, if a little contrived.Looking very much the part of the sincere young writer with whom Mimi becomes involved, American tenor Charles Castronovo makes an eminently likable Rodolfo. Of the four central principals, Romanian soprano Simona Mihai creates the biggest splash as a lively, pinpoint-accurate Musetta.Daniel Grice could make more of Schaunard, but Korean bass Jongmin Park delivers a Colline to remember, making a memorable moment out of his famous Coat Song. Of the two old buffers mercilessly tormented by the careless young people, Jeremy White is as strong a Benoit as Donald Maxwell is a fine Alcindoro.Making his Royal Opera debut in the pit is German conductor Cornelius Meister. He’s somewhat clinical in approach, observing the detail while occasionally needing a greater sense of emotional sweep.George Hall"
431,La Fille du Regiment,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/la-fille-du-regiment/,La Fille du Regiment,,La Fille du Regiment,,2014-07-09,The Stage,"Director Jeff Clarke’s bespoke staging for the Iford Festival of Donizetti’s classic comedy moves it from the original 19th century Tyrolean military setting to contemporary California, where the ‘regiment’ that has discovered a baby on the battlefield and brought her up as their joint daughter is now the biker gang that has found and raised a mislaid female child. Aided by Clarke’s own clever English version of the libretto, the rewrite works surprisingly well, Opera della Luna’s founder/director’s off-the-wall sense of humour finding another suitable vehicle in this class-based comedy of hidden identity and high-born origins.The result is an extremely lively show, graced by some excellent acting performances and skilled singing, notably from Suzanne Shakespeare’s Marie, whose fizzy soprano rises to all the high notes with complete coloratura aplomb, and equally from Spanish tenor Jesus Alvarez, who delivers the nine consecutive top Cs of his showpiece aria with absolute distinction; he also supplies charm as Tonio, the Latino immigrant of whom the bikers initially disapprove but whom they eventually take to their hearts as Marie’s true love.Katharine Taylor-Jones has fun as Marie’s putative aunt – in reality mother – socialite Marsha Berkenfield, while a performer with the unlikely name of Anne Onimus takes on the role of the even more snobbish Dulcie Crackenthorpe. James Harrison has a couple of good routines as Marsha’s easily outraged chauffeur and butler, Mr Hortensius, while Adrian Clarke leads the rough, tough gang of bikers as if he had been doing so for years.Anyone who admires the opera in its original form would equally enjoy the revamp – done with huge spirit and affection – while this staging will doubtless make some converts to the Donizettian cause. Toby Purser conducts the 11-piece band, who relay the score via John Longstaff’s finely realised reduction of the original.George Hall"
432,Maria Stuarda,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/maria-stuarda-2/,Maria Stuarda,,Maria Stuarda,,2014-07-07,The Stage,"Donizetti’s 1835 romantic opera on Elizabeth I and Mary Stuart Queen of Scots is based on a Schiller play which, like Shakespeare histories, has a relaxed attitude towards historical accuracy but plenty of compelling drama. Its coup de theatre, a fictitious meeting of the rival queens in which Mary hurls the killer blow ‘Vil bastarda’ referring to Elizabeth’s contested illegitimacy, is electrifying stuff. To succeed, a performance needs two supreme divas and, here, American mezzo Joyce DiDonato – the reigning queen of bel canto, following in the footsteps of legendary Dames Joan Sutherland and Janet Baker – and rising star Carmen Giannattasio, triumph admirably. The light but powerful Italian soprano proves her vocal and dramatic mettle as Elizabeth, the insecure and vindictive villain of the piece who signs Mary’s death warrant and commands Leicester an impressive ROH debut from Spanish tenor Ismael Jordi to watch the execution. DiDonato’s Mary is magnificent; she is fiery, proud, dignified, and sumptuously sung. Her confession duet with British bass Matthew Rose’s staunch Talbot is intensely moving.Directors Moshe Leiser and Patrice Caurier set their seventh ROH production in the present day, almost entirely in a drab gaol. The queens, however, are dressed in period garb, as if transported through time – a mystifying conceit reminiscent of Monty Python and the Holy Grail but without the humorous pretext. It is surprisingly easy to adjust though, and the drama is gripping. Conductor Bertrand de Billy ensures both sparks and tenderness in some of Donizetti’s finest music.Graham Rogers"
433,The Queen of Spades,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/the-queen-of-spades/,The Queen of Spades,,The Queen of Spades,,2014-07-07,The Stage,"It is rare for Grange Park Opera to mount a revival, but this restaging of Antony McDonald’s self-designed 2012 production of Tchaikovsky’s opera turns out to be a worthwhile venture – though it remains a cheek to drop the important pastoral entertainment from the masked ball scene in Act II.  Carefully rehearsed by Peter Relton, the staging is strong in narrative values, a move from the late-18th century original setting to the period just prior to the 1917 Russian Revolution proving surprisingly harmless. McDonald’s sets are cleverly designed for this small stage and also impressively atmospheric; he maximises the space available while keeping a firm eye on the drama. The sheer eeriness of this opera about obsession and ghostly revenge leaps from the stage.Carl Tanner repeats his vocally outstanding Herman; physically, he’s a stiff actor who needs to hone his skills, but his is a magnificent tenor voice that would grace any stage in the world. His potential in repertoire conceived on this vocal scale is surely boundless.Giselle Allen’s Lisa is also remarkably sung and acted with focused intelligence. Anne-Marie Owens looks too young for the role of the Countess, but in every respect she makes the most of it. Stephen Gadd sketches in an effective Yeletsky, Georgian baritone Gocha Abuladze a likable Tomsky.This is a strong evening, too, for Grange Park’s sizable chorus and for the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra in the pit. Most of the thrills and spills of Tchaikovsky’s creepy, neurotic score come over, even if conductor Gianluca Marciano does not quite deliver the required momentum on a consistent basis.George Hall"

There’s a curious moment when he and one of his pupils look at each other and the teacher smiles. But the idea remains undeveloped, and by the second act the eight additional schoolboys are basically employed in moving the sets. It shouldn’t really need pointing out that The Turn of the Screw has quite enough content of its own to explore without adding to it. What is presumably the subsequent history of the house feels an irrelevance.The show’s best elements lie in some of the singing and especially in the conducting of Steuart Bedford, who worked with Britten in the last years of the composer’s career and who brings unmistakable insight and stylistic certainty to his task.Ellie Laugharne is touchingly vulnerable as the Governess. Diana Montague brings bags of experience to her concerned Mrs Grose. Elin Pritchard offers vocal and physical presence aplenty as Miss Jessel. Brenden Gunnell is a memorably sinister Peter Quint. In this production Robin Tritschler sings the prologue – presumably so he can return later on as the prep school science master who doesn’t exist in the original set-up. He does so very well.Like Quint, the two children sport red hair – is there a suggestion of shared genes here? – with Dominic Lynch an alternately innocent and knowing Miles and Rosie Lomas a confident Flora.George Hall"

The composer wrote it when he was just 18, and six years separate it from his first acknowledged masterpiece in the form – Idomeneo. But productions in recent years – notably a spiffing staging by Harry Fehr at last year’s Buxton Festival – have proved it to be far more than a piece of juvenilia; it contains some fine arias and splendid finales.The title is difficult to translate. The heroine Violante has been attacked by her jealous lover Belfiore, who thinks he has killed her. Changing her name to Sandrina after recovering, she becomes a gardener in the home of the mayor Don Anchise. A year or so later, his niece Arminda is to be married from his home. Her fiance turns out to be: Belfiore! The plot is complex, and includes a tricky, dual mad-scene for Belfiore and Violante.To clever designs by Antony McDonald, in which a grand rococo interior is literally falling apart in Act I, only to be more or less demolished by the cast after the interval, Frederic Wake-Walker’s production is fussy and sometimes obscure, but it possesses a theatrical momentum that carries the last two acts along.The cast is strong, with Christiane Karg a passionate Violante and Joel Prieto a dramatically vivid Belfiore. On the first night, Romanian baritone Gyula Orendt, singing Violante’s servant Nardo, was forced to relinquish his arias and ensembles to his colleague Gavan Ring due to a throat infection; both do a brilliant job in difficult circumstances.Rachel Frenkel is a feisty Ramiro, Joelle Harvey a personality-girl Serpetta and Nicole Heaston a flamboyant Arminda, while Wolfgang Ablinger-Sperrhacke has fun with the main comic role of the mayor. Glyndebourne’s new music director Robin Ticciati draws dynamic playing from the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment.George Hall"

A brilliant piece of music theatre when first staged, it comes up fresh as paint this time around, aided by a uniformly excellent cast.Karita Mattila adds the dual role of the Prima Donna and Ariadne to her repertoire. She proves finely suited to both, sending herself up something rotten in the broadly comic Prologue, before going on to sing with power and imagination as the deserted Ariadne in the opera proper.She’s nicely matched by two further fine female artists. Canadian coloratura soprano Jane Archibald runs rings around the tricksy notes Strauss wrote for the entertaining Zerbinetta, while Romanian mezzo Ruxandra Donose brings passionate commitment and rich tone to the earnest Composer in the first half.German-Italian tenor Roberto Sacca has fun with his Tenor in the Prologue, and if he lacks ideal tonal refulgence for Bacchus in the opera’s final scenes, he’s not far off the mark. In smaller roles, Christoph Quest’s clipped Major-Domo, the indispensable Sir Thomas Allen’s fraught Music Master and Markus Werba’s iron-pumping Harlequin all impress – though the latter is part of a strong commedia dell’arte team that also includes Wynne Evans, Paul Schweinester and Jeremy White.Herbert Murauer’s sets continue to register as handsome and there are genuine coups de theatre in watching the entire stage go up and down as we move from floor to floor. Jennifer Tipton’s lighting is sensitively done.With Sir Antonio Pappano’s masterly conducting giving Strauss’s luscious score wit and momentum, the result is an entrancing evening, funny and moving by turns, and not to be missed.

Presenting animals on stage can be perilous, but with the help of Robert Innes Hopkins’ canny costuming there is a concentration here on what humans and animals have in common. The set manages to suggest both the village inn, where the menfolk relieve their boredom by drinking, and the forest itself.The human story of the villagers – perfectly exemplified by Timothy Robinson’s touching Schoolmaster, Henry Waddington’s worldly Priest, Joshua Bloom’s bumptious poacher Harasta and, especially, Grant Doyle’s expertly sung and superbly acted Forester – comes into sharp focus in the foreground.Yet the central animal performances – Claire Booth’s complete realisation of the Vixen, Victoria Simmonds’ knowing yet initially shy Fox, and Bragi Jonsson’s harrumphing Badger – are visualised with style and conviction.Slater also binds the two worlds cleverly together, with the aid of entrancing work by two dancers in particular: doubling the main characters in Maxine Braham’s sensitive choreography, Chiara Vinci dances the Vixen, beautifully offset by Jamie Higgins, who dances the Forester.As well as a plethora of smaller roles, there’s also excellent group work from the pupils of Old Palace School and Trinity Boys Choir as the minor denizens of the animal kingdom.Presiding musically over the show is conductor Garry Walker, who shows a profound understanding of the colours and textures of Janacek’s idiosyncratic writing, and draws exceptional playing from the Garsington Opera Orchestra. It’s an undoubted success for the festival, and a production that will surely win many new admirers for this life-enhancing piece.George Hall"
438,Quartett,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/quartett/,Quartett,,Quartett,,2014-06-19,The Stage,"Premiered at La Scala in 2011 and now receiving its UK premiere, Luca Francesconi’s Quartett is an adaptation of Heiner Muller’s play of the same name, itself inspired by Les liaisons dangereuses. In Muller’s and Francesconi’s versions the characters are reduced to two: the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont, would-be lovers, and sly rivals, driven by depraved sexual mores. Their profound boredom means that their only serious aspiration is death. In John Fulljames’ production, the audience surrounds the stage, drawing us into the action, encouraging us to judge and also forcing us to face each other in a manner that recalls the way Merteuil and Valmont hold a mirror up to each other.Francesconi has created a loud, shouty opera, vocally speaking, with some pre-recording of the solo voices for the series of brief dream-pieces. The intensity of the performances by Kirstin Chavea and Leigh Melrose – claustrophobic, heady, unfiltered – depict a pair who are intimate enough to openly parade their most deplorable features. Melrose in particular enters the role with abandon and sings with great stamina.  In fact, so compelling is the duo’s relationship that the role-play sequences – which see Valmont attempting two conquests – tend to detract from the compelling tension surrounding the central couple. Video projections of human cells multiplying or conquering add little to an already taut drama. Andrew Gourlay in the pit brings clarity to Francesconi’s multilayered score. Edward Bhesania"
439,Manon Lescaut,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/manon-lescaut-3/,Manon Lescaut,,Manon Lescaut,,2014-06-18,The Stage,"Two of today’s leading opera stars take to the stage in Jonathan Kent’s new production of Puccini’s romantic tragedy. No complaints about them. Perfectly matched physically to their roles and to each other, Latvian soprano Kristine Opolais and German tenor Jonas Kaufmann look and sound a dream. Their voices ample and glamorous, they encapsulate the doomed young lovers in their journey to despair in the wilderness of the final scene. It is hard to imagine either of the roles better done.Yet the production itself disappoints. Kent and his designer Paul Brown emphasise a seamier view of the story than Puccini, or the writer of the novel on which his opera is based, would have recognised.The period is the 1980s. Manon is no longer moving between true love and the life of a courtesan, but a sex worker pure and simple; the victimised women of the sex trafficking trade are her colleagues in a setting that is never anything other than sleazy. The whole meaning of Manon’s story is coarsened and deprived of nuance or subtlety. While some of Kent’s best work – his Fairy Queen or Turn of the Screw for Glyndebourne, for instance – suggested a reliable pair of hands, this staging suggests that he has lost the plot.Yet the stagecraft is immaculate and the acting excellent – if only it were clear where the action is set and where it is going from scene to scene. The final two acts are particularly mystifying. There is some applause when the production team comes on stage at the end. There is also a good deal of booing.A mixed evening, then, with musical values once again rising above an iffy staging. Sir Antonio Pappano conducts a splendid account of Puccini’s score, with Christopher Maltman and Maurizio Muraro expert in the secondary roles of Lescaut and Geronte de Revoir respectively.George Hall"
440,Vert-Vert,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/vert-vert/,Vert-Vert,,Vert-Vert,,2014-06-16,The Stage,"Continuing its founder Leonard’s Ingrams’s questing spirit for neglected corners of the repertoire, Garsington Opera gives the UK premiere production of Offenbach’s comic opera Vert-Vert. The title refers to the recently deceased pet parrot, mollycoddled by the young convent school pupils in Saint-Remy, whose role is assumed by the timid Valentin. Two of the girls have illicitly wed a pair of local dragoons, and the assistant headmistress has secretly married the dancing master. The thin plot revolves around Valentin discovering his love for Mimi and the dragoons storming to convent to claim their brides. This is not Offenbach’s most sparkling score, but David Parry conducts Garsington’s first-rate orchestra with precision and style. His new English translation of the text is not always quite as evenly polished. The sumptuous and colourful set and costumes are designed by Francis O’Connor, with the picture-book turreted convent school dominating the stage, its walls revolving to form the dragoons’ inn for Act II, and the whole structure spectacularly opening out to reveal the dance class in Act III. The Act II party is thronged with actors in medieval costume, among them knights, princesses, jesters and minstrels.The principal singers are very strong too. Robert Murray plays Valentin as a naive buffoon, but sings with rapt sweetness in his duet with Mimi. Yvonne Howard is the rich-toned assistant headmistress, Fflur Wyn a crystal clear Mimi. But Geoffrey Dolton stands out as the dancing master Balladon, hilariously elegant and effete, but uncaricatured, and especially impressive in his set-piece demonstration of the history of dance. Vert-Vert may have intrinsic weaknesses, but Garsington has lavished it with such high production values that it becomes irresistible.Edward Bhesania"
441,Don Quichotte,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/don-quichotte/,Don Quichotte,,Don Quichotte,,2014-06-16,The Stage,"Summer opera festivals, such as Hampshire’s Grange Park Opera, often offer more adventurous repertoire than major houses – perhaps because summer audiences are more open to the unfamiliar or, possibly, more concerned with convivial trappings such as dressing up and picnicking – than the opera itself. Whatever the reason, besides such ubiquitous classics as La Traviata, Grange Park’s 2014 season offers a welcome chance to experience Massenet’s 1909 work Don Quichotte.The composer of Thais and Werther identified with Cervantes’ hero, an honourable old knight who refuses to believe chivalry is dead, himself clinging to sumptuous tonality in the face of boundary-pushing contemporaries. So it’s an obvious, but effective, step for director Charles Edwards to present Quichotte as Massenet, a proud but uncertain figure contemplating his place in musical posterity. The ‘giants’ Quichotte tackles in the opera’s most exciting scene are not windmills but a grotesque-headed Stravinsky, brandishing The Rite of Spring.Despite, or perhaps partly because of, a mature bass voice that sours in soft passages, Clive Bayley gives a touching, dignified portrayal of Quichotte/Massenet, excellently partnered by virile baritone David Stout as mordant squire Sancho Panza. The other main role, diva La Belle Dulcinee, Quichotte’s erstwhile but impossible love, is impressively sung by mezzo Sara Fulgoni.Edwards’ set neatly contrasts an Edwardian study with period artificiality for the stage-within-a-stage on which the Quichotte story is presented. The BBC Concert Orchestra revels in the vibrant Iberian parts of the score; the lushness and delicacy of the rest is sometimes short-changed, but overall the sensitive production does justice to this bittersweet, reflective opera.Graham Rogers"
442,Owen Wingrave,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/owen-wingrave/,Owen Wingrave,,Owen Wingrave,,2014-06-16,The Stage,"Founded by Benjamin Britten back in 1947, the Aldeburgh Festival has no true opera house in which to stage the works of the UK’s greatest opera composer, but Neil Bartlett’s sensitive production of Britten’s relatively neglected work, originally written for BBC Television and first broadcast in 1971, nevertheless proves surprisingly effective.In Owen Wingrave Britten stands up for his pacifist beliefs with a story of a man from a soldiering family who turns his back on the life they expect him to follow. The problem is that Britten allows Owen’s opponents – especially his grandfather Sir Philip vividly presented by Richard Berkeley-Steele and his aunt Miss Wingrave terrifyingly sung by Susan Bullock – to emerge as demented caricatures, with no redeeming features to offset their propensity for screaming at their recalcitrant relative.Nor is the score as memorable as Britten’s best works are. It is also surprising that the Aldeburgh Festival plays the work in a reduced orchestration by David Matthews. Admittedly it’s a skilful piece of work, but at this international renowned event one would expect Britten’s own larger-scale version to be performed. Mark Wigglesworth nevertheless conducts the Britten/Pears Orchestra superbly.There are no weak links anywhere in the cast, either, though Ross Ramgobin’s thoughtful Owen, Jonathan Summer’s sympathetic Spencer Coyle, Samantha Crawford’s humane Mrs Coyle and Janis Kelly’s Mrs Julian are particularly notable.A mixed evening, then, offering an often impressive interpretation of a flawed work; Bartlett’s production can also be seen in Edinburgh later on in the summer. But this is also a timely reminder that Aldeburgh needs to create a venue where full-scale operatic stagings of Britten’s works can be presented – something that incoming chief executive Roger Wright, who arrives from Radio 3 and the Proms in September with an excellent track record, will need to think about.George Hall"

The first – Usher House, by the American Gordon Getty – receives its stage premiere, the second – La Chute de la maison Usher, a completion by Robert Orledge of some Debussy sketches written between 1908 and 1917 and left unfinished at his death – its first UK production.Getty’s work is the more interventionist in terms of Poe’s short story – the writer himself becomes a character, replacing the friend of Roderick Usher who narrates the original. Musically, Getty’s inspiration lies firmly in 19th-century music; Mussorgsky, for some reason, keeps coming to mind. Best known as one the richest individuals in America, as a composer 80-year-old Getty’s technical skills prove limited; his wordy opera is competent but unremarkable.The most memorable feature of the show is David Pountney’s staging, which uses video material shot by David Haneke at Penrhyn Castle in north Wales, providing an aptly evocative setting for the Gothic horror writer’s dark imaginings. Jason Bridges’ concerned Edgar Allan Poe, Benjamin Bevan’s neurotic Roderick Usher and Kevin Short’s sinister Doctor Primus all impress.      Potentially more interesting, the Debussy score is as estimated by Orledge roughly 48% the work of the great French composer; yet whatever merits this completion has, we can gain from it only a partial impression of Debussy’s subtle and intricate style.Once again Pountney does a good job in keeping unsettling atmospherics at the forefront of his production, with David Haneke’s videos aptly complementing Niki Turner’s designs. Mark Le Brocq presents the mad Doctor, Robert Hayward the crazed Roderick Usher and William Dazeley his concerned Friend. Taken altogether it’s a worthy evening, even if one hardly expects to see either opera again.Usher House/La Chute de la Maison Usher at the WNO websiteGeorge Hall"
444,Nabucco,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/nabucco-3/,Nabucco,,Nabucco,,2014-06-13,The Stage,"A signature piece for the company, Verdi’s early, Biblical opera returns to Welsh National Opera in a staging by Austrian Rudolf Frey, whose Maria Stuarda on the same stage was poorly received last autumn.Though it has puzzling elements, Nabucco goes much better. Frey and his designers leave location and period vague, though dress is modern and some elements of Jewish religious observance remain in the costuming. One might suppose that the result merely indicates a theatrical space, though a few glitzy elements – wall-to-ceiling gold lame curtains, for instance – provide us with emotional resonances. What is more noticeable is how effectively Frey directs his cast, who know exactly who they are at any given moment and who interact with precision and a surprising degree of humour – given that this is a very serious piece. Bar some enigmatic Peter-Sellars-like hand gestures, movement, too, is precise and effective, with the chorus well handled.They are magnificent throughout, especially in the celebrated Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves, when they re-establish their credentials to be considered the leading operatic ensemble in the UK.No weak links in the central casting, with US soprano Mary Elizabeth Williams an Abigaille to reckon with; tall and physically commanding, she is a fine actress and has all the notes for the part. She gives a star performance, as does her compatriot Kevin Short as Zaccaria, his hefty bass noble and grand. In the title role of the proud Babylonian monarch who challenges God only to be cast down for his blasphemy, David Kempster’s big, beefy Nabucco is on a similar level.Strong, too, are Welsh tenor Robin Lyn Evans in the secondary role of Ismaele and Lithuanian mezzo Justina Gringyte as his beloved Fenena. Chinese conductor Xian Zhang leads the performance to conspicuous and consistent musical success.Nabucco, WNO websiteGeorge Hall"
445,Don Giovanni,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/don-giovanni-8/,Don Giovanni,,Don Giovanni,,2014-06-09,The Stage,"Jonathan Kent’s grey-hued but lively 1950s-set production of Mozart’s dark comedy on the antics and retribution of the titular womaniser returns for its second Glyndebourne Festival revival. Staged at the ideally sized theatre adjoining the Christie family’s South Downs country home, one of the 1934-founded festival’s original strengths was its ensemble casts, an ethos apparently adopted for this revival.The 2010 production has previously boasted such luminaries as Gerald Finley, Luca Pisaroni and Miah Persson; this young cast is comparatively B-list. There are no stars, and few spine-tingling solos – but all have respectable voices, and work superbly as a team, musically and dramatically. Canadian baritone Elliot Madore is a cheeky-chappy Giovanni, lighter than many portrayals. Fearlessly physical, he sings unphased as he scales crumbling walls, leaps from a moving bicycle and nimbly negotiates the gravity-defying crevices of Paul Brown’s imposing hydraulic set. Lenka Macikova’s sparky Zerlina takes vocal honours. Her bright, creamy soprano recalls fellow Slovak Lucia Popp, so it’s good to have her rarely performed Act II duet with Leporello depriving Ben Johnson’s Ottavio of Il Mio Tesoro.Kent’s production is filled with smart touches, such as the onstage wind band in Act II emanating from a temperamental transistor radio. Heinously, however, the three competing ensembles at Giovanni’s Act I party are not represented at all, so Mozart’s brilliantly constructed score goes for nothing.Making his Glyndebourne debut, Andres Orozco-Estrada’s conducting is driven but generally well-paced; the London Philharmonic plays with precision, energy and Mozartean character. As Giovanni is dragged to hell by – as Kent has it – the Commendatore’s reanimated corpse, the climax is both chilling and thrilling.Graham Rogers"
446,Fidelio,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/fidelio-3/,Fidelio,,Fidelio,,2014-06-09,The Stage,"Garsington’s artistic director, conductor Douglas Boyd, takes charge of the first show of the season – Beethoven’s only opera, in a production by John Cox first seen in 2009. Boyd’s deep understanding of the score ensures the highest musical standards and superb playing from the Garsington Opera Orchestra, with the horns carrying off Beethoven’s notoriously perilous writing with particular aplomb.Cox’s staging, which takes place in a complex, multi-level metal installation-type set by Gary McCann, who also supplies the period costumes, proves well worth reviving. Narrative values are high and individual performances strong: the use of Garsington’s gardens for the prisoners briefly to sun themselves in shows the versatility of the venue.Two members of the 2009 cast return – Rebecca von Lipinski’s Leonore and Peter Wedd’s Florestan – and once again earn their place. Lipinski manages the vital trick of playing a woman who has to disguise herself convincingly as a young man, and sings with an ideal blend of the lyrical and the heroic. Though his tenor may not be conventionally beautiful, Wedd is equally credible as her husband – a long-term political prisoner – and sings with strength and passionate commitment.To Darren Jeffery falls the role of one of opera’s most dark-hearted villains, the murderous prison governor Don Pizarro, and he embodies him perfectly, both physically and vocally. Stephen Richardson’s craven Rocco, Jennifer France’s besotted Marzelline, Sam Furness’s tetchy Jaquino and Joshua Bloom’s humane Don Fernando all make appreciable contributions.There is impressive work from the chorus, too, in an opera that relies on it to expound Beethoven’s inspiring message of hope and freedom at its most Utopian. The result is a Fidelio to remember – a fine start to the festival’s fourth season in its stunning pavilion at Wormsley, and its 25th anniversary season as a major event in the UK’s operatic calendar.George Hall"
447,Benvenuto Cellini,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/benvenuto-cellini/,Benvenuto Cellini,,Benvenuto Cellini,,2014-06-06,The Stage,"Berlioz’s first opera fell flat at its premiere in 1838, and has continued to do so at most of its infrequent revivals ever since; yet following his broad success with the same composer’s Damnation of Faust at the Coliseum in 2011, former-Python and film-maker Terry Gilliam has been prevailed upon by ENO to try his hand at opera a second time by staging this intractable material. Against all the odds, he succeeds – and triumphantly so.The plot has two interweaved strands. The 16th-century Italian sculptor is in love with Teresa, daughter of the Papal banker Balducci, who wants her to marry a less talented artist called Fieramosca; meanwhile Cellini’s latest commission – an ambitious statue of Perseus for the Pope – must be cast to the Pontiff’s satisfaction. Romance blends with the notion of artistic genius in this comedy set against the background of the Roman Mardi Gras.Gilliam and his designers begin their carnival during the overture – brilliantly played by ENO’s orchestra under Edward Gardner, who has a wonderful evening – with revellers introducing giant heads into the auditorium and confetti raining down on the audience. The visual treats never stop in a show that combines fantastical spectacle with complex crowd scenes, perfectly matching Berlioz’s extravert score.The singing is excellent, with American tenor Michael Spyres rising winningly to the high notes in the flamboyant title role. His compatriot Corinne Winters makes an appealing Teresa, with Paula Murrihy both dapper and dashing as Cellini’s sidekick Ascanio – here described as his business manager. Willard White dominates the stage in his two appearances as Pope Clement VII.For a piece often written off as a disaster, this is a remarkable transformation. Gilliam, Gardner and the company have turned a notorious turkey into the hit of the season.     George Hall"
448,La Fanciulla del West,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/la-fanciulla-del-west-3/,La Fanciulla del West,,La Fanciulla del West,,2014-06-04,The Stage,"Opera Holland Park’s summer season gets off to a flying start with Stephen Barlow’s new production of Puccini’s opera based on David Belasco’s once famous Broadway hit, The Girl of the Golden West.Given the almost automatic updating operas classic operas receive nowadays, there is no surprise that the period has been moved forwards from the mid-19th-century Gold Rush. Barlow selects the Nevada desert at the time of the testing of the atomic bomb – a period that provides some nifty visuals in the shape of the Golden Nugget Casino in Las Vegas for Act I and a cabin in Las Vegas Heights in Act II.These are fun, but the time-shift makes nonsense of the outrageousness of Johnson planning to steal the miners’ hard-earned gold in the original, or the fact that heroine Minnie is supposedly practically the only woman in the vicinity – in 1951. So skilled is Barlow’s direction that one regrets these slips all the more – had he left the period where it was, he would have had a near perfect show on his hands.The principal performances are all worthwhile. Susannah Glanville may not be entirely vocally secure as Minnie, but she’s touching both in her bravery and her naivety. American tenor Jeff Gwaltney and Tasmanian baritone Simon Thorpe are impressive as bandit Dick Johnson and sheriff Jack Rance respectively, both offering focused vocalism and finely achieved acting performances. The smaller roles go well, with Graeme Broadbent’s Ashby and Laura Woods’ Wowkle particularly memorable.Conductor Stuart Stratford demonstrates an impeccable ear for the detail of superb Puccini’s orchestral writing, and, if he occasionally lets the score’s tension sag a little, both the Holland Park Chorus and the City of London Sinfonia remain on consistently excellent form. The result is an eminently enjoyable evening that can be recommended to connoisseurs and operatic newcomers alike.George Hall"
449,Peter Grimes,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/peter-grimes-3/,Peter Grimes,,Peter Grimes,,2014-06-02,The Stage,"One of the most ambitious of the UK’s opera festivals, Grange Park’s new Britten staging by all round man of the theatre Jeremy Sams shows the company operating on its grandest scale. Although, from a purely sonic point of view, the company’s chorus registers as on the small side, they fill the stage – and the presence of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra in the pit ensures a strong musical foundation. Conductor Stephen Barlow has the measure of the piece, which often sounds overwhelming in this venue, though momentum is fitful, the score not quite driven constantly forward as it needs to be.What we actually see on stage is mostly reassuringly traditional. The opera is officially set about 1830, although these days there is almost always updating involved. Not here, where Francis O’Connor’s costumes identify the period with precision – something also reflected in the extract from the closely contemporary Oliver Twist published in instalments in 1837-9 printed in the programme.Like Dickens’ novel, the opera highlights the abuses of the apprentice system, which become a central theme of Sams’ staging. In a controversial and only partially successful move, he introduces scenes showing Peter Grimes as a child played by Charlie Boyd, the cruelty he suffered at the hands of a master Steven East and his friendship with the equally young Ellen Phoebe Venturi. Visualised during the famous and purely orchestral Sea Interludes, the results detract from rather than add to the show. It was surely deliberate on the creators’ parts that we never really learn the nature or extent of Grimes’ own abuse of his two unfortunate apprentices.On the first night, chief executive Wasfi Kani’s curtain speech alerted the audience to the indisposition of American tenor Carl Tanner, singing the title role while suffering from sinusitis. In the event he sang magnificently, offering a thrilling vocal account of the troubled fisherman; ironically, it was his stiff physical acting that seemed limited.Singing Ellen Orford, his compatriot Georgia Jarman sounds more English, though her cool, slightly distanced performance is less involving than it should be. Stephen Gadd offers a solid Captain Balstrode, but it is in some of the smaller roles that the characterisations really shine, notably Rebecca de Pont Davies’ unhinged Mrs Sedley, Anne-Marie Owens’ full-on Auntie and Clive Bayley’s peremptory Swallow. Top of the range are Andrew Rees’ terrifying Bob Boles – surely he is a potential Grimes himself – and Nigel Robson’s perfectly realised Reverend Adams.   Throughout, O’Connor’s sets, given additional visual resonances by Andrzej Goulding’s videos and Paul Anderson’s lighting, provide a series of apt backgrounds, most impressively of all in the final act, set on the beach at night. Yet, once or twice the workings of the machine producing sea-mist become a little too obvious.    George Hall"
450,Dialogues des Carmelites,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/dialogues-des-carmelites/,Dialogues des Carmelites,,Dialogues des Carmelites,,2014-06-02,The Stage,"First seen in Amsterdam in 1997, Robert Carsen’s gripping production has been widely restaged – in Madrid, Vienna and Toronto, as well as at La Scala, Milan. Based on events that took place during the French Revolution, the opera shows a group of Carmelite nuns accepting martyrdom and eventually being guillotined in a climactic final scene that is simultaneously harrowing and stirring.Within Michael Levine’s stark set and in Falk Bauer’s period costumes, the narrative plays out to gripping effect, focusing on the story of timid novice Blanche, who runs away from her fate but finally returns to join her sisters in death. The excellent Sally Matthews is surrounded by a strong cast, among whom Deborah Polaski’s feisty Prioress, Sophie Koch’s concerned Mother Marie, Emma Bell’s brave Madame Lidoine and Anna Prohaska’s flighty Sister Constance all stand out.Other characters make their marks, too. Thomas Allen is memorable in his brief appearance as Blanche’s aristocratic father. Singing the role of her brother but suffering from a throat infection, Yann Beuron was invalided out following Act I on the first night, but his replacement – Portuguese tenor Luis Gomes, a member of the Jette Parker Young Artists Programme – did a fine job in taking over at such short notice. Alan Oke provides a riveting portrayal of the nuns’ Father Confessor.In collaboration with, among others, Streetwise Opera, the production also features the participation of a 67-strong community ensemble, some of whose members have experienced homelessness, the criminal justice system and long-term unemployment; their appearances as the Parisian populace add considerably to the tensions of the Revolutionary setting.Simon Rattle’s conducting ideally needs more flexibility and sensuousness, though the orchestra has a good night under his firm control. Overall it’s an evening of considerable emotional power, in which a great opera is well served by the company.George Hall"
451,Moses und Aron,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/moses-und-aron/,Moses und Aron,,Moses und Aron,,2014-05-27,The Stage,"In what has already been an ambitious season, WNO’s biggest challenge is this rare production of Schoenberg’s unfinished masterpiece – last given a full-scale staging by a British company when Peter Hall directed it for the Royal Opera back in 1965.One of the work’s major difficulties lies in the prodigious musicianship required by the chorus; here WNO covers itself in glory, achieving an awe-inspiring level of proficiency and attack.Exceptional, too, is Sir John Tomlinson’s abrasive Moses, blustering his way through the protagonist’s ultimately doomed mission – to communicate the nature of God while being unable to articulate it in words; his brother Aron takes the message to the people yet debases it in the process. Taking over the role on the day of the first performance, understudy Mark Le Brocq does a fine job.Directorial duo Jossi Wieler and Sergio Morabito bring this story from the Book of Exodus up to the present day, with a national leadership meeting to discuss a major change of direction. In an interview Tomlinson suggested that Egypt remains the location. Group movement and individual cameos are extremely skilled. The large-scale ballet sequence known as the Dance Around the Golden Calf, though, in which the idol-worship Aron instigates turns into an increasingly violent orgy, is watered down; for most of this substantial segment of the second act the chorus instead watches a film that the real audience cannot see. It feels like something of a cop-out. That said, the replacement action is cleverly realised.Musically, WNO’s music director Lothar Koenigs steers this difficult score along with authority. Despite its challenges, the result is a show that demands to be seen, and a significant success for David Pountney’s artistic leadership. George Hall"
452,Cosi fan Tutte,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/cosi-fan-tutte-10/,Cosi fan Tutte,,Cosi fan Tutte,,2014-05-19,The Stage,"When English National Opera’s production of Mozart’s comedy was originally scheduled, the director was announced as Katie Mitchell. For reasons unknown, she subsequently morphed into Phelim McDermott of Improbable – who had previously given the company a resounding hit with Philip Glass’s Satyagraha and a lesser success with a second Glass score, the Walt Disney bio-opera The Perfect American.Mozart’s subtlest stage work – the first classic opera McDermott has directed – is a very different proposition, and if this staging is hardly one either for the traditionalist or the connoisseur, it provides a lively and entertaining evening, which is surely the first aim of any comic opera production.McDermott and designers Tom Pye sets and Laura Hopkins costumes place the action in the US in the post-war period, and specifically in a Coney Island-like locale, where the two young couples, around whom the action revolves, holiday. This setting gives McDermott the chance to bring in a skills ensemble of assorted sword-swallowers, fire-eaters, acrobats, little people and others, who add to the fairground feel.There’s inevitably too much of them, especially in the Act I finale, but what they do, they do well, and they generally add to the fun of the show. The result is neither a deep Cosi nor a psychologically probing one, but on its own level it works well.It is helped by a solid set of principals, among whom Roderick Williams’ Don Alfonso is impeccable and the others all honourable, especially Christine Rice’s Dorabella and Mary Bevan’s motel-maid Despina. Jeremy Sams supplies the deft translation. Ryan Wigglesworth conducts with a keen sense of momentum.George Hall"
453,Eugene Onegin,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/eugene-onegin-6/,Eugene Onegin,,Eugene Onegin,,2014-05-19,The Stage,"Graham Vick’s 1994 production for Glyndebourne, now receiving its third festival revival, takes an objective view of this bald plot of love and rejection. At Larin’s country estate, a painterly sky is the backdrop to a bed of tall, orderly reeds – the first of several distancing but beautiful abstractions. The neat, two-dimensional view of Tatyana’s bedroom has a cooling effect on the letter scene; when Onegin rejects Tatyana, their pole positions are marked by two chairs placed diagonally, a pattern mirrored when Tatyana later rebuffs Onegin; grandly sweeping curtains between scenes keep the action at arm’s-length.In this framework the singers have to work extremely hard and – even with the support of Tchaikovsky’s turbulent score, to which Israeli conductor Omer Meir Wellber brings energy and clarity – it’s hard to feel emotionally invested. Which perhaps is the point. Tatyana and Onegin have to determine their own fates in a highly internalised, private world. For us, the audience, the contrast between Act 2’s birthday celebration for Tatyana while she is infatuated with Onegin – spirited, natural, homely – and the Act III St Petersburg ball Onegin now enraptured by her – calculated, ironic, cool – perhaps alone points to where the truth resides. Both scenes are minutely observed and choreographed.As Tatyana, Ekaterina Scherbachenko comes into her own in her later, less idealistic guise. Ekaterina Sergeeva is her sister Olga, styled as a coy, fun-loving foil, with shining voice to match. Edgaras Montvidas is an ardent if not entirely vocally suave Lensky, and Andrei Bondarenko’s Onegin is suitably detached and world-weary – a creditable Byronic antihero.Edward Bhesania"
454,Der Rosenkavalier,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/der-rosenkavalier-3/,Der Rosenkavalier,,Der Rosenkavalier,,2014-05-19,The Stage,"Glyndebourne launches the summer festival season with a new production by Richard Jones of Strauss’s popular comedy, with conductor Robin Ticciati undertaking his first assignment as the company’s music director – and with considerable flair. The overall result is a substantial hit for the internationally renowned event, just 10 days following the death of Sir George Christie, who steered its path upwards for many years; the current chairman, his son Gus, remembers him in a moving tribute immediately before curtain up.Sir George would surely have been delighted to see the audience reacting so positively to this latest show. Jones’ sense of stagecraft and gift for drawing exceptional performances from his cast make this one of the sharpest yet also most moving realisations the opera has had in the UK for decades. The visuals – notably the sets by Paul Steinberg, Nicky Gillibrand’s costumes and Mimi Jordan Sherin’s lighting – are extraordinarily accomplished, adding to the wit and atmosphere of the whole presentation.There are some notable performances. Kate Royal may lack an ideal lyrical expansiveness for the role of the Marschallin, but she is a radiant actress and looks marvellous; few sopranos could bring off the opening scene naked, as she so confidently does. As Octavian, Tara Erraught lacks the boyish physique and male mannerisms needed by the Marschallin’s teenage lover, though the Irish mezzo’s voice is rich enough. Teodora Gheorghiu makes a perfectly poised Sophie, while Michael Kraus is superb as her socially ambitious father Faninal; though the evening’s great discovery is the outstandingly sung and acted Baron Ochs of Lars Woldt, who goes right to the top of the class.

455,Tosca,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/tosca-7/,Tosca,,Tosca,,2014-05-12,The Stage,"The first of two casts takes to the stage in the latest revival of Jonathan Kent’s 2006 production, rehearsed by Andrew Sinclair. Like the recent Traviata, from a dramatic point of view it looks a bit sketchy.New to Covent Garden, Ukrainian Oksana Dyka offers a heavy-duty soprano in the title role, with little in the way of subtlety in terms of either vocalism or acting. Italian baritone Marco Vratogna, who sang a loud but effective Amonasro for the company in 2010, sounds more worn as Scarpia, also lacking any suggestion of the character’s aristocratic background; he’s a rough and ready exponent of the role.Altogether more successful is Roberto Alagna’s Cavaradossi. At 50, he looks and sounds as good as he did 20 years ago; indeed, he seems rejuvenated. Never less than skilful in his vocalism, he is equally impressive in his acting. Unsurprisingly, he becomes the opera’s centre of attention – which is not usually the case. One or two of the smaller roles also go well, especially Jeremy White’s Sacristan and Michel de Souza’s Angelotti.Making his Royal Opera debut in the pit is conductor Oleg Caetani. He brings out a good deal of the detail of Puccini’s familiar score, even if his interpretation lacks a broader overview; but it was still one of the evening’s better elements.George Hall"
456,Thebans,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/thebans/,Thebans,,Thebans,,2014-05-06,The Stage,"It has been far too long since English National Opera last presented the premiere of a major new opera by a British composer, but in Julian Anderson’s Thebans the company has undoubtedly come up with something worth waiting for.Indeed, the ingredients looked good from the start. Now in his late 40s, Anderson is one of the most admired British composers of his generation, with a string of remarkable pieces to his credit in the fields of orchestral, choral and chamber music, all of them testifying to technical skills of a very high order. His new opera is no exception.Irish playwright Frank McGuinness is equally distinguished; in addition to a solid body of entirely original work, he has been responsible for successful adaptations of classic texts, including Oedipus for the National Theatre. In producing a libretto for Anderson, he has drawn on Sophocles’ plays King Oedipus, Antigone and Oedipus at Colonus – each of them allotted an act in this succinct opera: so we experience first The Fall of Oedipus, then Antigone, and lastly The Death of Oedipus – an unusual ordering that consciously offers differing perspectives from the past, the future and finally the present.Strong as a narrative, McGuinness’ libretto also sings well. One of Anderson’s most notable achievements is his ability to allow each line to cut through the orchestral texture. His score is well paced, and the composer’s diverse musical language proves an asset in shading in the variety of characters and situations required over the course of three very different dramas. The complex, ambiguous music nevertheless makes an immediate impact. Subtleties abound, yet no open-minded listener will be put off.The evening also provides a notable company directorial debut for Pierre Audi, who has run the Dutch National Opera with imagination for 25 years but whom many London theatregoers will remember from his period at the Almeida back in the 1980s. Working with designers Tom Pye sets, Christof Hetzer costumes and Lysander Ashton of 59 Productions videos, Audi conjures up a stark and brutal ancient world that sets up many uncomfortable modern resonances, while drawing performances of directness and intensity from his first-rate cast.Roland Wood excels as Oedipus, whose tragic stature he encompasses in grand-scale vocalism and focused acting. Susan Bickley presents a memorable characterisation of the initially confident but later panic-stricken Jocasta. Julia Sporsen goes to the heart of Oedipus’s daughter Antigone, who takes centre stage in the opera’s extremely effective closing bars. Matthew Best suggests the sexual and moral ambiguity of the seer Tiresias, while Peter Hoare’s Creon is appropriately sinister and inflexible. Counter-tenor Christopher Ainslie sings the Messenger in the first two acts before achieving greater prominence in the last as Theseus.ENO’s music director Edward Gardner once again shows his mettle in delivering a thoroughly convincing account of the score, while the company’s orchestra and chorus do both themselves and the composer proud.George Hall"
457,La Traviata,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/la-traviata-22/,La Traviata,,La Traviata,,2014-04-23,The Stage,"The first of two casts takes to the Covent Garden stage in the latest revival, by Daniel Dooner, of Richard Eyre’s production – new in 1994 – of Verdi’s classic. It must be hard, especially mid-season, to maintain dramatic vitality in a show that returns year in, year out, with umpteen more or less starry casts in tow, and it has to be said that despite everyone’s efforts the trick doesn’t work this time around. The cast includes some distinguished singers, and a decent conductor is in the pit, but this Traviata is not the moving experience it should be.German soprano Diana Damrau, however, is certainly one of the most accurate exponents of Violetta you will ever hear. She looks elegant – if rather too healthy for a dying consumptive – but she never touches the heart; it’s all perfectly executed, but in this role that’s not enough.In his second assignment for the Royal Opera, Sardinian tenor Francesco Demuro looks the handsome young lover and sings attractively, if without any strong sense of vocal or stage personality. He and Damrau seem only mildly interested in one another.Dmitri Hvorostovsky sings Germont, as he regularly has in this staging since 1996, and indeed he sings his heart out, though once again the essential drama of his big scene with Damrau goes missing; the two scarcely look at one another.Smaller roles are all competently done, with Sarah Pring giving Annina some dimensionality. But Violetta’s party guests seem a desperately respectable lot. Maybe time for a new production, or at least a thoroughly spring-cleaned revival. George Hall"
458,Powder Her Face,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/powder-her-face/,Powder Her Face,,Powder Her Face,,2014-04-03,The Stage,"When it was first performed back in 1995, Thomas Ades’s first opera, to a scabrous libretto by Philip Hensher, made the composer’s reputation while becoming notorious for including opera’s first blow-job. Nowadays, with more than 200 performances worldwide and counting, it’s regarded as a modern classic.It tells the cautionary tale of Margaret, Duchess of Argyll, whose scandalous 1963 divorce involved a photograph of the well-known socialite engaged in a private activity with a gentleman whose face was unseen; the Duchess was later notorious for being thrown out of a classy London hotel where she had lived for months without paying her bill.These events, and the Duchess’s memories, are the basis for a drama in which her Maid, an Electrician and the Hotel Manager – played by Clare Eggington, Alexander Sprague and Alan Ewing – feature prominently; these three singers also take other roles in the piece.Ades’s score remains a brilliant achievement – wild, witty and sophisticated in its use of parody and a wide range of references to other musical styles. Timothy Redmond conducts 15 members of  ENO,/a>’s regular orchestra with assurance.Staged in this large former concrete construction hall in Marylebone, this is the first opera production by the much admired Joe Hill-Gibbins, who presents the material with flair. Ultz’s designs lend the visuals a strong sense of period flavour.Right in the centre of the evening, though, is Amanda Roocroft’s depiction of the Duchess herself, drawn with a surprising degree of sympathy, as well as superbly sung – though as with the other artists the acoustic makes it difficult for her to get words across.George Hall"
459,Prince Igor,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/prince-igor/,Prince Igor,,Prince Igor,,2014-04-02,The Stage,"Borodin’s nationalistic opera based on the reputedly 12th-century epic poem The Lay of Igor’s Campaign is problematic not only in that it lay unfinished at the composer’s death it was completed by Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov, but also in that its drama is stilted. Yuri Alexandrov’s own version for Moscow’s Kolobov Novaya Opera, making its UK debut, doesn’t ease the situation: in downplaying Igor’s escape from the Polovtsians during which he leaves his son Vladimir behind we lose sense of the central character’s failure and remorse. Vyacheslav Okunev’s set and costume designs are detailed and impactful, but the direction is more roughly hewn: principal characters often remain awkwardly in position, while at the opening of Act II, Agunda Kulaeva’s Konchakovna looks uncomfortable in her sensuous, exotic moves. The sequence of Polovtsian Dances, here complete with an axe-wielding dancer and a pair of wrestlers, overcrowd the stage – and contains, inexplicably to me, what seems to be a commedia dell’arte-like troupe, pumpkin-bellied and draped in red from head to toe. To striking effect, though, Yaroslavna’s turmoil at the start of Act IV is enacted abstractly and beautifully by five ghostly dancers behind a cloud-covered gauze the magic of this was slightly marred on first night, however, by backstage disturbances.It’s true that this is an authentically Russian style of staging and certainly the same goes for the singing: Kulaeva is a superbly rich-toned Konchakovna while Sergey Artamonov and Evgeny Stavinsky are both vocally resolute as Igor and Galitsky respectively. Aleksey Tatarintsev stands out in the role of Igor’s son, Vladimir, for his ringing, lyrical tenor. Jan Latham-Koenig draws great immediacy and often virtuosic playing from his orchestra, if not always great nuance of colour.Edward Bhesania"
460,L’Ormindo,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/lormindo/,L’Ormindo,,L’Ormindo,,2014-03-26,The Stage,"Having opened just two months ago, the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse hosts its first opera in the shape of Cavalli’s rarely performed L’Ormindo. Dating from 1644, the work represents the beginnings of opera in the commercial theatres of Venice, with a small instrumental ensemble; numerous solo parts involved in a complex intrigue, blending serious and comic; and no chorus. In this initial collaboration between Shakespeare’s Globe and the Royal Opera, the latter’s director of opera, Kasper Holten, stages this unusual piece.The venue itself seems perfectly attuned to such enterprises. The acoustic is excellent, and the intimacy of the auditorium brings the audience up close and personal with the singers; carefully conducted by Christian Curnyn, the eight-piece orchestra plays from the gallery.Sensibly, L’Ormindo is sung in English in Christopher Cowell’s new translation. The complex plot is set in ancient times in what is now Casablanca, where the princes Ormindo and Amidas are both in love with Erisbe, bride of the elderly King Ariadenus.There are persuasive performances from all the principals, with Harry Nicoll’s scene-stealing old nurse Eryka among the most memorable. Holten’s staging revels in the mixing of genres Venetian opera specialised in at this period, and Anja Vang Kragh’s sumptuous costumes highlight the Moorish background. But ultimately the venue is the star of the evening, proving extremely well suited to Baroque opera on this intimate scale. More please.    George Hall"
461,The Commission/Cafe Kafka,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/the-commissioncafe-kafka/,The Commission/Cafe Kafka,,The Commission/Cafe Kafka,,2014-03-18,The Stage,"A joint venture by the Royal Opera, Aldeburgh Music and Opera North brings forth two new chamber operas, with the same pattern to be repeated over the next couple of years. It’s an admirable project, which could potentially instigate something of real value.Here one opera succeeds and the other doesn’t. The failure is on first. Elspeth Brooke’s The Commission is set to a Gothic horror text by Jack Underwood that tells a convoluted tale about a craftsman making a silver locust; he shares his studio with a silversmith and his daughter, who has suffered some sort of terrible trauma. Later the Pope becomes involved, eventually turning into a surgeon who performs a nightmarish operation on the girl’s hand.The result is barely comprehensible dramatically and not helped by a score which is poorly written for both voices and instruments – the latter provided by the ensemble Chroma, skilfully conducted by Richard Baker. It leaves little impression.The evening comes alive after the interval, with Cafe Kafka, a witty fantasy by Meredith Oakes set to music of real imagination and prodigious technical skill by the young Spanish composer Francisco Coll. There’s a touch of unease about the comedy, and even a hint of menace, but as a whole the piece entertains in a sophisticated fashion as staged by Annabel Arden and designer Joanna Parker.Most of the cast appear in both operas, though making a considerably bigger splash with the far better material of the second. My guess is that Cafe Kafka will have an afterlife. Its talented composer deserves a second operatic commission.   George Hall"
462,Die Frau Ohne Schatten,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/die-frau-ohne-schatten/,Die Frau Ohne Schatten,,Die Frau Ohne Schatten,,2014-03-17,The Stage,"Richard Strauss was born 150 years ago, and the Royal Opera’s major contribution to the celebrations is this new production of his most ambitious opera, which also marks the UK debut of German director Claus Guth.The Woman Without a Shadow 1919 is a complex, manufactured fairytale by Strauss’ regular librettist Hugo von Hofmannsthal, set in a magical world where, in order to become fully human, the young Empress, egged on by her sinister Nurse, attempts to tempt the wife of the poor dyer Barak to give up her shadow. How the Empress eventually refuses to take it, and is thereby redeemed, forms the mystical plot.For some Strauss fans, the piece represents the apogee of the composer’s achievement. For others, its sheer weight of portentousness drags the opera down into obscurity. With its replacement of the original setting with a sanatorium where the Empress is apparently recovering or not from some mental illness, and is regularly haunted by beings with animal heads – the latter quite plausibly, since in Hofmannsthal’s scheme the Emperor has hunted her in the form of a gazelle with the aid of his favourite falcon – Guth’s production, designed by Christian Schmidt, provides little help in clarifying what the work is all about.But this is a glorious evening musically, sustained by a superb cast. Russian soprano Elena Pankratova is thrilling as the Barak’s Wife, though she meets her match in American soprano Emily Magee’s tireless Empress. Michaela Schuster’s Nurse is flamboyantly baleful in between. Johan Botha’s gorgeous tenor tone provides the bedrock for his solid Emperor, and Johan Reuter’s focused baritone is perfectly deployed as Barak.But it’s the orchestra’s transparent textures under conductor Semyon Bychkov that are most memorable of all.George Hall"
463,The Magic Flute,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/the-magic-flute-7/,The Magic Flute,,The Magic Flute,,2014-03-10,The Stage,"Joining operas by Britten and Tippett on ETO’s national tour is Mozart’s philosophical comedy, due to play some 17 venues from Truro to Perth between now and the end of May. It’s a user-friendly Flute, not attempting a significant rethink of the original but presenting it as a serious entertainment containing plenty of humour and looking good in Chloe Lamford’s designs; the substantial unit set – a dark blue 18th-century panelled interior – is elegant if sombre. A fixation with standard lamps and lampshades is mysterious, but nevertheless produces some stylish visual moments.ETO’s musical standards have surely never been higher than on the present tour; under the baton of young conductor James Southall both chorus and orchestra are first-rate. Vocally, too, this is an impressive evening from first to last; especially notable are Anna Patalong’s pure lyricism as Pamina, Wyn Pencarreg’s endearing Papageno, Ashley Catling’s focused Tamino, Andrew Slater’s determined Sarastro and Samantha Hay’s feisty Queen of the Night. The smaller groups of characters are all ably done, even though it’s more than obvious that the Three Boys are, on this particular occasion, Three Girls.The work is sung in Jeremy Sams’ crisp translation – surely a good decision for a show that will introduce many not just to this piece but to opera as a whole – and a high proportion of the text comes across, which isn’t always the case these days. All in all it’s a fine achievement, testifying to the excellent condition this invaluable company is in at the moment.George Hall"
464,La Boheme,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/la-boheme-11/,La Boheme,,La Boheme,,2014-03-05,The Stage,"Raymond Gubbay’s big arena production of Puccini’s tale of romance, laughter and tragedy among penniless artists celebrates its 10th anniversary with a welcome return to the Royal Albert Hall.Director Francesca Zambello updates the Parisian setting to the uncertain aftermath of the Second World War in her imaginative, in-the-round staging. Creatively filling the vast space, Peter Davison’s epic set conjures up a railway station, complete with rolling stock in sidings, which comes into its own in Act II – Cafe Momus, on the concourse, has never been more bustling. Merchants sell oranges and silk dressing gowns, prostitutes proposition soldiers, and the Capital Arts Children’s Chorus provide a hearty-voiced throng of urchins. In a whirlwind of Arthur Pita’s slick choreography, customers are served by magnificent roller-skating waiters. By contrast, Andrew Bridge’s excellent lighting achieves intimacy for the bohemians’ apartment.The principal cast is vocally strong, and it is good to hear the opera sung in Italian for the first time in this production. On opening night, Jessica Rose Cambio captures Mimi’s prim cautiousness but not her coquettishness. Sean Panikkar is a serious Rudolfo, Michael Chioldi’s Marcello a reassuring presence, Anna Leese’s Musetta insufficiently extrovert. Thankfully all are into their stride by Act III – the lovers’ emotional quartet, on a deserted railway platform, is the musical and dramatic highlight.  Amplification consigns the Royal Philharmonic’s realisation of Puccini’s sumptuous score to boxy speaker-produced sound. Conductor Oliver Gooch keeps control well, but lack of eye-contact with the cast robs the music of its essential give-and-take – clearly a price worth paying for aural clarity by the thousands-strong audience packed into the RAH for this entertaining and moving experience.Graham Rogers"
465,Arianna in Creta,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/arianna-in-creta/,Arianna in Creta,,Arianna in Creta,,2014-03-05,The Stage,"A regular highlight of the London Handel Festival – now in its 37th edition – is its annual operatic presentation at the Britten Theatre, an ideal venue for such enterprises. This year’s choice is once more a rarity, though Handel’s work about Theseus, Ariadne and the Minotaur was a major success on its first appearance in 1734, with 16 performances in its first season and five the next. These days, many Handel commentators regard it as inferior to the acknowledged masterpieces on either side; Orlando preceded it in the composer’s output, and Ariodante succeeded it.In any event this production makes a strong case for its revival. Designed by Simon Bejer, Selina Cadell’s staging is light-toned but clear, its amusing visual touches never detracting from the narrative. This second of two casts has to tackle some seriously difficult vocal writing, and makes an impressive attempt.Most challenging of all is the role of the heroic Teseo, written for the star castrato Carestini and here sung by Angela Simkin; she shirks nothing, keeping her head while the notes gather thick and fast all around. Perhaps more naturally suited to the coloratura style is Rose Setten as the villainous Tauride, while the evening’s most beautiful voice belongs to Russian soprano Maria Ostroukhova as Carilda. Baritone Morgan Pearse makes a consistently impressive King Minos, while Filipa van Eck charms in the title role and Hannah Sandison registers positively as Alceste. In his regular silent appearances as Cupid, Elliott Rose gives good value.So does the London Handel Orchestra under Baroque specialist Laurence Cummings, delivering the score with consistent style.George Hall"
466,La fille du regiment,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/la-fille-du-regiment-3/,La fille du regiment,,La fille du regiment,,2014-03-04,The Stage,"At this revival of Laurent Pelly’s sparkling production of Donizetti’s sentimental comedy, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa steps into the cameo speaking role of the Duchess of Crackentorp, thus far taken in this staging by Dawn French and – somewhat less capably – Ann Widdecombe. The much loved soprano celebrates her 70th birthday during the run. She looks wonderful and moves with perfect grace, making a welcome return to the stage where she first appeared in 1971 and most recently in 1997.Unsurprisingly, she is greeted with enormous affection, stealing a little of the limelight from the production’s stars – though they surely won’t mind that.Italian soprano Patrizia Ciofi returns to the title role of the baby discovered on the battlefield and brought up by the entire regiment of soldiers as their communal daughter. Her brash, tomboyish manner combines with vocalism of considerable artistry. She’s more than matched by star Peruvian tenor Juan Diego Florez, one of the leading vocal artists of our time, who brings the house down with his spectacular feat of nine consecutive top Cs at the end of his Act I aria. But there’s much more to his performance than this moment of technical brilliance. He’s a charming and focused actor, and sings impeccably all night. You will never see or hear this role better done.But there are other worthwhile contributions, from Polish contralto Ewa Podles’ Marquise of Berkenfeld – another star comic and vocal turn – as well as Pietro Spagnoli’s Sulpice and Donald Maxwell’s Hortensius. Yves Abel conducts an immaculate musical account of what is a thumping good show.George Hall"
467,Rodelinda,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/rodelinda-2/,Rodelinda,,Rodelinda,,2014-03-03,The Stage,"ENO turns again to Handel, offering a new production by Richard Jones of a work considered one of the composer’s finest. Like most Handelian plots, this is a complicated one. The setting is Lombardy in the 7th century, where the villainous Grimoaldo has usurped the throne of the rightful king, Bertarido; the latter has fled abroad, leaving behind his wife Rodelinda and his son Flavio and spreading a false rumour of his own death. How he regains his throne and his family provides the narrative, which also demonstrates Rodelinda’s fidelity and cleverness in putting off Grimoaldo, who wants to marry her.Jones and his designers Jeremy Herbert sets and Nicky Gillibrand costumes move the period forward to 20th-century Italy, perhaps to some episode of internecine strife within a particularly vicious Mafia family. At any rate the result is a complex and disturbing set of visuals, with holding cells and weapons of torture prominent amongst Jones’s armoury. The whole adds up to a striking piece of music theatre, in which the director manages to maintain narrative momentum over what never feels like a long evening.Vital to Handel is quality singing, and you would have to search long and hard to find a Rodelinda as accomplished as Rebecca Evans or a Bertarido as finely-grained as Iestyn Davies: both are superb. But almost equally strong are John Mark Ainsley’s conflicted Grimoaldo, Susan Bickley’s feisty Eduige, Richard Burkhard’s grubby Garibaldo and Matt Casey’s silent but memorable Flavio. Christian Curnyn conducts a fluent, singer-supportive account of the score, while Amanda Holden’s new translation hits the spot.George Hall"
468,Boulevard Solitude,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/boulevard-solitude-3/,Boulevard Solitude,,Boulevard Solitude,,2014-02-27,The Stage,"Welsh National Opera’s Fallen Women season continues with this rare production of Hans Werner Henze’s 1952 opera on the Manon Lescaut theme. Polish director Mariusz Trelinski – who staged Puccini’s work on the same subject to start WNO’s season – returns with many of the same creative team, including set designer Boris Kudlicka and video projection designer Bartek Macias, to bring it to its conclusion.The two shows inevitably look similar, with elements of the set common to both; but whereas Trelinski’s staging felt poorly matched to Puccini’s romantic tragedy, Boulevard Solitude works far better. The result is a powerful evening of music theatre, telling its cautionary tale clearly and effectively.Boulevard Solitude was the first stage opera by the German composer who, together with Benjamin Britten, dominated the post-war operatic scene with a succession of important new scores, and in his case – he died in 2012, aged 86 – continued to do so right up to recent times. Thus far his many operas have not become established repertory pieces, but occasional revivals given to Boulevard Solitude, which British audiences first experienced at Sadler’s Wells in 1962, show that it does indeed possess staying power.Grete Weil’s libretto is a version of the 18th-century love story by the French novelist the Abbe Prevost, already used as an operatic source by Balfe, Auber, Massenet and Puccini – the last two composers achieving long-term successes with the subject. Each tells the story differently, with Weil and Henze retaining the broad outline of the doomed romance between the hapless student Armand a character called Des Grieux in most other versions and his beloved if feckless and money-obsessed Manon, while moving the period forwards to the modern age. Thus the coaching-inn where Manon meets Des Grieux in Massenet and Puccini becomes a railway station in Henze. Boulevard Solitude also represents a darker treatment; during the course of the opera Armand becomes a drug addict, while Manon herself is portrayed as an unfeeling tart on the make. The score, much of it couched in 12-note idiom, may be a tougher nut to crack than Massenet or Puccini, but it is also shot through with a strangely appealing lyricism of its own, plus references to jazz and popular music. Alban Berg is the most obvious influence. The delicacy of the writing, immaculately scored as it is by the composer, remains consistently fascinating. WNO’s music director Lothar Koenigs draws superb playing from the company’s orchestra.The principal roles are well done, even if both Sarah Tynan’s Manon and Jason Bridges’ Armand are sometimes stretched by their high-lying parts. But both give first-rate dramatic accounts, as do Benjamin Bevan as Manon’s brother and pimp Lescaut, and Adrian Thompson and Laurence Cole as Monsieur Lilaque and Young Lilaque, the father-and-son exploiters/victims Manon encounters on her downward spiral into sleaze and criminality.George Hall"
469,King Priam,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/king-priam-3/,King Priam,,King Priam,,2014-02-17,The Stage,"English Touring Opera’s general director, James Conway, is nothing if not ambitious for his company, and its current season is one of the boldest it has yet mounted. It opens with an important revival of Michael Tippett’s second opera, commissioned like Britten’s War Requiem for the festival celebrating the consecration of the new Coventry Cathedral in 1962 – an act of national renewal and international healing.According to Tippett, King Priam deals with ‘the mysterious nature of human choice’. Conway, who directs the production himself, sees in it themes of war and beauty. Both are correct. Right at the beginning of the piece, Priam has to decide whether to kill his newborn son who – it has been prophesied – will cause his father’s death; but the guard entrusted with the task of killing the baby gives it instead to a shepherd. The boy Paris will later be invited to return to Troy and eventually provides the cause of its destruction.Designer Anna Fleischle conjures up a vision of the ancient world in which stark sets are populated by Greeks, Trojans and the occasional god, often wearing flamboyant costumes. Tippett’s austere, sometimes abrasive score is finely articulated under the company’s music director, Michael Rosewell, who conducts a new and skilful reduced orchestration by Iain Farrington. Among a uniformly strong cast there are memorable standouts – Roderick Earle’s dignified, conflicted Priam, Camilla Roberts’ impassioned Andromache, Grant Doyle’s bold Hector, Nicholas Sharratt’s wilful, uneasy Paris, Charne Rochford’s fierce Achilles. The work of the chorus, too, is finely focused. The result is an exceptional achievement, not to be missed as it tours widely this spring.George Hall"
470,Rigoletto,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/rigoletto-11/,Rigoletto,,Rigoletto,,2014-02-14,The Stage,"The opening night of Christopher Alden’s staging marked a significant moment for English National Opera, because it replaced what has been for more than three decades the company’s most famous production: Jonathan Miller’s Little Italy version of Verdi’s classic revenge tragedy, unveiled in 1982.Surprisingly, though, Alden’s staging itself is not actually new: it was first offered to audiences in Chicago as long ago as 2000, and then revived in Toronto in 2011. In a newspaper interview, Alden has admitted that it received a rough ride in both centres, blaming the conservatism of North American audiences.Filling the vast Coliseum stage and replacing the traditional palace of a Renaissance Duke of Mantua proposed in the libretto, Michael Levine’s resplendent set presents the interior of a 19th-century London gentlemen’s club. It looks magnificent, but as the evening goes on, and Verdi and his librettist specify scene changes, none take place.This is not just visually disappointing; it’s also seriously unhelpful to the drama. The opera’s second scene, which is meant to take place in the intimacy of Rigoletto’s lowly home, should offer a complete contrast to the palazzo of the supremely wealthy and all-powerful Duke. Similarly the final act, originally set in a dubious, down-at-heel inn on the outskirts of town, needs to evoke an entirely different atmosphere.  Alden’s rewrite also weakens the identities of the central characters. The aristocratic club members presumably stand in for Verdi’s courtiers. But what makes the Duke so special that all the others are so in awe of him? What exactly is Rigoletto’s function in the club, where he appears to be just another member, as opposed to the Duke’s licensed jester? And would members of such a respectable institution really hang someone on the premises, as they do to Monterone in Act II?Alden’s creative rethinking of classic texts can pay at least partial dividends – as they did in his Midsummer Night’s Dream or Die Fledermaus, both for the same company. Rigoletto, sadly, hasn’t worked out, and I’d be very surprised if this staging were to last more than a fraction of the time Miller’s Mafia version has been around.That said, there are good things about the evening, especially musically. Hawaiian baritone Quinn Kelsey offers a Rigoletto of star quality, his stature and presence adding to the outstanding impact of his voice. An old-fashioned coloratura soprano, Anna Christy makes every one of Gilda’s notes tell. Barry Banks brings energy to the Duke, even if his tone lacks warmth and freshness. Peter Rose’s solid Sparafucile and David Stout’s Monterone also leave a positive impression.Best of all is the conducting of Graeme Jenkins, whose return to the Coliseum sees him demonstrating immaculate Verdian style and drawing thrilling contributions from the orchestra and chorus. It’s just a shame that the production fails to live up to its initial visual promise.George Hall"
471,Manon Lescaut,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/manon-lescaut-5/,Manon Lescaut,,Manon Lescaut,,2014-02-10,The Stage,"Welsh National Opera’s spring season focuses on Fallen Women, as represented by Verdi’s La traviata alongside Manon Lescaut as portrayed both by Puccini in his early opera and by Hans Werner Henze in his Boulevard Solitude. These last two shows are essentially produced by the same team: director of the Polish National Opera Mariusz Trelinski, his regular set designer Boris Kudlicka, and video projection designer Bartek Macias; Magdalena Musial is responsible for Manon Lescaut’s costumes.The original narrative takes place in 18th-century France, but Trelinski moves it forward to a bleak contemporary world; the courtyard of the busy coaching inn at Amiens where the pleasure-loving Manon Lescaut first encounters the penniless Des Grieux becomes the grungy concourse of a soulless metro station. Unfortunately, the black-on-black visuals seem more or less stuck, so that the final scene – originally a wasteland in the US where the heroine, deported as a prostitute, dies – takes both Manon and the audience back to square one. On the way, her elderly admirer Geronte becomes a violently abusive pimp running a sleazy sex bar; in the moving deportation scene, the chorus – originally sympathetic to the plight of Manon and the victimised sex-workers alongside her – turn into complicit ghouls. Something emotionally complex and nuanced has been rendered monochrome and resolutely dark.Decent singing offers some compensation. Chiara Taigi’s substantial Italian soprano helps her define a memorable Manon. Gwyn Hughes Jones’s Des Grieux is solid but more hard-pressed. Conductor Lothar Koenigs points up the score’s colour and vitality – both of them under-represented on stage.    George Hall"
472,Don Giovanni,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2014/don-giovanni-10/,Don Giovanni,,Don Giovanni,,2014-02-03,The Stage,"Back in February 2013, Eugene Onegin – Kasper Holten’s first production for the Royal Opera – took to the Covent Garden stage and duly sank; so it is pleasant to be able to record that the Danish director’s new staging of what is regularly regarded as one of the trickiest of all repertory pieces to realise effectively is a genuine success.Visually this is a fascinating evening. Designer Es Devlin has come up with an endlessly adaptable structure of rooms, staircases and facades that swivels around seamlessly, conjuring an infinity of Escher-like spaces for the action to evolve in. Video designer Luke Halls covers it with a variety of images and colours, starting with the very pertinent one of a handwritten list of the names of Don Giovanni’s lovers/victims, presumably as recorded in Leporello’s ‘not small book’, as he terms it. Anja Vang Kragh’s often flamboyant costumes place the period around 1870. Not everything that happens is readily explicable – Holten’s approach doesn’t always follow the no-nonsense trajectory of a clear linear narrative, but then neither, some would say, does Da Ponte’s libretto – but it is invariably resonant and thought-provoking.Holten is lucky with his cast, led by Mariusz Kwiecien’s suave and sophisticated Giovanni, Malin Bystrom’s grand-scaled Donna Anna and Alex Esposito’s all-too-human Leporello. Also extremely worthwhile are Elizabeth Watt’s perky Zerlina, Dawid Kimberg’s easily manipulated Masetto and Antonio Poli’s sweet-toned Ottavio, while Alexander Tsymbalyuk makes a sonorous Commendatore. Conductor Nicola Luisotti is a flexible exponent of the score, ensuring that musical standards match the dramatic ones.     George Hall"

It was acclaimed on its initial appearance, and although issues remain with aspects of Alden’s treatment of what is fundamentally a naturalistic drama – he steers it at times too far in an uneasily expressionist direction – no one could deny the exemplary commitment and near-perfect dramatic articulation of the entire cast. Despite the hyperactive hand-movements this is a seriously distinguished evening.Musically, in particular, the performance is a reminder of the world-class standards ENO has achieved under Edward Gardner, whose departure from the post of music director at the Coliseum in 2015 has just been announced. He draws unstintingly thrilling playing from the orchestra while the chorus sings up a storm throughout. Few performances of this great work achieve a comparable level of precision and impact.Central interpretations, too, leave nothing to be desired. You would need to search long and hard to find a Grimes to match Stuart Skelton for vocal power or variety; dramatically a more vulnerable Grimes than some, he is musically impeccable. So is South African soprano Elza van den Heever as Ellen Orford, a role she seems to inhabit dramatically while singing it peerlessly. Iain Paterson has done nothing better than this Balstrode, while all of the smaller roles register powerfully. Felicity Palmer surely offers a definitive Mrs Sedley, while Matthew Best’s excellent Swallow and Matthew Trevino’s Hobson both leave an indelible impression. The performance on February 23 is ENO’s first live cinema relay; audiences are surely in for a treat.

Playing on Donizetti’s theme of generational differences, they illustrate their new backstory with a photostory projected onto the curtain during the overture.It’s a trick which sets their stall out perfectly – highlighting the opera’s comedia dell’arte origins, setting up the heightened reality of their production and introducing Pasquale as a cat-lover, allergic to felines but searching for a cure with his friend Dr Malatesta.The updating is bold and adroitly observed. Alfonso Antoniozzi’s Pasquale is a laughable old man who finds relief in his stash of Catwoman comics. Antoniozzi’s characterisation is as detailed as his brusque, slightly arrogant delivery.Aldo Di Toro’s subservient Ernesto could do with a bit more fire in his voice, but it is in keeping with his relationship with his uncle. He clearly does not wear the trousers in his burgeoning relationship with Ruth Jenkins-Robertsson’s Norina. She makes that role her own, with a strong, substantial voice that still dances lightly through the fast passages and a performance that plays deliciously on the cat theme.Nicholas Lester, with a splendidly neat curtain beard, serves well as Malatesta, flattering Pasquale but driving the plot. Their famous Act III patter duet is crisply done – its technical prowess accentuated with speech bubbles over their heads, echoing the earlier photostory.Hilarious yet substantial, with Scottish Opera’s recently departed musical director Francesco Corti returning to the pit for a clear and bright orchestral delivery, this is a real treat.

Stagey and even melodramatic the plot may be, but Puccini’s subtle and inventive score gives it surprising sophistication as well as undeniable emotional power.Designed by Giles Cadle (sets) and Gabrielle Dalton (costumes), Aletta Collins’ staging keeps faith with the original setting in California during the 1850s Gold Rush. Running the Polka Saloon and adored by all the local miners, Minnie is the object of spurned sheriff Jack Rance’s obsessive love – at least until handsome stranger Dick Johnson turns up. The result is an operatic Western with real heart and soul.If Collins’ production gives the piece the credibility it needs, it also benefits from splendid performances in the central roles: Alwyn Mellor’s grand-scale, warmly maternal Minnie is superbly sung. Johnson – who turns out to be the disguised bandit Ramerrez, eventually redeemed by the love of a good woman – is perfectly realised by Rafael Rojas, whose top notes thrill as they must. Robert Hayward’s stature and firm baritone make him an ideal Jack Rance, dark hearted and disappointed in life. The smaller roles are all finely taken, with standouts from Callum Thorpe’s Billy Jackrabbit and Kathryn Walker’s Wowkle – the opera’s Native American couple.Opera North’s versatile music director Richard Farnes scores another hit with his vivid interpretation, bringing out the best from the company’s top-quality orchestra and chorus.

Vocally, she’s touching and, when required, brilliant, a good match for the sympathetic and often dreamily sung Des Grieux of Matthew Polenzani, who rises to the opera’s great tenor moments with aplomb.There’s also a strong supporting cast, led by Audun Iversen’s dramatically dynamic and punchily sung Lescaut, Christophe Mortagne’s amiably rakish Guillot and William Shimell’s urbane De Bretigny. Alastair Miles sketches in Des Grieux’s respectable father with acumen.A long edition of the score is played, but it fully justifies itself in this skilful staging and with the passionate engagement of conductor Emmanuel Villaume. The Royal Opera Chorus is on excellent form, adding some fine cameos to the richly ornate general picture. The ballet sequences go well in Lionel Hoche’s choreography.

Even the original was less than distinguished visually, and this revival is certainly no better than its predecessors. Zambello seems to have thought of the piece more as a musical than an opera, only a musical with poor production numbers. The result is an evening that ambles between the corny and the ineffective. An oddity is the cutting – for no discernible reason – of the opening chorus of the final act.What distinction the show possesses this time around is shared around some of the cast – the first of three, incidentally, in terms of the title role. Georgian mezzo Anita Rachvelishvili repeats at least some of her success at La Scala in 2009, when Bizet’s gypsy launched her international career from nowhere. Sexy and physically magnetic, she provides an imaginatively sung, vividly acted Carmen, while fading curiously into semi-passivity in the last scene. At 50, Roberto Alagna is getting on for her soldier-boy lover, and his singing is rough hewn and almost unsparingly loud, with no attempt at nuance; but in his broad brush-stoke way he gives an acceptable performance.More mixed is Veronica Cangemi’s Micaela, again too mature for dramatic conviction and struggling with the top of her voice in her showpiece aria. Italian bass-baritone Vito Priante sings a small-scale, uncharismatic Escamillo. There’s good work in some of the secondary roles – notably Nicolas Courjal’s Zuniga and Ashley Riches’ Morales. Daniel Oren’s conducting gets the orchestra through the evening but with little sense of style and an unimpressive level of accuracy.

My guess is that they might struggle to follow the piece, which is episodic rather than sustaining an ongoing narrative, and that they might find Philips’ score lacking in the kind of immediate musical ideas such operas inevitably rely on; in the centenary year of Benjamin Britten, it is impossible not to recall how he could write music that appealed to both sophisticated and unsophisticated tastes at one and the same time. Philips’ fussy writing is, unfortunately, rather forgettable.That said, there are good things about the show on other levels. Tom Scutt’s intriguing pallet-based set fills up the bulk of the venue’s adaptable stage, and his costumes are fun even if they only partially suggest the animals they are meant to represent. Natalie Abrahami’s staging is lively and energetic, providing much of the movement and vitality that keeps the evening on the move.Individual performances, too, are strong, with Fflur Wyn’s assignments as the Girl, Polar Bear and Cow all finely achieved, and Njabulo Madlala memorably warm as the Whale and Elephant. Among the small accompanying band, Isla Mundell-Perkins works especially hard as the Cat Violinist. But it’s not quite the magical entertainment it should be, remaining on the ground when it should take off into the air.

Wagner’s final opera proves a tougher nut for him to crack.Working with designer Alison Chitty, Langridge visualises a broadly contemporary community of grail knights, though one whose purpose remains unclear: at the end of the first act, a group of them leaves on what looks like a terrorist mission – most have pistols, one a bomb in a bag. Perhaps referencing a line in Wagner’s libretto when Parsifal himself asks the question ‘Who is the grail’, the grail itself – traditionally imagined as the cup out of which Christ drank at the Last Supper – is here a youth, whose blood is used in for some semi-mystical purpose when his stomach is cut with a knife. He returns, appropriately older, in the third act, yet disappears at the close, when Parsifal supposedly revitalises the dying community; instead it seems to continue to fall apart. There’s something unsatisfying about Langridge’s handling of the whole dramatic scheme, while the designs feel reductive.Several of the individual performances nevertheless rise to considerable heights, especially Gerald Finley’s tense, expressive Amfortas, Rene Pape’s richly lyrical Gurnemanz and Angela Denoke’s strained but compelling Kundry. Willard W White is once again a Klingsor to reckon with. (The character’s self-castration, presented by a double, is one of several moments when plot information is presented in tableau.) Robert Lloyd makes a dignified Titurel, but Simon O’Neill is an awkward exponent of the title role. Antonio Pappano’s conducting is clear in texture, even if its sense of momentum is somewhat erratic.

In 2007 the opera was already 27 years old, the second (following Einstein on the Beach) written by Philip Glass, who has gone on to compose some 20 more.With sets by associate director Julian Crouch, costumes by Kevin Pollard and video design by Leo Warner and Mark Grimmer for 59 Productions, McDermott’s visualisation is close to ideal both in its extraordinary range of theatrical imagination and in its ability to match the detail of Glass’s score. The subject – the development of Gandhi’s peaceful political weapon of satyagraha (‘truth force’) in South Africa around the turn of the 20th century, might sound arcane, and the libretto is sung in Sanskrit; yet such is the power of the staging, as well as the impact of Glass’s haunting repetitions – precisely measured out here by conductor Stuart Stratford – that the oblique rituals of the narrative become mesmerising. This is surely one of the finest productions the current ENO regime has given us.Alan Oke makes a memorable Gandhi, noble in bearing as well as vocal utterance. In the incident when she protects him from a mindlessly mocking mob, Sarah Pring’s Mrs Alexander – the humane wife of the local superintendant of police – registers strongly; but the entire company, as well as ENO’s chorus, is superb throughout this unforgettable evening.

The set consists mostly of handful of sofas, while the large clock in the background ticks away the remaining moments of the courtesan’s existence.Violetta is haunted by the figure of the Doctor (Luigi Roni) warning her that time is short – a memento mori come to life. Alfredo sings his opening Act II solo to her, nonsensically, during some light-hearted sex play. But most of Decker’s ideas – such as having the prurient chorus visually all-male, although including female singers – make a point; certainly this underlines the sex-object status that Parisian society has given Violetta, and which Alfredo temporarily rescues her from. Taken as a whole, this is an undeniably powerful presentation of the old favourite – a Traviata for our times.Especially when sung with the impressive vocalism and interpretative imagination Bulgarian soprano Sonya Yoncheva brings to the title role – here, surely, is a star in the making. She is well supported by Ismael Jordi’s eager, focused Alfredo and Simone Piazzola’s dramatically human and firmly sung Germont, while Zubin Mehta conducts with an insight into Verdi’s writing that few could match today.

Videos by Franc Aleu, mechanically futuristic designs by Roland Olbeter and costumes by Chu Uroz make this a uniquely distinctive visual experience, and at times extremely physical in nature – something scarcely surprising given the theatrical specialisms of the world-renowned company that produced it.Yet in this revival of Die Walkure, musical standards are equally impressive. Zubin Mehta conducts with easy command, drawing superior playing from the first-class orchestra. Nikolai Schukoff fields a bright and confident Heldentenor as Siegmund and is memorably partnered by Heidi Melton’s grandly scaled Sieglinde. Stephen Milling’s Hunding provides plenty of weight and baleful malice. Bringing the evening to an emotionally unforgettable climax, Thomas Johannes Mayer’s Wotan fulfils all the vocal and dramatic requirements of his epic role, while Jennifer Wilson’s Brunnhilde maintains vocal firmness and consistency right through to the final scene.All in all it’s a remarkable Wagnerian achievement, and one of which Valencia can be justly proud.

Until this year they have not tackled any Verdi – this La Traviata is well-timed for the great maestro’s 200th anniversary celebrations.A pragmatic period/location shifter himself (usually to avoid trouble with the censors), Verdi would surely have recognised the essence of his 18th century-set adaptation of Alexandre Dumas’ 1852 novel La Dame aux Camelias in Robin Norton-Hale’s updating to prohibition-era America.Heading a dramatically committed cast, Prudence Sanders’ titular ‘fallen woman’, a bright young flapper, is by turns bubbly and movingly sorrowful – and, unlike many sopranos, she conveys Violetta’s illness with plausible subtlety. Her wealthy lover Alfredo is played with endearing bookishness by Lawrence Olsworth-Peter, and his father, crooked politician Germont, with formidable presence by David Durham.Katie Bellman’s wood-panelled set is, aptly, classier than many other OperaUpClose stagings, but it is its musical values which raise this production to a higher level than most. Music director and pianist Elspeth Wilkes has coordinated the ensemble superbly with well-blended singers who don’t overpower in the intimate space, and Harry Blake’s clever score reduction for piano, clarinet and cello, although lacking the sparkle of Verdi’s orchestration, is far more successful than the company’s Puccini arrangements, and sensitively and idiomatically rendered.Every word of Norton-Hale’s English libretto is conveyed clearly, ensuring a compelling experience which almost makes the stifling airlessness of the King’s Head back room bearable.

For a work that should pack a theatrical body blow, its impact feels surprisingly muted on this occasion, despite conscientious musical standards emanating from the pit, where conductor Mark Elder presides.In the title role of the brutalised and endlessly humiliated common soldier who ends up killing his partner through sexual jealousy, Simon Keenlyside is musically all present and correct, but there’s a sense in which Wozzeck’s sheer ordinariness eludes him. More bumpily sung, and rather too often shouted, is Karita Mattila’s Marie, grasping desperately at life without gaining any purchase on it but also registering as considerably more sophisticated than the downtrodden woman she is playing.Designed by the late Stefanos Lazaridis, Warner’s staging is an artificial, visual construct, its fish tanks and display cases replacing the crude poverty-stricken reality in which the harassed Wozzeck runs restlessly around. The military background is played down almost to the point of disappearing. Many scenes fail to maximise on their potentially devastating material – most notably the chilling close, when a group of kids torment Wozzeck and Marie’s newly orphaned child. Here, ineffectively, they are no more than recorded voices off. Overall, a visceral piece of music theatre feels as if it’s being held at a distance.Secondary performances that might come through more strongly in a better staging – Gerhard Siegel’s Captain, John Tomlinson’s Doctor and Endrik Wottrich’s Drum Major – register as caricatures rather than characters. Following Carrie Cracknell’s darkly brilliant production for English National Opera earlier this year, the Royal Opera’s version no longer cuts it.

Salvatore Sciarrino’s opera (1998) is based on a mid-17th century play recounting these crimes of passion, from which he fashioned his own libretto. The text is loaded with symbolism and ambiguity, yet rarely weighed down, and the gorgeous, featherlight score hardly amounts to music at all, more a vapour of sounds overheard during the action.Under conductor Michael Rafferty the breeze-borne musical chirruping, fluttering and clicking of the garden scenes –  in which the Duchess promises herself in quick succession first to the Duke and then to the Guest – transform first into echoing the characters’ quivering, nervous souls, and later into perhaps prefiguring – at length in the final Intermezzo – the Duchess’s final breaths. Michael McCarthy’s focused staging underlines that all is buried below the surface, so that the couples’ passions, the Servant’s jealousy, the Duchess’s guilty torment, the Duke’s heartbreak are lightly articulated, but unbetrayed. Placed around the action, the audience is another enclosing force, witnessing more even than the eavesdropping, lovelorn Servant.The singers semi-declaim decorative fragments, interchanging them like ancient song birds. Amanda Forbes as the Duchess combines a lithe, flowering voice while grappling with love, guilt and honour; and if William Towers is comparatively charismatic as the dishy Guest, George Humphreys’s Duke is unnerving in his highly contained passive aggression. This is a powerful realisation of a breathaking piece of music theatre.

The fact that the whole genre of French grand opera – vocally and orchestrally demanding, as well as expensive to stage – fell completely out of fashion accounts for this surprising neglect.The opera is set in Palermo in 1282, where the Sicilian populace is increasingly resentful of the occupying French forces who govern them under Guy de Montfort. The local freedom fighters are led by Duchess Helene and the fanatical Procida, but their position appears to be compromised when Henri, one of their young members, learns that he is Montfort’s son.Acclaimed Norwegian director Stefan Herheim moves the action to the period and location of the premiere – the Paris Opera – an idea that has become a directorial cliche, even though it is handled here with something approaching brilliance; the clunky concept is that the struggle between Verdi’s French and Sicilians is mirrored in one between artists and those who use and abuse art.You may get sick of the relentless ballerinas, and the final massacre is fudged, yet Herheim’s intricate direction and the stunning designs by Philipp Furhofer and Gesine Vollm maintain a genuine theatrical fascination. Ultimately, the result is a great show that emphasises the greatness of the opera itself.Though always brave, the singing is mixed, ranging from Marina Poplavskaya’s uneven Helene through Bryan Hymel’s game Henri and Michael Volle’s conscientious Montfort to Erwin Schrott’s sparky Procida. Pappano conducts with his customary perspicacity.

The depiction of an arrogant nobility run amuck and trading on its appearance to despoil all around it, has a certain contemporary political resonance.In this, Peter Kalman is a fine Leporello, creating an unlikely coalition between servant and the nobility to which he aspires. For his part, the superbly strutting Jacques Imbrailo in the title role has a voice honeyed for seduction yet harsh in its arrogance when dealing with anyone but a potential conquest.What makes this feel special, however, is in the depths of emotional complexity which Allen finds in the supporting performances. As Donna Ana, Anita Watson (deputising for the indisposed Susan Gritton) finds a character thrown into a rictus of inaction by Giovanni’s violence. Her blustering fiance Don Ottavio (Ed Lyon) never really attempts to deliver on his declared support.Lisa Milne is a standout Donna Elvira, Giovanni’s previously despoiled lover, capturing the emotional struggle between logical head and disloyal heart. Anna Devin as easily seduced peasant Zerlina and Barnaby Rea as her fiance Masetto, add fine voices and strong performances.Conductor Speranza Scappucci brings out a big, precise performance from the Orchestra of Scottish Opera. It is intricate for much of the piece, but rises to the grand complexities of the Giovanni’s seduction party.

Fiona Shaw makes her directorial debut for the company, characteristically drawing out revealing insights. Far from being removed commentators, the Male Chorus and Female Chorus roles are seamlessly integrated into the action, though existing outside it. They are a 1940s couple, dredging up and reliving the tale of the Etruscan prince Tarquinius and his desire for Lucretia as a means of making sense of Europe being ravaged in their own time.The notion of excavation is a prominent feature, with Lucretia being drawn up through the ground of an archaeological dig on her first appearance, and her house is revealed as a Roman ruin. Another twist of Shaw’s is the introduction of a daughter, who is forced to cover her ears during her mother’s rape – and who, along with all of her generation, will bear the consequences of Tarquinius’s actions.If Michael Levine’s black-earth set underlines the opera’s austerity, Nicholas Collon in the pit reflects the same in the score, though he picks out its keen colouring too, not least in the somnolent alto flute, clarinet and muted horn accompaniment to the Female Chorus’s Act II lullaby. Duncan Rock is a bold, rich-toned and physically beefy Tarquinius and if Allan Clayton sounds a touch soft-edged as the Male Chorus it’s perhaps in keeping with the nature of the role. Claudia Huckle sings Lucretia with passion and grace, while Catherine Wyn-Rogers is luxuriously cast as one of her attendants, Bianca.This may be a deeply unsettling evening but it’s a richly rewarding one too.

Premiered at the Snape Maltings as part of the 2007 Aldeburgh Festival, the veteran Japanese actor Yoshi Oida’s production, here revived by Rob Kearley, reveals its origins on a simple concert platform rather than in a fully equipped theatre in its limited technical requirements; Tom Schenk’s set, Richard Hudson’s costumes and Paule Constable’s lighting nevertheless come together to produce an atmospheric if austere vision of Venice at the beginning of the 20th century.This is an opera that depends, above all, on its two leading players. Here the lengthy, inward-looking role of the dried-up writer Gustav von Aschenbach, who seeks creative renewal in Venice yet finds instead moral and physical dissolution, is explored with considerable authority and imaginative sympathy by tenor Alan Oke. The roles of the seven characters that appear to lead Aschenbach along the road to his destruction are taken by Peter Savidge, who works hard all evening and to some purpose, even if he lacks an ideal variety of tone and character.Far more questionable is the decision to allot the role of Tadzio, with whom Aschenbach becomes increasingly obsessed, to a female dancer, Emily Mezieres, rather than more straightforwardly presenting the beautiful youth Britten, and his source, Thomas Mann, imagined. Despite this, much of the power of the piece comes over, notably through the superior quality of music-making under conductor Richard Farnes.

It’s not a vintage cast, though there are good elements, but overall the show seems to have gone fuzzy around the edges; many of the stage pictures still look wonderful – Han Feng’s vivid costumes remain a distinct plus – but only the broad outline of the direction holds the focus of attention on the central characters and the drama they enact. Carolyn Choa’s choreography – here revived by Anita Griffin – retains some visual magic, while the puppets – love them or hate them – are as before.Meanwhile, Dina Kuznetsova looks on the mature side for Butterfly, and her voice needs more warmth and richness at the top of the range. She’s partnered by Timothy Richards as an uncharismatic Pinkerton; he sings ably, but without passion or a truly Italianate quality to his tenor. George von Bergen provides a workmanlike Sharpless, the tone not always centred on the note. Best of the principals is Pamela Helen Stephen’s Suzuki, who misses nothing dramatically and shows the possibilities of a vital secondary role. Neither Alun Rhys-Jenkins’s Goro nor Alexander Robin Baker’s Yamadori makes a strong impression, though Mark Richardson’s stern Bonze is vocally fierce and forthright.Italian conductor Gianluca Marciano makes his ENO debut in the pit.

It’s one of the composer’s masterpieces – a darkly brilliant satirical comedy to a libretto by Vincenzo Grimani, a senior politician and cardinal who was also a diplomat, and who knew the world of power politics and high-level sexual liaisons inside out.His tale of plotting and counter-plotting in the world of ancient Rome would resonate in any age. It tells how the ultimate ambitious mother Agrippina – second wife of the emperor Claudius, and mother of Nero by a previous marriage – tries to ensure that her unworthy son replaces her unloved husband on the imperial throne.Designer Samal Blak provides an elegant box set with a moveable centrepiece, allowing scenes to change quickly and effectively. ETO general director James Conway’s staging – he also provides the English translation – is decent enough, though it lacks the dramatic sophistication and sharpness of detail that this complex and subtle piece deserves.Several of the individual performances nevertheless make their mark, notably Gillian Webster’s manipulative Agrippina, Jake Arditti’s spoiled brat of a Nero, and Paula Sides’ sexy Poppea. Other roles – Clint van der Linde’s Ottone, Andrew Slater’s Claudius and Luke D Williams’ Lesbo – fall relatively flat.But the score comes over strongly, given the fluent musicianship of the Old Street Band under the baton of conductor Jonathan Peter Kenny.

It was first performed in 1649 and much revived thereafter – although it has rarely been staged in modern times.The plot tells a complex tale of love, duty, honour and dishonour, although the heavily cut edition performed here leaves it feeling distinctly gappy. Most of it concerns not the celebrated stealing of the Golden Fleece – which Medea notoriously aided and abetted – but Jason’s passion for the Queen of Colchis while his former wife Isiphile, with whom he already has two children, pines away at Lemnos. No ruse is too low for him, including trying (unsuccessfully) to arrange Isiphile’s murder, but a happy ending is somehow contrived.Ted Huffman’s production, unfortunately, doesn’t always maximise characteristic elements of the tradition to which the work belongs. Michal Czerniawski seems uncomfortable with the drag role of Medea’s nurse, Delfa, and there is a general fuzziness around all but the best performances.Hannah Pedley, however, brings plenty of vocal and physical charisma to the sorceress Medea, while Catrine Kirkman manages to suggest both Isiphile’s vulnerability and her clinging quality. Andrew Slater provides a rock solid Hercules and Piotr Lempr a striking Orestes, although John-Colyn Gyeantey makes less of an impression as King Egeus, Jason’s rival for Medea’s love. Musical values are perfectly decent, with Joseph McHardy conducting the Old Street Band in the pit.

Visually it remains a distinctly mixed experience, in which the magic of the original fairytale is largely ditched: the angels in the dream pantomime sequence are just everyday kids, dressed in white and eating hamburgers; they return, grotesquely fattened up, for the opera’s close.The earlier part of the show benefits significantly from an outstanding brother-and-sister act in the two title roles. Both blessed with excellent voices, Victoria Yarovaya’s Hansel and Andriana Chuchman’s Gretel act as well as they sing; utterly convincing as children, they turn the famous Evening Prayer into something unforgettably moving.Not far behind them are Anne Mason’s tetchy Mother and Stephen Gadd’s alcohol fuelled Father; with their help the family scenes of Act 1 go perfectly. Later on Colin Judson makes a superior Witch, though his demise – when Gretel shoves him behind a pile of cornflake packets in a supermarket – is neither spectacular nor scary enough. Overall, too much of the dark fantasy of the Brothers Grimm has been replaced by a worthy tract about the perils of consumerism and overeating.Glyndebourne’s own orchestra, though, provides top quality playing, while the young Venezuelan conductor Ilyich Rivas makes every note of the score tell. But with lots of children attending this family friendly opera, this would have been a good opportunity for Glyndebourne to relax its overly rigid language policy and play the piece in English.

The darkness of the subject matter – left to his own devices by his reclusive father, teenager Frank retreats into a feral fantasy world on his remote Scottish island – is reflected in a bleak production.Nerves are set on edge from the shocking outset as the auditorium is plunged into pitch darkness to the accompaniment of 10 seconds (it feels a lot longer) of visceral electronic white noise – a plausible representation of a killer’s mind. The lights slowly rise, slightly, to reveal Mirella Weingarten’s atmospheric black-box set – a large rectangular platform covered in earth, in which the three female singers, whose disembodied voices have only been heard until now, are buried.Banks’ novel unfolds mainly in Frank’s first-person narrative; David Pountney’s libretto is an abstract precis, the amplified singers – Liselot De Wilde, Mariam Wallentin and Jordis Richter, also intense physical performers – portraying fragmentary episodes which evoke its spirit with acute effectiveness.The live musicians – a string quintet at the back of the stage – are members of the Reykjavic Sinfonia, and Frost’s haunting, electronica-infused score frequently seems to have been influenced by cerebral pop artist Bjork – also from Iceland, where Frost has lived since 2005.An enterprising and uncompromising staging of a difficult story, this tense, vividly communicated and claustrophobic production is not for the faint-hearted.

Alessandro Talevi directs – as in Anna Bolena, the opening segment – while Madeleine Boyd returns as designer.The final production in the sequence proves the best, though Boyd’s designs are once again the least appealing thing in the show. Even so, it looks more handsome than its predecessors – though the giant metal spider Queen Elizabeth I mounts at one point is bizarre. Bar some artificial chorus movement and a pointless use of the revolve, Talevi’s direction, too, is considerably sharper and more purposeful.But what makes this operatic account of the tragic ending of the relationship between Elizabeth and her unfaithful courtier Essex memorable are the vocal and musical performances. Canadian soprano Alexandra Deshorties excels as the English queen, rising with emotional grandeur and technical aplomb to an unforgettably intense final scene. As her fickle but doomed lover, Leonardo Capalbo sounds and looks like a romantic tenor dream. Leah-Marian Jones shows her mettle in a major role as Essex’s guilty lover Sara, Duchess of Nottingham, while David Kempster is nothing short of magnificent as her husband the Duke, whose discovery of his wife’s affair turns Essex’s sole remaining friend into his deadly enemy. Once again showing his credentials in Italian opera, conductor Daniele Rustioni maintains musical excitement in the pit. If you can catch just one of the three shows as they tour, this is the one to go for.

In Allen Moyer’s set and Constance Hoffman’s often spectacular metrosexual costumes, the period of Johann Strauss’s effervescent operetta has been moved forward from the late 19th century to the less stable central Europe of the 1920s. Frosch, the comic jailor of the final act – previously personified at ENO by such great but old-fashioned comedians as Frankie Howerd or Clive Dunn – is here played by German actor Jan Pohl as a militaristic policeman cracking his whip with a distinctly provocative S&M appeal.If director Christopher Alden’s programme note and his references to Freud make his production sound like an over-serious take on an essentially frivolous entertainment, that does it less than justice. The feel of the show may be Weimar Republic instead of imperial Vienna – rather like Berg’s Lulu played as an operetta – but the rackety characters and their amorous deceptions still strike a familiar chord, even if the sexual shenanigans in which they engage may be bolder and more diverse.More problematic is some of the singing. Neither Julia Sporsen’s Rosalinde nor Rhian Lois’ Adele hits home, while the conception of Prince Orlofsky as crazy is as unconvincing as Jennifer Holloway’s indifferent vocalism. The men are better, led by Tom Randle’s urbane, opportunistic Eisenstein, Richard Burkhard’s confident Falke, Edgaras Montvidas’s game and handsomely sung Alfred and Andrew Shore’s bewildered Frank. Add in Eun Sun Kim’s spirited conducting, and you have a spicy rendition of a classic too often played too safely.

Helen Sherman plays the trouser role of Nero with Stalin-like self-obsession, regarding his ruthless, power-hungry mistress Poppea (Paula Sides) as merely a sex-object.It’s a generally strong cast with some impressive voices, and the period-instrument pit ensemble (the Old Street Band) plays with spirit and stylishness. However, unfamiliarity with Monteverdi’s recitative-heavy early-Baroque syntax results in too much uncertainty, especially with the music’s frequent changes of meter and tempo. Hopefully, under conductor Michael Rosewell’s guidance, cast and musicians will gain confidence as the tour progresses.There are some moving moments, however – not least the sumptuously sung, poignant final duet for Poppea and Nero – and the drama is compellingly conveyed thanks to clear direction, committed performances and Anne Ridler’s plain English translation. It’s a longish evening, despite major pruning of the score, but doesn’t feel it – proof that this production has the potential to succeed.

The first prize-winners are librettist Ace McCarron (best known as one of the country’s leading lighting designers) and composer Guy Harries, whose new piece is based on Marina Lewycka’s novel; at the end of the run the next winners will be announced. It’s a worthy project, and if Two Caravans doesn’t hit all available targets, it does strike quite a number of them.With a Ukrainian background, but born in a refugee camp in Germany after the war, Lewycka understands the experience of the modern migrant workers in Britain she writes about in her novel. They reappear in McCarron’s well crafted libretto – individuals from Ukraine, Poland, Russia and Malawi, some purely exploited, others exploiting the rest.There is arguably too much incident for the narrative to be clear – much of it in the form of a journey across England to find a happy future. But Vincent Van Den Elshout’s direction remains clean and focused, and is delivered by the five-strong cast with incredible panache. All of them excel, vocally and dramatically, doubling and tripling up roles as required. Among them, Rosie Middleton (especially as Yola, the Polish gang boss) and Peter Brathwaite (as Emanuel, a refugee from Malawi) shine particularly brightly; one of his solos – a poignant letter to his sister – is a highlight. Too much of the remainder of the score is anodyne and rhythmically dull; but the production ensures that the piece comes over.

Visually the result is memorable, the sense of deep emotional dislocation conveyed by Edwards’ designs retaining a disturbingly powerful edge, while his direction is both economical and astute.Grandly baleful in the title role is American soprano Christine Goerke, her dramatic commitment to the tragic central figure as unstinting as her singing is bold and tireless. Michaela Schuster matches her as a Klytemnestra of raddled external dignity and inner decay. Adrianne Pieczonka brings appropriate lyricism to her portrayal of Elektra’s more conventional sister, Chrysothemis, who yearns for a normal life amidst the surrounding mayhem.Comparatively secondary to this demented trio are the menfolk in the opera. Iain Paterson nevertheless makes a good deal of Elektra’s brother Orest, whose belated arrival on the scene brings about the expiating violence his sister has longed for, while John Daszak makes a plausible victim of Klytemnestra’s effete lover, Aegisth. Smaller roles are all decently done, with Jeremy White registering strongly as the Old Servant.The alternately gruesome and glittering score caused a scandal when it was new in 1909. More than a century later, the challenge consists in conveying its sense of violence without lapsing into brutalist crudity. Conductor Andris Nelsons succeeds in keeping textures translucent, allowing Strauss’s mastery of subtle effects as well as psychological terror to shine through.

A master of historically informed performance, he brings considerable experience to the task, even if some of his tempos register as a touch inflexible for the singers; the recitatives, meanwhile, occasionally seem a bit laboured.Flow improves, nevertheless, throughout the evening, making this revival of Sir David McVicar’s 2006 staging a rewarding one. McVicar’s inimitable hand is evident in innumerable small details created for this particular cast, while the broader insights in his minor updating from the eighteenth century to 1830 are once more astutely observed. Tanya McCallin’s subtly coloured sets retain their charm and atmospheric appositeness. The posse of ever watchful servants is good fun. There are many new faces on stage at this revival, led by the straightforward and utterly human Figaro of Italian bass-baritone Luca Pisaroni, as handsome physically as he is vocally; he’s ably partnered by Lucy Crowe’s slightly earnest Susanna. The upper-class couple is finely represented by Christopher Maltman’s volatile Count Almaviva and Maria Bengtsson’s Countess – the latter subtly sung if a touch on the small side. Renata Pokupic is a winsome if rather girly Cherubino. Secondary roles, such as Helene Schneiderman’s gamey Marcellina, Carlos Chausson’s dyspeptic Bartolo and Lynton Black’s treasurable Antonio, are all well served, though Jean-Paul Fouchecourt’s Don Basilio veers a little too far in the direction of the camp stereotype. Mary Bevan makes a memorable Barbarina.

The centrepiece of the opera is a famous scene in which the two queens come face to face for a vocal battle royal – though in real life they never actually met.Unfortunately, Austrian director Rudolf Frey’s, production – designed, like the other two operas in the trilogy, by Madeleine Boyd – is about as unhelpful as they come. Individual performances register poorly from a dramatic point of view, especially Adina Nitescu’s Elizabeth and Judith Howarth’s Mary, neither of whom is granted any dignity, let alone regality. The men are unconvincingly portrayed, with too many moments combining the vacuous with the portentous or the ludicrous. Add in the gloom and ugliness of Boyd’s designs – essentially rearranged from those she provided for Anna Bolena a week earlier – and this Tudor Trilogy, which looked so promising on paper, is turning out be a serious disappointment.Musically and vocally there’s some pleasure to be had. Judith Howarth manages some fine vocalism as Mary, if not quite consistently so, and Nitescu is a presentable Elizabeth. Solidly respectable singing from Alastair Miles’s Talbot, Garry Griffith’s Cecil and Bruce Sledge’s Leicester, and effective conducting from Graeme Jenkins; but they’re all struggling against a misguided staging.

Psychologically crude, it remains undeniably effective with Sally Jacobs’ fantastical oriental designs, F Mitchell Dana’s dramatic lighting and Kate Flatt’s choreography a big part of the appeal. Its single set is a pagoda-like tiered pavilion from which the chorus watches us watching it. The masks and movement have not dated.The present polyglot cast is less strong. Making her Covent Garden debut in the central role of the heartless princess, one she has sung all over the world, American soprano Lise Lindstrom is more focused and less sheerly loud than many exponents. She is even plausible as a love object. Neurotic and isolated at the start she makes a decent fist of melting by the end, a transformation which the music itself (left unfinished by Puccini) has trouble validating. As incarnated by Marco Berti, her suitor Calaf is sturdy rather than stylish. His main asset is a ringing Italian timbre; his acting is stiff. The subtlest performer on stage is Eri Nakamura, a suitably fragile, tragic Liu. The voice itself is vibrant and warm.Turandot will not be a make or break assignment for the thirtysomething Hungarian conductor Henrik Nanasi, once Antonio Pappano’s assistant and already music director of the Komische Oper Berlin. In his own house debut he set a cracking pace for ‘In questa reggia’ perhaps intending to assist his star who took a while to settle. There had been some less than taut choral singing earlier.The opera is revisited in February with a different cast under the baton of Nicola Luisotti.

All three productions are designed by Madeleine Boyd, while Alessandro Talevi stages two of them.Their first assignment is the work that launched Donizetti’s international career in 1830 and is generally reckoned his first masterpiece. Anna Bolena tells how Henry VIII divorces his second wife and has her executed on trumped-up charges, while her former maid-of-honour Jane Seymour is moved into position as his third.Sadly, and despite perceptive moments in Talevi’s direction, the show’s visuals are distinctly weak. Colour is virtually absent from the black-on-black sets until Anna’s final mad scene, when she is belatedly allowed a glamorous red gown; elsewhere the women’s costumes are seriously unflattering. Odd that one of the most dramatic periods in English history should be presented as drab. Some of the chorus movement, too, and a haphazard use of the revolve, impede the dramatic flow.Musically, things are better, though the lively young Italian conductor Daniele Rustioni doesn’t really get into his stride until after the interval. Memorable are Katharine Goeldner’s Jane Seymour, who effectively steals the great second-act duet from Serena Farnocchia’s Anna, although the latter rises impressively to the challenge of the final scene. Meanwhile, Robert McPherson sings a sweet but slender-toned Percy and Faith Sherman is an effective Smeton, while Alastair Miles’s Henry is more solid dramatically than vocally.

It is not just a minor update to the backdrop, but a major alteration which, while making Lulu African-American, allows the opera to be as much about race as it is about gender.The change is further emphasised by Neuwirth’s introduction of notable speeches about emancipation by Martin Luther King and poems by June Jordan. This reflects Lulu’s background, growing up in the racist southern states in the 1950s.Angel Blue makes a hard-nosed yet sensual Lulu. Instead of being presented as a snake in the opening scene, she stands on a pedestal between the on-stage orchestra and the audience. She is separated from both by the glittering bars of gold shimmer curtain.A successful New York prostitute, she is asked to justify her insatiability, considering her wealth. In response she tells her life story, revealing details of her relationships with the white (mostly) men who, in loving her, thought they could own her.Neuwirth slips elements of jazz and blues into her heavy edit of Berg’s harsh vocal score. But in contrast the Wonder Morton theatre organ, which is used in recording to create some elements of the original, sounds soft and malleable.The opera’s resetting is a fascinating way of reviving the confrontational element of Frank Wedekind’s plays, on which Berg’s original was based. These plays were purposefully confrontational for their audiences – in a way that they would not be today. Bringing race into the picture successfully reinstates that element of confrontation with the subject matter. Magda Willi’s design reinforces this, by caging Lulu on stage for most of the time, her dressing room visible in the wings and hemmed in by the orchestra, ranged out like a big band, at the back of the steeply stepped stage.Yet great ideas and schemes do not necessarily make great opera. It feels like a long 110 minutes. The music is unforgiving to its listener. Blue might be astounding to listen to, but what she sings is relentless.She, at least, is allowed by director John Fulljames to develop some depth of character. Around her are caricatures. Paul Curievici’s Photographer, who marries her and makes his fortune from selling images of her, is a succession of poses.Dr Bloom, her protector who saved her from a worse fate when he began his affair with her when she was 12, fares a bit better. Donald Maxwell conveys the complexities in Bloom’s relationship with Lulu, but there is much more which is told than there is shown. Only Jacqui Dankworth – as Lulu’s lover the blues singer Eleanor – really finds any depth as her relationship with Lulu is never explicitly portrayed.A strongly performed production with the Orchestra of Scottish Opera in fine form under the precise control of Gerry Cornelius. But while it is one thing to be deliberately alienating for effect, the material does nothing to endear its audience.

Any action takes place on this bench – various tableaux of happy courtiers around Paula Murrihy’s capricious Dido, the machinations of the vile witches against serene Dido and her final Lament, sung alone with huge power and understanding, with the chorus are sent off to the orchestra pit.Period instruments give a somewhat lush interpretation of Purcell’s score under conductor Constantinos Carydis. The softness of the timbre is in complete contrast to the austerity of the staging. But memorably, they dwindle away to nothing as the orchestra follow the chorus and principals out of the theatre during the final bars. Leaving Dido to die alone, the final note of the whole piece unfinished.Director Barrie Kosky inverts the claustrophobia of the Purcell with a wide open Bluebeard’s Castle. All stage scenery is removed, leaving just a huge white revolve for Robert Hayward’s torturing Bluebeard and Tanja Ariane Baumgartner’s self-victimising Judith.The seven doors are represented through various elements of powder, water and costume with formally black-clad extras. It is a constantly challenging direction, which finds Judith as Bluebeard’s equal in many ways. And there on her own volition. Musically, the slope of the revolve constantly alters the dynamic and balance between orchestra and singers, underlining that Bluebeard and Judith are totally at the mercy of their surroundings, his castle.

Well, seriously impressive is the answer. Gary Hill’s immense hologram visuals fill the stage, projecting Mandelbrot galaxies that eerily spiral to the beat, multi-levelled galleries that plunge us dizzily into their depths. Taking inspiration from Ridley Scott’s Prometheus via the classic sci-fi of Tron and Metropolis, scene and theme are set with convincing boldness, a concept rather less matched by Paulina Wallenberg-Olsson’s costumes, similarly bold but more out of the Red Dwarf camp.While this immensity does not eclipse intimacy – Florestan’s lament in his cell is supremely focused – it imposes a pervading woodenness on the protagonists even when zipping around on low-cut Segways, their natural space for movement reduced to a linear rat-run in between theprojections.Kazushi Ono exacts a light touch with the Opera de Lyon orchestra from Beethoven’s often chugging score, though the strings are tinny and dramatic build-up is rare. Indeed, union objections aside, one rather imagines the impact of a full-blooded electronic version of the score to match those visuals. In the performer department, aside from Michael Eder’s powerful Rocco, none of the voices stand out – a shame given their sensitive interpretations – while the choruses are shrill.The only pieces that lift are Mir ist so wunderbar, the quartet featuring Rocco, Marzelline (Valentina Nafornita), Leonore (Erika Sunnegardh) and Jaquino (Christian Baumgartel), and Florestan’s (Nikolai Schukoff) poignant Gott! Welch Dunkel hier! wrung from the depths of his incarceration. The latter in particular helps underpin the universality of Fidelio’s vision of human dignity versus the Machine, something we can all relate to in this inventive update to a futuristic world not so dissimilar from our own.Read reviews of Edinburgh Fringe reviews

His attraction to the handsome and innocent new recruit Billy Budd is barely articulated in the text, and yet in this performance we sense it’s the chink in Claggart’s armour that is the key to a deep self-loathing. Budd’s relationship to Captain Vere is also brilliantly drawn, a consummation based on mutual loyalty and understanding.Andrew Davis, Glyndebourne’s music director throughout the 1990s, captures the crew’s exuberant sea-shanties and its testosterone-fuelled anticipation of engaging with the enemy ship, as well as Billy’s somnolent dream music and the stark yet inscrutable series of 34 chords intoned by the orchestra while Vere, offstage, informs Budd of his death sentence.The singing is uniformly first-rate. Jacques Imbrailo, as Budd, strikes a fine balance between naivety and self-confidence, and Mark Padmore’s smooth-toned Vere matches the character of an idealistic intellectual tormented by having administered the rule of law against his own beliefs.This stunningly powerful production must surely be a high point of this year’s Britten centenary celebrations.

Still the antithesis of dinner-jacketed pretension, the two-week annual opera festival now exudes a confident, fringe-style identity of its own, with something to suit every taste and potential treats for anyone willing to explore the unknown.Now in its 7th year, Grimeborn’s line-up is more diverse than ever, from innovative pared-down productions of mainstream classics – Handel, Mozart, even Debussy’s Pelleas et Melisande – to weird and wonderful experimental or neglected works. Most of the artists are young up-comers, some more established than others.Formed last year, Eboracum Baroque is a group of early-music students or recent graduates – many with connections to York University – so it is not too surprising that this black-dress, no-set version of Purcell’s one-act masterpiece feels like a student production.On those terms, however, there is much that impresses – especially the enthusiastic, well-drilled chorus that relishes the diverse roles of restrained courtiers, hissing witches and boozy sailors. Conductor Chris Parsons imparts assured musical integrity to cast and band (string quartet and harpsichord) but, despite lively chorus choreography, his stage direction lacks definition – the title roles seem like peripheral characters.It’s a promising debut, but the greatest accolade due the young artists is their superhuman ability to perform so well in the unbearably oppressive airlessness of the low-ceiling cellar that is Arcola’s Studio 2 – a venue unfit for public performance of this kind.

Mixing verismo-style realism (reflected partly in Rafaele’s connection to the camorristi, the Neapolitan equivalent of the mafia) with Gennaro’s sacrilegious act of stealing the jewels from a statue of the Madonna in a bid to win the affections of the profligate Maliella, it here receives its first professional London run since 1926.But the novelty value is only part of the story in Martin Lloyd-Evans’s illuminating production. Evans and conductor Peter Robinson create a propulsive flow across the entire first act, with its giddying merry-go-round of crowd scenes, fuelled by a large, full-blooded chorus. Lloyd’s impressive crowd management is also clear in the last act, a night of debauched partying at the camorrists’ club, and he’s brave enough to juxtapose a beating-up outside the club with the act’s stirringly lyrical Intermezzo.Welsh soprano Natalya Romaniw makes a distinguished company debut as Maliella, whose feisty, libertine spirit turns out to mask a core of naivety – she combines convincing seductive charms with dramatic vocal heft. Opera Holland Park veteran Olafur Sigurdarson may not look the part of Maliella’s would-be lover Rafaele, and there’s a slight harshness to his singing, but he certainly acts the part. Gennaro, the initially more dependable rival for Maliella’s affections, is sung by Joel Montero, with notable warmth. The expanded City of London Sinfonia not only makes a huge sound but plays with vivid colouring. All round, this could be one of the operatic highlights of the year.

To a libretto by Maggie Gottlieb, Will Todd’s Alice opera is loosely based on Lewis Carroll’s hardy perennial of children’s literature rather than being a straightforward transfer of book into opera; but enough of the iconic characters and events are here for audience members to get a handle on what is happening.They do so out of doors in this alfresco staging on the Yucca Lawn behind the theatre in the park where the main stage opera programme plays. Each scene in Leslie Travers’ easy-on-the-eye designs is set up in a different corner, with the audience moving around in between, shepherded on their way by members of the cast. The result is easy to follow in both senses.In Gottlieb’s version, Alice is a contemporary girl from Grimthorpe whose eventful adventures begin and end in a pet shop where she has a strange conversation with the White Rabbit. Then her dream (or is it a dream?) begins, and Carroll’s creations pop up and sing before us. Famous episodes such as the Mad Hatter’s Tea Party and meetings with the Caterpillar, Humpty Dumpty and both Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee all evoke familiar territory. The show climaxes in a reappearance of Robert Burt’s properly terrifying Red Queen, whose Off With Their Heads! number provides one of several moments that arouse spontaneous applause. Martin Duncan’s simple staging is admirably clear, and a surprisingly high ratio of the text comes over from a cast that is obviously determined to be audible.Todd’s music will present no problems to audiences of whatever level of sophistication. Perhaps best known for his anthem The Call of Wisdom, which was sung at the Queen’s jubilee service in St Paul’s Cathedral last year, 43-year-old Todd is a versatile composer whose stage works in various genres always possess immediacy and dramatic grasp. Although this particular work spends more of its musical time in the area of Shaftesbury Avenue than it does in Covent Garden, the resulting all-sung blend of jazzy rhythms, musical and even vaudeville makes light work of Carroll and his creations. Stuart Stratford conducts an ensemble of 11 players, who move around the open air venue just like the other performers and the audience.Opera Holland Park has gone for a high-quality cast, several of them regulars at this venue in full-scale operatic productions. Both charming and knowing as Alice, Fflur Wyn leads the team appealingly and skilfully. Burt steals his scenes as an alarming Red Queen but without actually scaring the kids away. James Cleverton is the benign White Rabbit, Keel Watson the vocally and physically grand Caterpillar and John Lofthouse a touchingly lugubrious White Knight, while Clare Hendrick and Elaine Tate make an unusually noticeable pair as Tweedles Dum and Dee respectively.

The French director’s take on the piece is nothing if not unusual, despite many traditional elements. The costumes are period, though of an even earlier time than that of the work’s Parisian premiere (1843), when it was played in contemporary dress – thus offering a perhaps unique instance of a director pushing the period not forwards, but back.Julia Hansen’s delightful designs frequently feature a revolve, allowing us to witness the different characters in different rooms – or even houses – at more or less the same moment. The results are witty and informative, and the sudden appearance on one turn of the wheel of the entire Glyndebourne Chorus in full 18th century costume is a genuine coup de theatre. Clement’s idea that Malatesta and Norina are actually engaged in some sort of affair is perhaps just plain wrong, but it is so cleverly sketched in that its extra layer of intrigue fascinates.The cast is of vintage quality. Danielle de Niese offers effortless command of the stage and high-flying vocalism as a tricksy Norina. Enea Scala’s Ernesto combines vital tenor singing with a lazy charm as Pasquale’s wayward nephew. The distinguished Italian buffo specialist Alessandro Corbelli is quite simply the most human protagonist one will ever see or hear – sad and funny simultaneously. More mystifying in his motivation than usual, the manipulative Malatesta comes over as darkly elegant in Nikolay Borchev’s sinister interpretation. Conductor Enrique Mazzola bounces the score along. The overall result is Glyndebourne at its best.

Pia Furtado’s new production sets the action in an industrial greenhouse on a large-scale sunflower farm. The owner Adina’s image looms from a pair of delivery vans either side of the stage. In the 30-degree heat and under the canopy of Holland Park Theatre, it’s almost as if the auditorium becomes one with the stage.The potion-peddling quack, Dr Dulcama, has a presence from the start, furtively siphoning off whatever stray liquids he can to bottle up as his ‘remedies’. Sung by Geoffrey Dolton, it’s a novel characterisation, far removed from the standard slick-salesman stereotype – no-one is more surprised than Dulcamara that he finds credibility with the locals, and you wouldn’t know that Dolton joined the production only two weeks ago, owing to the original Dulcamara’s withdrawal through illness.Much of the success of this production revolves around Sarah Tynan’s Adina, a distinguished performance with layers of expressive range and vocal shading – and she grows in dignity after admitting her love for Nemorino. Aldo di Toro’s Nemorino is a good complement. Just occasionally his lyricism needs more space but the lithe Italianate colouring is there, and he is convincing as the apparently dull-brained worker who ultimately becomes one of the first to recognise Dulcamara’s charlatanism. George von Bergen is entertaining as the blustery sergeant Belcore, Nemorino’s rival for Adina’s affectations, though his soldiers’ movements are a touch ragged.Making his OHP debut, conductor Steven Higgins is highly effective if lacking in spontaneity. For its bright, sunflowery look, though, and its impressive leading couple, this Elixir is quite a tonic.

Clarke’s Franglais translation is also a plus, and snappily delivered by the cast, with the two young Parisian rakes – Anthony Flaum’s Gardefeu and Oliver White’s Bobinet – both superbly entertaining. Once or twice accents – French or Swedish mainly – come adrift, but the sense of surreal hilarity is maintained throughout.Musical values, too, are high. Geoffrey Paterson leads a precise and spirited account of the score, with strong singing from all the principals and peppy playing from the Chroma Chamber Ensemble. Thibault Perrine’s reduced version of the score has been expertly done.The company work their socks off, many of them doubling and tripling roles of whatever sex to get us through the absurdist complexities of Offenbach’s crazy day in the tempting world of Parisian vice. Philip Cox’s Baron Gondremark loses his dignity more times than a House of Commons full of MPs. It’s a delightful show by a company that is fast approaching national treasure status.

Not originally intended to be dramatically realised, Britten’s pieces are performed with distinction by such leading singers as Ian Bostridge, Iestyn Davies and Benedict Nelson, with Julius Drake the immaculate pianist, Richard Watkins the fine horn player in Still Falls the Rain and Sally Pryce the excellent harpist in The Death of St Narcissus. The stagings mostly complement the musical performances rather than dramatising them – though Constable co-opts the vocalists to present Eliot’s three wise men as weary travellers with suitcases.Bartlett’s touching visualisation of My Beloved is Mine as a domestic scene in which a gay couple breakfast together makes a memorable start, but each of the five pieces is sensitively and imaginatively enacted.The result is a uniquely intimate tribute to Britten in his centenary year.

Designed by Ezio Frigerio and Franca Squarciapino, its belle epoque sets and costumes once again look marvellous. So does Angela Gheorghiu, returning to the staging she starred in when it was new in 2002. She sings the title role of Magda, the mature kept woman who briefly seeks true love with a young man but then finally leaves him – like a swallow migrating for the winter and then returning home. Dramatically the part still suits her well, though this time around her voice sounds diminished, especially in the lower register.She’s finely partnered by the fresh-faced ingenu of Charles Castronovo’s Ruggero, whose discrete and charming manner is just right. So is Edgaras Montvidas’ immaculate vocal and physical exploration of the sophisticated society wit Prunier. Partnering him is Spanish soprano Sabina Puertolas as Magda’s maid, Lisette, who finds the ideal tone for the irrepressible character. As Magda’s wealthy protector Rambaldo, Pietro Spagnoli suggests gravitas and considerable patience when she ends their relationship – temporarily, as it turns out.Despite a score that is genuinely alluring in its subtle use of harmonic and orchestral colour, La Rondine remains the most neglected of Puccini’s mature works, perhaps because the third act does not quite clinch the deal in the way one expects of this master of operatic construction. Some reservations about Gheorghiu’s vocal condition apart, this proves a worthwhile revival – though a more dynamic conductor than Marco Armiliato would give it an additional shot in the arm.

Director Jonathan Kent and designer Paul Brown – who gave Glyndebourne a major hit with Purcell’s The Fairy Queen in 2009 – return to tackle this project, as does Baroque specialist conductor William Christie and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment.Little known to UK audiences, Hippolyte et Aricie was premiered in 1733, when its novice opera composer was already 50; he would go on to produce a string of scores for Parisian audiences that remained in the French repertory up to the Revolution. Based on Racine’s classical tragedy Phedre, the plot describes how Theseus’s second wife falls in love with her stepson, Hippolytus; he, meanwhile, is in love with Aricia, a chaste follower of the goddess Diana. Phaedra cannot control her passion, and when Theseus returns home to discover his son apparently attacking his wife the scene is set for a tragedy on a grand scale. Eventually, and against all the odds, Hippolytus and Aricia are allowed to unite. Phaedra, meanwhile, kills herself from grief and guilt.Unlike in The Fairy Queen – admittedly a much lighter entertainment – where their touch was so sure, on this occasion Kent and Brown cannot seem to decide how seriously to treat their material. The substantial prologue – in which the gods Diana and Cupid quarrel over their respective power over mortals – is set in, of all things, a fridge, with Cupid bursting out of an egg. Yet despite such flippant gestures much of the action is skilfully directed, even if the opera’s final rejoicing over Diana’s bringing together of Hippolytus and Aricia is shadowed by being placed in a morgue, where the dead Phaedra returns to watch proceedings and poor Cupid has apparently been hung. On their own witty terms, Brown’s designs show consistent visual inventiveness, while Ashley Page’s choreography for the extensive dance sequences is playful; but the show is frequently off-message and the opera fails to make its full potential impact, notwithstanding Christie’s expert sense of style, the refined orchestral playing and some strong performances in the main roles.Of these, Sarah Connolly’s Phaedra leads the field. Following her Medea for English National Opera in February, the mezzo discovers another full-bodied star part to sink her teeth into, seizing and holding the audience’s sympathetic attention throughout Phaedra’s long and painful emotional journey. Christiane Karg’s Aricia and Ed Lyon’s Hippolytus convincingly represent the innocent young lovers held apart by powerful forces beyond their control. Stephane Degout is the permanently troubled Theseus, while divine intervention comes in the elegant shapes of Katherine Watson’s radiant Diana and Ana Quintans’s lyrical Cupid.

The staging looks its age, and some previous revivals have achieved a higher level of dramatic cogency – here some of the individual performances need altogether more conviction, and at times there’s a sense of routine.Matters improve over the course of the evening, fortunately, with an increased sense of momentum from the pit, where Antonio Pappano presides over a never less than solid musical performance.It’s not quite enough for this taxing opera, however. Ferruccio Furlanetto is the weighty Fiesco, pouring out rich Italianate tone all night, but the implacable hatred the character bears for Boccanegra need more vivid expression. As the Doge himself, Thomas Hampson proves a relative lightweight in a heavyweight role, sometimes untidy in his charting of Verdi’s vocal line. The lack of a true core of baritonal iron to his tone is not compensated by acting that is demonstrative rather than gripping.There’s some fine singing from Russian soprano Hibla Gerzmava, though her voice never quite blossoms at the top as it should. She’s a decent enough actress. Most striking of the principals is the American tenor Russell Thomas, in his Royal Opera debut, who rises to considerable heights in his second-act aria, while the most consistent is the Greek baritone Dimitri Platanias as the villainous Paolo, who never loses connection with the character he is playing and sings with granite-like determination. But overall it’s an uneven evening, rarely rising to the heights demanded by one of Verdi’s greatest creations.

It certainly entertains, thanks partly to the score’s abundance of appealing folk-like melodies, but there is depth and darkness too – and Humperdinck’s deft blend of sophistication and grandeur ensures there is plenty for both connoisseurs and newcomers to appreciate.That is especially true in this engaging new Garsington production by Olivia Fuchs, designed by Niki Turner. The tone is just right, Fuchs maintaining a sense of childlike wonder as well as presenting some neat touches of her own. Reflecting the story’s origins, the action takes place mainly on a vast book of Grimms’ Fairy Tales – the children’s house and, later, the gingerbread house rising from the open pages, with giant cupcakes and sweets spread around the stage.A strong cast is led by rising talents Claudia Huckle and Anna Devin, whose relative youth aids believable portrayals of Hansel and Gretel. Devin’s silvery soprano is especially delightful. Susan Bickley’s magnificent witch oozes evil deliciously, all fluffy marigold-wearing persona and pink rinse hair-do.The magical score is well served by the chamber-sized Garsington orchestra and conductor Martin Andre’s well-paced direction, helped by the acoustic of the splendid Wormsley pavilion, clearer than many opera houses. Chill drafts penetrate the heating on inclement summer evenings, but on opening night a perfectly timed thunderstorm gave marvellous atmospheric enhancement to Hansel and Gretel’s forest foray.An energetic chorus of children from Old Palace School and Trinity Boys Choir provides an upbeat and touching conclusion to an overwhelmingly joyous experience.

In the interim, and despite successful productions by English National Opera and especially Opera North, Gloriana has failed to shake off the muted reception it received back in 1953 from a first-night audience consisting largely of courtiers and diplomats.Richard Jones’ staging, which opened in Hamburg in March, makes partial amends. Together with Ultz’s designs, the director turns the show into a pageant presented before the young Elizabeth II as a kind of village-hall homage. It begins with a parade of monarchs, going backwards in time until we reach the Tudor period. The opera proper is then played as if by a fully professional company, though with stage-crew and staff recognisably amateur and of the early 1950s. The current queen makes brief appearances at the very beginning and the end. The framing device, though, undoubtedly keeps the audience at a distance from what is a real drama about power and the conflicts of love and monarchical duty. It’s visually clever, though difficult to engage with.Some of the performances strike home nevertheless, especially Toby Spence’s Essex, a real return to vocal form as well as an in-depth study of the charming, ruthlessly ambitious young man who has set Elizabeth’s heart aflutter. Susan Bullock’s queen starts less certainly but rises, as does the production as a whole, to real expressive power. Paul Daniel conducts with skill though not enough electricity.Gloriana at the Royal Opera House.

This is Warner’s most impressive opera production, sensitive to the beauty and mystery of the Venetian setting in Tom Pye’s suggestive sets and Chloe Obolensky’s immaculate period costumes – all subtly lit by Jean Kalman; as well as in the fine individual performances and the movement of ENO’s exceptional chorus.Kim Brandstrup’s choreography, too, is memorable in itself as well as neatly aligned with the overall trajectory of the show. In Britten’s opera, Tadzio, his family and his friend Jaschiu are all played by silent dancers. Sam Zaldivar represents the Polish youth with whom Aschenbach falls in love with grace and energy, in a near perfect encapsulation of the part.Aschenbach is a role to which John Graham-Hall brings a sureness of dramatic understanding and developed acting skills that allow his interpretation to be listed among those of the work’s finest exponents thus far. Andrew Shore, too, singing the seven ambiguous or enigmatic characters who lead Aschenbach steadily towards his death, individualises and makes each one memorable. Tim Mead’s Voice of Apollo is beautifully vocalised – though, here, some help for the audience in understanding the words would have been useful, surtitles not being used in this production.In the pit, ENO’s music director Edward Gardner delivers a perceptive reading of the score that highlights its infinite delicacy as well as maintaining a flawless sense of momentum. With this superb realisation ENO’s season ends on a high note.

Few will have been as imaginative as this open-air production of his first major opera in the town where he lived for most of his life and where he founded the Aldeburgh Festival in 1948, three years after Peter Grimes brought him international fame.Directed by Tim Albery, designed by Leslie Travers and conducted by Britten’s long-time associate Steuart Bedford, Grimes on the Beach has been long in the planning and surely succeeded in its grand aims on opening night. The wind was up on Aldeburgh Beach, but the rain held off, and the sea and sky provided a powerfully evocative backdrop to a mighty performance of this tragic, locally based masterpiece.Staged on a substantial platform filled with fishing boats and peopled by the members of the hostile community that harries Grimes to his death, the drama makes a huge impact. So does the vital singing of the large chorus and the playing of the Britten-Pears Orchestra – the one element pre-recorded for the otherwise live production. Alan Oke portrays a disturbed Grimes, unable to connect positively to his fellow villagers. Giselle Allen conveys the warmth of Ellen Orford, the local schoolteacher who is Grimes’ sole friend. David Kempster suggests the wary wisdom of Captain Balstrode, the most dispassionate of the Borough’s inhabitants. During the evening the emotional temperature rises to a terrifying climax, offering an unforgettable experience for those lucky enough to be present.

It’s not quite as sharp or funny as before – the tone has lost the neat balance between comedy and seriousness that Grandage achieved – but it remains a superbly good-looking show in Christopher Oram’s glamorous designs. His elegant and atmospheric Moorish-Spanish sets are some of the most visually appealing Glyndebourne has recently offered, and in his witty and apposite costumes the characters play out their roles in a clever 1960s update of the original 18th-century setting. Narrative values are high, down to the tiniest details of this busily plotted comedy.The cast is good without effacing memories of the generally superior original team. A delicious Susanna last time around, Lydia Teuscher here moves to Cherubino, offering a game, likable performance. Her replacement as a pragmatic Susanna is Laura Tatulescu, who always seems in charge of proceedings but is a little cool. Adam Plachetka’s Figaro is warm and engaging rather than the dominating presence needed. Joshua Hopkins, however, is as prepossessing as last year’s Count, entering fully into the potential of the sexually rapacious, constantly frustrated nobleman. Amanda Majeski is a tall and elegant Countess, a little distanced dramatically from her beautifully sung performance. Among the smaller roles, Timothy Robinson’s reptilian Basilio and Anne Mason’s full-on Marcellina stand out. Jeremie Rhorer draws sleek music-making from the London Philharmonic, though some of the fizz has undoubtedly gone out of the champagne.

Premiered in Luxembourg in 2006, his final opera receives its first full UK staging by WNO, a recreation of the original, designed by Jean Kalman and Robby Duiveman and thoughtfully directed by Pierre Audi.The subject coincides neatly with this year’s Wagner bicentenary. The German composer died of a heart attack in Venice in 1883, supposedly following a row with his wife Cosima about his interest in a young singer called Carrie Pringle. Meanwhile, he was still pondering writing an opera concerning the Buddha, for which he had earlier written a brief synopsis; its crucial event would have been the unprecedented admission of a woman to the Buddha’s religious order.In Harvey’s work, to a libretto by Jean-Claude Carriere, these two elements mingle. As Wagner is first struck by his heart attack, he begins to dream the opera he never wrote, eventually dying when it comes to its end. Harvey’s score pays light homage to Wagner’s music, but is characteristically his own blend of vivid and subtle orchestral colouring and enriched harmony, all topped off with a dramatically purposive lyricism and some atmospheric electronics. It registers powerfully in this imaginative staging, with the teams of actors playing Wagner and his circle and of singers recreating the Buddhist legend both excellent, while the piece itself registers as one of the finest of recent British operas.

In Stephen Barlow’s hard-hitting stagings, and with conductor Stuart Stratford securing musical performances any opera company would be proud of, the results make an exciting evening of music theatre at its best.In Yannis Thavoris’s adaptable orange-box set and 1950s costumes, Barlow presents a close and traditional Sicilian community in Cavalleria. Gweneth-Ann Jeffers pours out rich tone as the betrayed Santuzza, whose revenge on Peter Auty’s two-timing soldier-boy lover Turiddu is swift and terrible. Wielding the knife is Stephen Gadd’s authoritative Alfio, a three-dimensional portrait voiced in a firm, dark baritone. Hannah Pedley’s sexy Lola and Sarah Pring’s permanently fraught Mamma Lucia complete a cast that is visually convincing and vocally authentic.Auty and Gadd reappear in Pagliacci, doubling their workload but holding firm under the pressure involved. Auty brings terrifying intensity to Canio, the leader of a group of travelling performers who discovers his wife Nedda with her lover, while Gadd is once again excellent as Tonio, the clown whose advances Nedda mockingly rejects. Julia Sporsen, meanwhile, makes an in-depth exploration of Nedda’s hopes and frustrations, while Korean baritone Chang-Han Lim is persuasive as her young lover, Silvio. Both shows grip from start to finish, with the final minutes of Pagliacci keeping the audience right on the edge of their seats.

526,The Perfect American review at Coliseum London,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2013/the-perfect-american-review-at-coliseum-london/,The Perfect American,Coliseum London,The Perfect American review at Coliseum London,,2013-06-03,George Hall,"Jointly commissioned by ENO and the Teatro Real in Madrid, Philip Glass’ 24th opera arrives in the UK following its premiere in Spain in January. ENO has a solid track record with the 76-year-old American minimalist’s scores, having presented Akhnaten back in 1985, The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 in 1988, and Satyagraha – a particular success – in 2007.Like the latter piece, whose subject was Gandhi, The Perfect American considers an important 20th-century figure – in this case that icon of American popular culture, Walt Disney. As with Satyagraha, ENO’s production is in the imaginative hands of Phelim McDermott of Improbable, with unusually apposite video designs by Leo Warner and animation direction by Joseph Pierce, both of 59 Productions; other regular Improbable collaborators Dan Potra (sets and costumes) and Ben Wright (choreography) are also on board. Visually, the result is a fully integrated show that cleverly manages to suggest iconic elements of Disney imagery without actually quoting them.Rudy Wurlitzer’s libretto is based on Peter Stephan Jungk’s book The Perfect American, a factional fantasy based around Walt Disney’s life and more specifically his death from lung cancer in 1966. As transcribed into the opera, Disney’s illness causes him to review his life and career as he ponders his staunchly conservative all-American attitudes, his relationships, and his legacy. Interrupting his distinctly limited capacity for self-criticism is the invented figure of William Dantine, who represents one of the many unnamed artists for whose work Disney himself took all the credit. Having been sacked by Disney for trying to organise a union, and now leading a campaign to gain some recognition for his creativity, Dantine makes no dent in Disney’s views; instead, Walt focuses on his idealised background in the small-town backwater of Marceline, Missouri, where he grew up.While the overall concept is potentially fascinating, too much of the piece feels one-dimensional, with little in the way of complexity or nuance. That’s less true – perhaps surprisingly – of the score, though its advance over Glass’ previous works is unlikely to be so significant as to persuade his many detractors to seriously reconsider their positions; but it’s fair to say that there’s a richer use of harmony and colour. Conductor Gareth Jones presides over a neat musical interpretation.Individual performances are consistently good. In the title role, Christopher Purves does everything possible to humanise a character drawn with cartoon-like obviousness. Donald Kaasch struggles with the even less rounded portrayal of Dantine. David Soar as Disney’s brother Roy, Janis Kelly as his personal nurse Hazel George, and Pamela Helen Stephen as his wife Lillian all make the most of their material.A handful of scenes register positively. In one, Disney confronts a malfunctioning animatronic robot of Abraham Lincoln, wittily played by Zachary James; while deferring to Lincoln’s greatness, Disney disagrees with just about everything the historic President ever said or did. As personified by John Easterlin, Andy Warhol’s cameo appearance is wonderfully sharp. Most resonant of all are the moments when Disney draws close to young fellow-cancer-sufferer Josh, beautifully realised by Rosie Lomas. In these tangential episodes, both libretto and score achieve a warmth and engagement that stand out from an uneven operatic achievement.

He left Salty Sue, landlady of the The Blasted Bilge Rat, and their baby daughter Pegatty six months ago to go fishing but hasn’t returned… This is the world premiere of Captain Blood’s Revenge, an hour-long family-pitched ‘pirate opera’. Billy eventually reappears to tell his mysterious tale, but first we meet motherly Sue, cheery sailor Raggy Sam and a suspicious menacing mariner with a knife in his back.We are also introduced to the ‘Scum of the High Seas’ – conductor Lee Reynolds and his crack four-piece band, including nautically tangy accordion, who contribute hugely to the production’s success.Lynne Plowman’s lively and sophisticated score evokes a sea-faring mood without cliche (there are no heave-ho shanties), using minimal instrumental forces effectively. With a witty libretto that never patronises by Martin Riley, the opera achieves a fun swashbuckling atmosphere avoiding mindless pantomime antics.There’s some delightful audience interaction in the opening scenes – children are invited to conduct the band, rock the baby and dance a jig – and the characters are colourfully portrayed (although it’s a shame that the most charismatic, Hal Cazalet’s Sam, doesn’t have more to do). But the second half flags, with hazy storylines further obscured by technical problems which scuppered the back-projection of Jan Pienkowski’s illustrations.The packed audience at The Old Market clearly enjoyed themselves though. Many having come in pirate garb, they joined enthusiastically in the final chorus, dancing in the aisles. A cut above many other family operas, with a little tightening Captain Blood certainly deserves a future.

What impresses most is the coherence of the action in terms of both interacting individuals and the highly involved chorus; the show is clear in narrative as well as in its use of symbolism – the swan that finally transforms into Elsa’s lost brother is beautifully realised.Musically, the evening is a feast for Wagner fans. Both orchestra and chorus are on exceptional form, while WNO music director Lothar Koenigs sustains momentum while maintaining the finest quality tone.Emma Bell is on her mettle as Elsa, a role that proves ideal for her voice and personality. Peter Wedd never falters in his vocally dynamic, visually other worldly Lohengrin. Ortrud takes versatile mezzo Susan Bickley right up to her limits, though she remains authoritative. Claudio Otelli’s Telramund conveys the coward relying on his stronger wife’s determination to keep him going. Suffering from a throat infection, Matthew Best nevertheless struggles manfully onwards as King Henry.Yet it’s not just the excellence of individual performances that makes the evening unforgettable but the way in which they coalesce into a superbly integrated piece of music drama. The result is certainly one of the operatic highlights of the year.

In the second half we see the results, in which prima donna Ariadne laments her abandonment by Theseus until swept off her feet by the arrival of the god, Bacchus; meanwhile vaudeville star Zerbinetta and her troupe distract her along the way.Glyndebourne’s staging, by the young German director Katharina Thoma, making her UK debut, and designed by Julia Muer, refers self-consciously to country houses, notably Glyndebourne itself, where John Christie put on high-quality operatic performances from 1934 onwards. In the first half, the hustle and bustle of last-minute rearrangements is deftly and wittily sketched in; then suddenly, at the end of the Prologue, the Luftwaffe arrives and bombs fall. In the far less convincing second half, the damaged house has become a hospital for the wounded, with Ariadne lying on her bed until bailed-out airman Bacchus arrives to become her new lover. It’s very definitely a show of two halves; the first half works, the second doesn’t.Despite that, some worthwhile performances emerge from the wreckage: Soile Isokoski’s finely phrased Ariadne, Laura Claycomb’s teasing Zerbinetta, and especially Kate Lindsey’s luminous Composer. Sergey Skorokhodov makes heavy weather of Bacchus, but Thomas Allen is a superb Music Master. Departing music director Vladimir Jurowski draws delectable sounds from the London Philharmonic in the pit.

It opens at the early 19th-century Edinburgh assembly of the Celtic Society, presided over by Scott himself (duplicated in the opera by the minor character, Serano, sung by Robin Leggate). Throughout the show, Scott/Serano and Albina (Justina Gringyte), who doubles as Rossini, stage-manage proceedings. There’s far too much of them and their top-hatted colleagues, who virtually drown the action out. Amid the clutter of Dick Bird’s sets and Yannis Thavoris’ two-period costumes, we lose sight of what is happening between Joyce DiDonato’s Elena and her three prospective lovers.Attention focuses on the singing, which is high-quality. DiDonato commands her shapely vocal line and manages her coloratura expressively. Juan Diego Florez triumphs in the role of Uberto (King James V of Scotland in disguise), firing off top notes with impeccable brilliance. Michael Spyres, brought in from later in the run to replace an unwell Colin Lee as Highland Chieftain Rodrigo, acquits himself honourably, and Daniela Barcellona is superb as Elena’s true love, Malcom. Michele Mariotti conducts decently enough, though a production that is more commentary on the original than a realisation of it keeps the show at a distance.

In the event, Goold was released to concentrate on an upcoming film, and the company instead hired an operatic novice – Carrie Cracknell.New to opera Cracknell may be, but her track record in spoken theatre – especially in her associations with the Gate and the Royal Court – is highly impressive. In the event, the first-night audience acclaimed her realisation of Wozzeck with unalloyed enthusiasm.Berg’s work, first performed in 1925, is a 20th-century masterpiece and one of the darkest operas ever composed. A setting of Georg Buchner’s fragmentary play Woyzeck, itself based on the real-life case of former soldier Johann Christian Woyzeck, who murdered his mistress in Leipzig in 1821 and was executed three years later, it sets the crime in the context of the central character’s steady disintegration and his struggle to contend with callous bullying by his social superiors.The opera’s view of the human condition and the everyday cruelties inflicted on the downtrodden is almost uniformly bleak. Berg’s score is also hard-hitting, its largely atonal idiom forcing the audience to confront the darkness of the subject at a level of unremitting intensity. Yet, paradoxically, it is also shot through with sudden, piercing moments of sonic beauty. Under ENO’s music director Edward Gardner, it is realised with detailed focus and utter conviction; its coherence and emotional punch proving indelibly powerful.With Tom Scutt’s tiered, multi-location set and contemporary costumes by Oliver Townsend and Naomi Wilkinson, Cracknell’s visualisation places the opera in the here and now. Leigh Melrose’s Wozzeck is a soldier returned from one of Britain’s foreign wars, ekeing out a living on the edge of a group of drug-dealers who include some of his former comrades.But he is also mentally disturbed, haunted by the ghosts of those he saw killed, British and non-British alike – the Union Jack-draped coffins that are carried in and remain in the bar of the pub where he and his cronies hang out offer a particularly telling image, in an evening stuffed full of them.In what is his finest ENO performance to date, Melrose makes Wozzeck real before our eyes, giving him a complexity that seizes and holds the audience’s sympathy. As his friend Andres, Adrian Dwyer’s wheelchair-bound veteran plays video games obsessively. Tom Randle’s Captain and James Morris’ Doctor torment the vulnerable Wozzeck in minutely conceived and executed performances.Sara Jakubiak makes a memorable UK debut as Marie, her superb lyric soprano fleshing out the troubled lifestyle of Wozzeck’s conflicted girlfriend. Bryan Register makes his mark as the violently macho Drum Major who seduces her. Clare Presland as Marie’s hostile neighbour Margaret, Andrew Greenan as the drunken First Apprentice, Peter van Hulle as the weird Idiot, and Harry Polden as Marie and Wozzeck’s Child, are all superb.The result is a triumph for ENO, and a must-see show.

Edwards and his team – costume designer Gabrielle Dalton and projection designer Andrzej Goulding – draw on a more modern set of visuals to highlight the work’s ongoing relevance: photographs taken by the Czech Jewish refugee Rudi Weissenstein in Palestine in the late 1930s and 1940s. Printed in the programme book, a timeline of the State of Israel runs from 1917 to 2006.Such contemporary parallels for the Biblical narrative are not new. In her programme article, Handel expert Ruth Smith points out how the oratorio’s original English audiences would have seen themselves in terms of the ancient Israelites. The result is a thought-provoking piece of theatre that deserves to be more widely seen than its short current run allows.Though the staging is simple, it is consistently effective – Edwards lights his minimal sets, which make prominent use of the backstage fabric of the Grand Theatre, with considerable flair. Stephen Layton’s conducting needs more punch and clarity, as does Daniel Norman’s Joshua. But there’s powerful work from the chorus, including the company’s youth contingent, while Henry Waddington as the senior Israelite Caleb, Fflur Wyn as his daughter Achsah and Jake Arditti as the warrior Othniel all excel.

That revival gathers pace with Cologne Opera’s production of Die Gezeichneten – the title means The Stigmatized, or The Branded – a work much admired in the years following its 1918 premiere.Schreker’s own libretto tells a strange tale, set in Renaissance Italy, about Alviano, a lonely, hunchbacked nobleman who offers his island of aesthetic pleasures to the citizens of Genoa; but his gesture is compromised by the use his friends have made of the island as a haunt of orgiastic excess — some of it distinctly sinister.It’s a strange blend of mystery, eroticism, symbolism and alienation, for which Schreker’s heady late-Romantic style, with its subtly coloured harmony and super-enriched orchestration, is the only possible musical match. If the work itself is enigmatic and arguably too long, Patrick Kinmonth’s self-designed production makes something strikingly memorable out of it. Retaining the Renaissance background in many of the costumes, Kinmonth counterpoints them in his main setting of a grungy car mechanic’s workshop, where Stefan Vinke’s modern-day Alviano lives out his perverse sexual fantasies. The result is disturbing but fascinating. Vocally and physically tireless, Vinke is well matched by Nicola Beller Carbone as Carlotta, the woman with whom he is obsessed, and by Simon Neal as his friend and rival Tamare. Markus Stenz conducts an atmospheric account of this weird, fantastical piece.

Vines’ mentally unstable friend Sadaqat tells Kramer that Vines and Jacquemain have become entrapped in a garden, which Kramer eventually finds buried beneath a motorway. There he discovers that Zenna Briggs, who has supported his work on the documentary film about the disappearances, is actually behind them – ‘an undying architect of the occult in the 21st century’, as Mitchell’s synopsis puts it. In further strange and enigmatic plot-twists, Kramer finally manages to escape Zenna’s sunken garden, but does so trapped in her now mortal body.The result is not that easy to follow, especially given the mixed diction of the cast, with the honourable exception of Roderick Williams as Kramer, who sings and acts his role with considerable distinction. Unsurprisingly, the clearest parts of the show are the largely spoken extracts from Toby’s film, in which the friends and relatives of the vanished talk about the circumstances that led up to their disappearance. Van der Aa’s word-setting is sometimes awkward, with his vocal lines seemingly dislocated from the chamber orchestral accompaniment beneath – over which conductor Andre de Ridder presides efficiently. Too much of the music, however, is anonymous. A sugar-coating of electronics adds in a few extra tone colours, but there’s little in the way of musical characterisation, and the score largely registers as a background to the action rather than the main event. It’s a bad sign that one comes away with a set of striking visual images but little in the way of sharp musical memories.Yet the visuals are regularly compelling. Theun Mosk’s sets and lighting present the accoutrements of contemporary life in a media-obsessed environment, while the 3D effects – experienced from the beginning of the sunken garden sequence, with the audience forewarned to put on their glasses at this point – inject real magic into a show that generally has more mundanity than mystery about it. The inspiration for the sunken garden is the Eden Project in Cornwall, with some splashy psychedelic add-ons.The other individual performances are all perfectly decent, with Claron McFadden’s presence and striking high register giving weight to Zenna’s psychiatrist opponent Dr Marinus, Katherine Manley as the duplicitous Zenna herself and – on film or as holograms – Jonathan McGovern’s affable Vines and Kate Miller-Heidke’s troubled Amber, whose dancebeat-based music brings some momentum to a score that lacks pacing. The non-singing actors, too, make an impression with their filmed interviews, notably Stephen Henry’s slightly unhinged Sadaqat and Caroline Jay’s Portia, to whom Mitchell has given some blissfully funny lines. Yet it’s not enough to make up for the thinness of the score, which is by far the weakest element in the entire enterprise.

Not much is changed other than the names of the characters – here Daland becomes Donald and Erik becomes George. Everything else remains pretty much the same, though in Scutt’s inventive sets the visuals take their cue from Scottish ports in the 1970s and 1980s together with an oilrig. The result emphasises the ordinary, workaday background from which Wagner’s extraordinary heroine Senta emerges, and where she meets her fatal destiny in the shape of the mysterious Dutchman. Fehr’s staging, though, could do with sharper focus; the piece doesn’t always grip as it should.In particular the titular anti-hero registers as less than ideally demonic in the person of Peteris Eglitis, who needs a stronger personality, vocal as well as physical, to embody the otherworldly sea-captain. Rachel Nicholls does, though, bring considerable vocal power and intensity to Senta, maintaining the concentration of her focused soprano right up to the final climactic bars. Scott Wilde impresses as a forthright Donald, while Jeff Gwaltney’s George, after a generally centred performance, loses vocal momentum towards the end. Nicky Spence gives a lively account of Donald’s Helmsman.Francesco Corti’s conducting also needs more impetus. Despite committed work from both orchestra and chorus, there are some untidy moments, and dropping the prelude to Act II doesn’t help.

One of the co-commissioners of the piece, ROH2, suggests in their publicity material that the piece would be suitable for children from the age of 8 upwards, though if they haven’t read the book, they may find the episodic narrative a little hard to follow. A two-act structure, also, might have been effectively pruned down to one sizable act.No one should have difficulty with Bruce’s score, which without being memorable is certainly easy on the ear. Musically, the setting is pseudo-oriental, much of it sounding like Puccini’s Turandot, though on a much smaller scale. At its best, the result is entertaining, and comes over well here with the contemporary music ensemble Chroma conducted by Geoffrey Paterson.Mary Bevan sings Lila, the firework-maker’s daughter, who sets off on her quest to discover the secrets of her father Lalchand’s trade. She supplies boundless energy, as does Wyn Pencarreg as Lalchand himself. James Laing sings the countertenor role of the elephant Hamlet, one of many colourful characters Lila encounters on her adventures, while Amar Muchhala’s splendid lyric tenor gives him notable presence as Hamlet’s keeper, Chulak. Andrew Slater enjoys himself as Rambashi, the ferryman who turns out to be a pirate, and in John Fulljames’s lively production there’s a fair amount of doubling up from the versatile company. The evening’s best features are visual, with Dick Bird’s colourful designs and puppetry from Steve Tiplady and Sally Todd of Indefinite Articles consistently hitting the spot.

Previously seen at La Scala, Milan, its earnest austerity is presumably intended to neutralise the brazen, community-singing aspect of Verdi’s breakthrough opera.We are in a shades-of-grey world. Alison Chitty’s set, essentially a brick wall and a sandpit containing large rectangular slabs, is dwarfed sporadically by Luca Scarzella’s video projections, exploring the same motifs to impressive effect. The extensive use of real fire in Act II makes a particular impact amid so much monochrome.The post-Holocaust costuming, complete with cardies and specs, implies the second half of the 20th century but provides little in the way of social stratification to assist with plot and motivation. Everyone is a potential exile so everyone looks the same bar the odd skullcap. Booing from the amphitheatre on opening night suggests that detail is not always visible from parts of the house.Musically we are in safe hands. Conductor Nicola Luisotti blazes through the score with brisk efficiency and the vastly experienced Leo Nucci brings the requisite gravitas and a forgivable whiff of ham to his umpteenth assumption of the title role. That the voice, tired at the start, acquires greater authority as the night wears on is quite an achievement for a septuagenarian.Liudmyla Monastyrska’s villainous Abigaille is wonderfully secure vocally, even if her theatrical poses look dated. Vitalij Kowaljow, a fellow Ukrainian, acts as well as sings a finely focused Zaccaria, but why is this Hebrew prophet dressed as a young businessman?Verdi’s intentions are compromised, yet the evening arguably succeeds on its own terms. The chorus, specially reinforced, excels.

In practice, although neither orchestra nor chorus is as large as ideally desirable, the company pulls off this ambitious assignment with aplomb.Director James Conway moves the action forward from 14th-century Genoa to Italy in the 1970s; Boccanegra the pirate turned Doge becomes a black marketeer turned prime minister. Samal Blak’s spare set provides a stable platform for the twists and turns of the action to play out on, and Conway elucidates the dark corners of a plot sometimes written off as impenetrable. It isn’t here, with the individual singers filling in the back-histories of their characters conscientiously, and Conway skilfully clarifying their complex yet fascinating relationships.It’s a high quality cast throughout. Craig Smith offers a Boccanegra of developing greatness, his lithe, expressive baritone anchored to the notes. Keel Watson opposes him as a Fiesco of grandeur and depth, his rich bass superbly expressive. Rising star Elizabeth Llewellyn confirms her excellence as an Amelia of gleaming lyricism, musically distinguished and dramatically sympathetic. Charne Rochford’s Italianate tenor is pushed to its limits by the role of rebellious Gabriele Adorno, but he holds his vocal ground. Grant Doyle’s Paolo is a fine character study of ruthless malevolence, voiced with boldness and comprehension.Michael Rosewell conducts a performance notable for its Verdian style as well as its dramatic momentum. ETO’s orchestra plays with authority and subtlety. It’s an altogether remarkable show, well worth catching as it tours from Perth to Truro this spring.

A pupil of the French composer Olivier Messiaen, his own music has retained a keen sensitivity to the subtleties of orchestral colouring and a frequent delicacy of manner that both return as assets in this opera. His only previous work in the genre – the small-scale Into the Little Hill, also to a libretto by Martin Crimp, and based on the story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin – created a definite splash when premiered back in 2006.His new work is based on a 13th-century Occitan ballad from southern Europe. In the ballad, the poet Guillem becomes the lover of his patron’s wife. The patron discovers their adultery, kills Guillem and then serves up his heart to his unfaithful partner. Having consumed it, she defiantly states that she will never eat again in order to be able to savour her lover’s taste in her mouth forever – at which point her husband threatens to kill her, and she hurls herself instead from a tower.With minor adjustments this grim little tale is played out as the central narrative of Benjamin’s piece. The nobleman’s wife is Agnes; her husband is called the Protector, while her lover – in the opera a young artist employed by the Protector to illuminate a manuscript – is called the Boy. Crimp’s libretto surrounds these long-ago events with the commenting figures of three Angels, who in Mitchell’s staging also dress the characters and act as modern-day archivists, storing and examining ancient artefacts in an upstairs section of Mortimer’s multi-roomed set. The result develops a complex, layered set-up from something essentially simple.Crimp’s characters also narrate their own actions, adding “says the Protector” or “says the Boy” to their own direct statements – an artificial device that deliberately distances the audience from the story but which often seems merely fussy. Framing references to our contemporary world – the text mentions car-parks, air miles and shopping malls – feel intrusive rather than resonant.Yet the score is finely delivered, with each of the main singing roles immaculately written and superbly sung by Christopher Purves’ Protector, Bejun Mehta’s Boy and Barbara Hannigan’s Agnes. Benjamin’s music draws the ear into a refined and intricate sound-world, though occasionally, and less convincingly, violent orchestral gestures obtrude. The first-night audience gives it a warm welcome, though whether the piece possesses sufficient clarity or focus to remain in the repertoire seems uncertain.

Written in 1836 to a libretto by Salvadore Cammarano (with whom the composer had first collaborated the previous year on Lucia di Lammermoor), the opera concerns Edward III’s protracted siege of Calais, begun in 1346. In order to save their fellow citizens, six burghers (famously immortalised by Rodin) sacrifice themselves, responding to Edward’s demand in return for lifting the siege.In updating his production, James Conway has taken inspiration from the 1942 siege of Stalingrad. Within the brittle concrete set the rotation of a huge sewer pipe distinguishes the English outside the city walls from the French within. It’s a credible backdrop for the battle-weary English soldiers and the starving but resolute citizens, even if its grittiness is sometimes out of step with Donizetti’s score. Conway has also removed the third act (apparently considered weak by the composer) – in which Edward’s queen arrives and pleads for his clemency on behalf of the burghers. Almost by way of apology, an aria and an ensemble from Act III are shifted into Acts I and II respectively, and after the curtain calls the orchestra strikes up with the Ballabile from the Act III ballet music.The cast is uniformly good – Helen Sherman cuts a strong figure in the trouser role of the mayor’s son, Aurelio, matching her robust singing. Paula Sides’s Eleonora (Aurelio’s wife) is youthful yet solid-toned. Along with Cozmin Sime (Edward III) and Eddie Wade (the mayor, Eustachio) they express their hopes, fears and patriotism with strong credibility.

After losing her way in a bout of gambling, and after shaking off a cyber-stalker, Lisette falls in love with Gulliver (whose real-world ‘host’ is the elder son of Elizabeth’s therapist). Gradually, Elizabeth becomes addicted to her younger avatar and, on her death, becomes one with her.Gough’s score is often minimalist in style, with edgy wind and brass colouring repeated riffs, but there are plenty of intimate, lyrical moments too, and the music takes centre stage in the set-piece of Lisette and Gulliver’s doo-wop style a cappella wedding, complete with a hip pastor (radiantly sung by George Ikediashi). Finn Ross’s video animations, often running the full width and height of the three-tier set are brilliantly conceived and deftly integrated into the whole.Jean Rigby sings warmly as the initially crabby Elizabeth, and sounds completely at ease in this (for her) relatively unfamiliar idiom – though she is not always audible. Joanna Songi is the bright-eyed Lisette with a voice to match. With a fruity baritone and solid stage presence, Adam Gilbert impresses as Gulliver. Nicholas Collon conducts a 19-piece Aurora Orchestra, swelled to more than double that number by young student musicians.There may be some small storytelling details that need sharpening in this intergenerational undertaking, but it’s a very smart, collaboratively conceived production that has hit the ground running.

There’s little rapport between the pals Ferrando and Guglielmo or their respective lovers, sisters Dorabella and Fiordiligi. Neither is there much chemistry within the two pairs of lovers formed by this foursome – not even, more surprisingly, when the men return in disguise to woo the other’s lover.Don Alfonso may appear superior in his decorated long coat and wig, but he hardly comes across as the sly architect of a partner-swapping experiment. The housemaid Despina’s disguise as the doctor is of austere commedia dell’arte garb, without any entertaining gadget with which to draw out the poison supposedly taken by the men.The hesitance as the reconfigured couples get acquainted in the Act II garden scene is touching, although the addition of even a single shrub might have created some atmosphere amid the bare set. At the end, there is no sense of huge relief after the dallying girls have been found out and forgiven.Despite the fairly weak staging, the evening is a success, thanks to the singers and players. Laura Mitchell successfully conveys the troubled conscience that broadens Fiordiligi’s character, and Anthony Gregory is especially effective when employing the more intimate lyrical regions of his voice. Paula Sides provides a Despina with some attitude, despite suffering a whiplash injury.The main star is the orchestra, under the remarkably fresh and assured direction of James Burton – sprightly, dynamic and focused, yet also charming and wistful. This is worth attending for the orchestral playing alone.

In the title role, South African soprano Amanda Echalaz, a success story of British opera having worked her way up through leads in smaller companies such as English Touring Opera and Holland Park, where her Tosca won great acclaim. In 2009 she stepped in for Angela Gheorghiu at the ROH, a year later starring in a new production for English National Opera; now she claims the role for her own at the ROH. Physically and dramatically ideal – tall and slim, proud, capricious, tender and fiery – she is vocally solid too, delivering an affecting Visi d’arte.Massimo Giordano is a dashing, full-blooded Cavaradossi – though his will-he-won’t-he? run-ups to the money notes make for some uncomfortable moments (he always reached the heights safely on opening night). As brutish villain Scarpia, fluid baritone Michael Volle conveys a terrifically seat-squirming thuggishness.Maurizio Benini’s intuitive conducting, by turns electrifying and sensitive, coaxes blood-curdling brass and heart-rending strings from the magnificent ROH orchestra. Disappointingly, however, the climactic Te Deum lacks essential spine-tingling impact, mainly because the chorus is clumped at the back of the stage behind bars. This is a rare, but major, mistake in Kent’s otherwise sure-footed and powerful production.

Despite some fresh blood in the cast – notably Lucy Crowe’s Rosina and Andrew Kennedy’s Almaviva, both of them imaginatively cast and fully capable of tackling Rossini’s florid coloratura writing – this production, under revival director Peter Relton, is held back by its lack of onstage sparkle. Kennedy isn’t sure how drunk he’s expected to be when masquerading as a soldier in order to get close to Rosina and the Act I final ensemble – designed as a head-booming escalation of confusion – remains squarely earthbound. Thank goodness, then, for Andrew Shore’s dependably comic, hernia-suffering Bartolo, who effortlessly raises laugh after laugh. Amanda and Anthony Holden’s sharp and witty translation has been key to the production’s success as a whole.In the opera pit for the first time is Spanish-born flautist-turned-conductor Jaime Martin – assured if sometimes just a touch over-relaxed in pace, but completely in tune with his singers and as ready to reveal Rossini’s tart instrumental colourings as much as his MC Escher-like perpetually growing crescendos.There’s nothing here to spoil an evening, but this first night was a touch short of a thrilling one.

Dramatic focus is sometimes lost in the sprawling crowd scenes, as is some of Amanda Holden’s English translation, but there is clarity and captivating intimacy in the tete-a-tetes between the eponymous gypsy and her fated lover Don Jose – played on opening night (the roles in this revival are triple cast) by rich-voiced, though rather tame, Rachael Lloyd and Decca-signed American pin-up tenor Noah Stewart. Both impress, but neither match the honeyed solidity of Kevin Greenlaw’s bravura bull-fighter Escamillo.The biggest drawback with large arena opera is the need to amplify and artificially balance the singers and orchestra. But Bizet’s original scoring is well-served by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, and the singing from the young cast is high quality. If conductor Gareth Hancock’s measured tempi are calculated to keep the widely dispersed forces safely in check, he is generally successful – and he coaxes sensitively powerful playing in the tragic denouement.Lively gypsy dances provide some eye-catching moments, but the overall mood in the first three acts is oddly subdued. Hopefully it will find more sparkle as the run progresses. The big scale approach really pays off in the final act, however, when the bustling festivities outside the bullring offer the opportunity for a marvellous spectacle of unicycling, stilt-walking, flame-throwing glory.

Deriving from ancient Greek myths, the plot centres on the sorceress who takes revenge on her unfaithful lover, Jason, by murdering his new bride and even Jason’s and her own children. Charpentier presents this dark tale of betrayed love and unspeakable vengeance in music of striking power and imagination.David McVicar’s production places the action in a 1940s context, around the time of the Allied liberation of France. Bunny Christie’s stunning set presents a palatial room where a complex game of power politics, love and hate plays out, interspersed by and partly illustrated in the interventions of dancers who close four of the five acts with decorative divertissements. (The opera’s original prologue, praising Louis XIV, is left out.)With the feel of a period West End musical about it, Lynne Page’s choreography leaves a mixed impression, and the demons who aid Medea in her nefarious schemes look cliched. But the central drama is convincingly realised by an exceptional cast, led by Sarah Connolly’s majestically wronged anti-heroine. American tenor Jeffrey Francis makes a belated ENO debut as the double-dealing Jason, with soprano Katherine Manley sounding as pretty as she looks as his new squeeze, Creusa, and Brindley Sherratt supplying grand sonority and presence as her duplicitous father, Creon. Roderick Williams makes a great deal out of Orontes, Jason’s rival for Creusa’s love. While Christian Curnyn’s conducting is correct rather than captivating, this is still an evening to relish, for Charpentier’s score as much as the cast.

Company artistic director Oliver Mears directs alongside the gifted young conductor Nicholas Chalmers. Designer Simon Holdsworth presents a concentrated vision of the piece, the vital element of the stormy sea cleverly sketched in during the overture and the rigidly conventional world from which heroine Senta longs to escape brought vividly to life later on. After a slow start, Mears’ staging grows ever more absorbing and delivers the goods thrillingly in the later scenes.The central roles are all impressively sung. Bruno Caproni struggles to suggest the Dutchman’s full inner darkness, but vocally his large-scale singing fits the bill. Stephen Richardson has some way to go to develop the full potential of Senta’s jovially money-grubbing father Daland, while Paul McNamara conquers intermittent vocal insecurities to present huntsman Erik – Senta’s rejected local lover – effectively. But Giselle Allen’s Senta strikes home on all fronts, her authoritative, nuanced and grandly shaped vocalism matching a dramatic performance of considerable intensity.There’s vigorous work, too, from the company’s chorus, whose commitment is unstinting. The Ulster Orchestra is in the pit, giving, under Chalmers’ baton, a solidly convincing account of Wagner’s potent early-Romantic score, flooding the theatre with its heady emotional charge. The piece sounds superb in the fine acoustic of Frank Matcham’s glamorous late-Victorian auditorium, where the rising company is based and from which it is clearly going places.

Designer Helen Goddard’s costumes suggest a period closer to the opera itself (1892) than to the late-18th-century setting of Goethe’s novel, but the story of an outsider artist whose love for a married woman drives him to suicide comes over with intense power.Furtado’s detailed direction is responsive to the alternately delicate and passionate score, though the idea of having Werther watch action in which he is not involved does occasionally become intrusive. Nevertheless, this is an impressive main-stage debut.Her cast is unimpeachably fine from a dramatic point of view while vocally, too, the standard is high. US tenor Jonathan Boyd stars in the title role. If he lacks ideal power at the climaxes, his sensitivity and sense of style, added to his youth and good looks, make him near ideal as the doomed artist failing to secure a place in bourgeois society. Rejecting him for a man she does not love, Hungarian mezzo Viktoria Vizin makes a fully engaged Charlotte, her lush voice highlighting her character’s inner division. Roland Wood sings the dull but worthy Albert, his tone rich and his characterisation entirely three-dimensional. As Charlotte’s younger sister Sophie, Irish soprano Anna Devin blends charm with vulnerability and sings immaculately. Jonathan Best makes a great deal of Charlotte’s widowed father, while the group of children is perfect.Scottish Opera’s music director Francesco Corti conducts a superior account of this late-Romantic masterpiece, with the company’s orchestra on exceptional form.

Jean Cocteau’s original play amounts to an extended dramatic monologue on the telephone, during which the woman pours out her heart to the lover who is abandoning her. It is an emotionally searing work despite taking place within 40 minutes in a single dressing-room. Garrett gives a sublime performance – her acting skills, sharpened on the West End stage, to the fore – and there is some very clever directorial work, on either side of a mirror, by Aletta Collins.To follow, Henry Purcell’s Baroque Dido and Aeneas, his first opera and one of the earliest of the English school, is an interesting choice. Pamela Helen Stephen, of the luscious mezzo, also makes a most welcome return to the company, as Dido, Queen of Carthage, forsaken by Phillip Rhodes’s Trojan hero, Aeneas. Their separation, for reasons that have everything to do with tragic irony rather than their love for each other, is brought about by Heather Shipp’s delightfully devilish Sorceress.But it is as spectacle that this production will, perhaps, be most remembered, not surprising given Collins’ background in choreography. A series of spellbinding tableaux from the assembled dancers, spirits and witches, all resembling Dido in costume and appearance, adds to the supernatural element.The irrepressible Wyn Davis conducts both works with his usual fervour.

Its latest is Donizetti’s bel canto comedy L’elisir d’amore (The Elixir of Love), reconceived by Valentina Ceschi, who directs, with a libretto by Thomas Eccleshare. The 19th-century rural Italian village setting is swapped for 1950s Hollywood and Adina, the land-owning love interest, is a glitzy movie star, pursued by her pool-boy cum gardener (naturally, he’s working on a screenplay). He gets rich not, as in the original, through inheriting from his sick uncle, but after having his work snapped up by Warner Bros.Eccleshare’s libretto has enough entertaining lines even if it’s not consistently accomplished and the recontextualising seems to have weakened from drawing board to performance – Una Reynolds is too enchanting, too free of diva-like ego, to be a credible film star and Dulcamara, neatly dressed with jacket, bow tie and chapeau, hardly seems the typical stylist. But both are strong performers, the former combining vocal transparency with agility and the latter a real stand-out for his trusty compendium of comic gestures – combining a pinch each of Niles Crane and Mr Bean – and he can sing too.Marc Callahan impresses with his rich-toned Belcore and is winning both in his poolside preening and his virile wooing of Adina. (“Well, love’s the same as fighting,” he declares. “It’s fatal to delay.”) Only Alex Vearey-Roberts, as Nemorino, needs to warm into his role, to match his volume to the small space and explore more of the colour in his voice. John Gibbons’s arrangement of the score for piano (which he plays), saxophone and viola works very convincingly.

In some ways it’s a typical Pountney show – a bit overstated, a little too fond of the visually grotesque in Johan Engels’ stark but adaptable set and Marie-Jeanne Lecca’s costumes, with their preponderance of animal heads worn by the characters. But none of it goes against the spirit of the piece, while much of the letter, too, is observed. By the time the evening reaches its bloody climax with Lulu’s death at the hands of Jack the Ripper, you are persuaded by the sheer stagecraft with which Pountney’s vision is carried out and the full-on commitment of his entire cast.This is an evening of interest, too, in that WNO plays a new version of the piece. Berg died in 1935 with large parts of his third act as yet unwritten. Since 1979, the standard text has been a completion by Friedrich Cerha. Here Eberhard Kloke’s recent realisation is preferred, though on first hearing it’s not clear that it improves on Cerha’s style-sensitive filling-in of blank spaces. What is certain is the superb playing of WNO’s Orchestra under the company’s music director, Lothar Koenigs – one of the evening’s exceptional features.But there are impressive individual performances from Peter Hoare as a lyrical Alwa, Natascha Petrinsky’s lovelorn Geschwitz, Ashley Holland as the dark Dr Schon and the darker Jack, and an increasingly luminous account of the title role from Marie Arnet.

At 40, Holten has garnered considerable experience both as a director and administrator. Just like his predecessor at Covent Garden, Elaine Padmore, he previously ran the Royal Danish Opera in Copenhagen with flair, raising the house’s international profile considerably during his 11-year tenure.Though UK audiences have not thus far had the opportunity to experience Holten’s work live, his highly acclaimed Copenhagen Ring cycle was filmed for DVD and later won a Gramophone Award. More recently, he directed the feature film Juan, based on Mozart’s Don Giovanni and starring British baritone Christopher Maltman.His take on Tchaikovsky’s most popular opera, based on Pushkin’s verse novel, is in some senses traditional. The period evoked in Mia Stensgaard’s sets and Katrina Lindsay’s costumes is clearly 19th-century, but closer to Tchaikovsky’s era – the opera premiered in 1879 – than to Pushkin’s 1820s. Holten has described Onegin as ‘one of my favourite operas of all time’, and in the best parts of his staging, his insights into the characters and their motivations shine through in the perceptive detail of the individual acting performances, from the largest roles down to the smallest.But there are problems nevertheless. The cast is led by two outstanding artists – British baritone Simon Keenlyside and Bulgarian soprano Krassimira Stoyanova. He sings Onegin, whose rejection of the wide-eyed, vulnerable Tatyana (Stoyanova) near the opera’s beginning is ironically mirrored at the close, when he bumps into her years later and realises that he loves the now married woman – this time it is Tatyana who rejects Onegin, while admitting that she still loves him.Both artists sing with exceptional imagination and commitment. In Stoyanova’s case, particularly, it is hard to conceive a voice more perfectly aligned with the needs of the role – she combines Slavic vocal firmness and heft with the purest lyricism. But both performers, too, look distinctly on the mature side for the characters Pushkin imagined for the first part of the narrative, where Onegin is supposed to be 26 and Tatyana several years younger. Perhaps this discrepancy tempted Holten to introduce dancers to represent the same characters when young, and to have the singers view their own behaviour, as it were, in retrospect. Either way, and despite the focused participation of Thom Rackett (Onegin) and Vigdis Hentze Olsen (Tatyana), their involvement seems increasingly intrusive and distracting as the show proceeds.The opera’s traditional opportunities for large-scale choreography – Tchaikovsky provides some fabulous set-pieces for social dancing – scarcely materialise, while the direction of the chorus registers as stiff, and their at-times curious costuming is unconvincing – black bombazine dresses for the female peasants?Despite such failures, there are some exceptional individual performances. As Onegin’s friend Lensky, Slovak tenor Pavol Breslik sings with purposeful intensity – though having him lie motionless on stage for two entire scenes following his death in a stage duel seems a big ask. Peter Rose brings authority to Tatyana’s elderly husband Prince Gremin, though his extra-curricular presence in the final scene seems as nonsensical as his unmotivated jealousy of Onegin earlier on. Christophe Mortagne delivers an unforgettable cameo as Monsieur Triquet.In the pit, rising star Robin Ticciati conducts a dynamic, passionate musical performance. But overall this represents an uncertain directorial debut for Holten, with a smattering of boos mingling with the cheers at the final curtain.

Back in 2006, the company’s most recent production of Verdi’s popular work based on Alexandre Dumas’ La Dame aux Camelias – by opera novice Conall Morrison – failed to hit the spot, and never returned. Whether ENO will have better luck with Peter Konwitschny’s staging, shared with Opera Graz, remains to be seen.Konwitschny is certainly an experienced opera director, though making his UK debut at the age of 68, his work inevitably has the feel of a blast from the past rather than being cutting edge. His is a dour view of the piece, with none of the characters sympathetically drawn, and there’s a strong sense of alienation resulting from his one-dimensional view. La Traviata traditionally engages the audience’s emotions directly, especially through the pathos of the heroine’s self-sacrifice. But while the music is never less than decently presented here – though it’s been heavily cut to turn the three-act original into a one-act show – there’s little attempt to move the audience at all.Alfredo is a bookish nerd, Germont a grotesque bully, Violetta herself brittle rather than generous. Some fine singing from Corinne Winters, Ben Johnson and – bar a few rough edges – Anthony Michaels-Moore fails to humanise the piece.It’s impossible not to admire the commitment with which the cast follows Konwitschny’s instructions, but given ENO’s desperate financial state, one wonders whether this new production is not just yet another example of dodgy judgement.

Adding to the constant air of ambiguity, the muted, nuanced tones and varying structures of Conor Murphy’s set, too, make this show as fascinating a visual experience as it is a musical one.And musically it is very fine. Paul Nilon has never sounded stronger or more engaged than he is as Titus, surrounded by courtiers of varying degrees of disaffection or disloyalty. As chief-plotter Vitellia, furious that she is twice passed over as Empress, Annemarie Kremer blazes with angry malice – in love with her, Helen Lepalaan’s conflicted Sesto is putty in her hands. Kathryn Rudge registers movingly as Sesto’s devoted friend Annio and Fflur Wyn with warmth as his sister Servilia.Normally not much more than a functionary of the plot, even Publio makes a mark in the hands of Henry Waddington. Throughout, the challenging vocal lines are securely delivered and the opera’s showpieces hit home.Douglas Boyd conducts, with a flexibility and rhetorical command that ensures that the score’s drama comes over, and with a sense of style that draws playing of historically informed expertise from Opera North’s orchestra.

The four bohemians make a glorious noise together, and only the very highest sustained notes prove a slight challenge for the otherwise impressively voiced leading couple.The strong singing is undoubtedly the best thing about the production, however. Everything else – from the drab painted backdrops and cobbled-together costumes (possibly some got lost on the journey here: on opening night the Rodolfo and Mimi wore modern dress, at odds with the 1833 setting) to the self-conscious chorus acting, scrawny string tone and ragged ensemble of the 30-piece touring orchestra – has a whiff of amateur dramatics. Worse still, the frantic scrolling subtitles at the foot of the stage are a constant distraction.Yet the company’s endearingly quaint charm and sincerity compensate significantly for these shortcomings. The shaky ensemble ought swiftly be ironed out as the tour progresses, and then this will be a highly enjoyable night out for anyone who appreciates good singing and a traditional – if rather creaky – production.

Leading the onstage team is John Tomlinson, returning to the title role and humanising the extraordinary creation at its heart. The complex physical apparatus Tomlinson wears to present his bullish exterior does not diminish the potency of his tone, through which he makes surprisingly sympathetic the destructive force of the Minotaur – condemned to a perpetual cycle of misery and violence. It remains a performance of tremendous authority. This revival, in fact, marks the 35th anniversary of the great British bass-baritone’s debut in the house, and the first night was crowned by a celebration of his ongoing career.Also returning are Christine Rice’s sophisticated Ariadne, desperate to escape the island with Theseus, sung with riveting power by Johan Reuter. Andrew Watts’ eerie Snake Priestess, Alan Oke’s menacing Hiereus and Elisabeth Meister’s vulture-like Ker all add to the tremendous impact of the piece.Birtwistle’s score is characteristically abrasive, at times hitting home to devastating effect; yet elsewhere its hyper-tense lyricism is equally impressive. Wigglesworth conducts a performance that plumbs its sinister depths as well as rising to terrifying heights. It’s an outstanding achievement from all concerned.

Sadly, the condition of his voice on this occasion was worrying. The top register felt stressed and diminished. Many notes were approached gingerly and then cut short. A few phrases were entirely dropped. Despite a game acting performance, this is not the vocal level he needs to reach to hold a position as an international tenor. [It has since transpired that Villazon has been suffering from acute bronchitis and was replaced for several shows by Ukrainian tenor Dmytro Popov]. Let’s hope it was just an off-night.Latvian soprano Maija Kovalevska sings Mimi. Her voice has some stamina if not quite enough power or stability to make her mark as the luminous personality Puccini envisaged, though, like Villazon, she is more than presentable dramatically.But some of the production’s other newcomers hit the spot. Norwegian baritone Audun Iversen’s full, rounded tone provided the basis for a warm and winning Marcello. Serbian bass-baritone David Bizic enters fully into the spirit of the production as Schaunard. Ukrainian-American soprano Stefania Dovhan has the looks and personality to command attention as Musetta, and much of her singing is bright and breezy. Best of all was the Argentine bass Nahuel Di Pierro, who seized all his opportunities as Colline and provided the evening’s vocal highlight with his Coat Song.Two stalwart British artists – Jeremy White and Donald Maxwell – give flawless accounts of Benoit and Alcindoro respectively, and Sir Mark Elder’s conducting is precise, perceptive and flexible.

It’s a brave undertaking to revive this mammoth, vocally demanding piece, and if the end result is less than convincing it is undeniably a collector’s item.Born in 1791, the German-born composer moved to Italy to perfect his operatic technique and then transferred to Paris, where this Gothic fantasy about good and evil was a huge success in 1831, establishing him as the most admired operatic creator of his day. Later his erstwhile protege Wagner attacked him fiercely – on grounds at least as much racial as aesthetic (Meyerbeer was Jewish) – and his works gradually sank into near oblivion. This staging adds to a tentative sense of revival.Robert the Devil might impress more given a serious production instead of the semi-flippant one Laurent Pelly mounts, which sends up the medieval romantic setting in a sequence of ugly and gruesomely colourful designs. Under conductor Daniel Oren, the score often feels bitty and conventional, though the temperature rises in the final act, when the Norman knight Robert discovers that his trusted companion is not merely his father but the devil himself. Bryan Hymel throws himself with success at the arduous title role, with John Relyea solid if uncharismatic as the demonic Bertram. Marina Poplavskaya is cool but vocally centred as Robert’s foster-sister Alice, who saves him from damnation, while Patrizia Ciofi is expressively expert in the coloratura role of his beloved Isabelle.

The linchpin, as he has been for many years, is Richard Suart’s brilliantly comic Ko-Ko, his hotly anticipated topical “little list” of candidates for the chop this time including Pippa Middleton and Lord Leveson – “I’ve got him on my list, in case I’m on his list!” Newcomers Robert Murray and Mary Bevan are a well-matched, fresh-voiced pair of young lovers, delightfully at home in the idiom, and Yvonne Howard excels as the hideous Katisha – funny but also sympathetic, and ravishingly sung. The redoubtable Richard Angas returns as a wonderfully bluff Mikado. The music fizzes along under David Parry’s assured and affectionate direction, gems such as “The sun, whose rays” treated with the seriousness they deserve. It is a treat to hear Sullivan’s glorious score rendered by one of our finest opera orchestras.Since its record-breaking original 1885 run, The Mikado has remained the most popular of Gilbert & Sullivan’s comic operas. Miller’s version, though clever and terrific fun, is not the last word, and its hyperactive staging does not always respect the music. It could happily run for another 25 years, but ENO should seriously consider quitting while it’s ahead, to reflect the opera’s timeless genius through another director’s prism – or, even more courageously, offer London audiences the chance to experience the magic of other evergreen Gilbert and Sullivan collaborations such as Patience or Iolanthe.

By bringing in Calixto Bieito’s production, developed with a number of companies since it debuted at the Peralada Festival in 1999, ENO has acquired an eminently viable version which looks set to excite audiences in the way its predecessor failed to do.Bieito, has, of course, previous at this address, though neither of his earlier ENO stagings a decade ago – A Masked Ball and Don Giovanni – won anything like universal approval. His Carmen, despite its rather vague setting in the 1970s and on the fringes of Spanish territory, perhaps in one of Spain’s former colonies in North Africa, is an altogether more focused achievement. Bieito’s penchant for excess, however, remains in the aggressively macho antics of the soldiers in Act 1, whose relentless pelvic thrusting and gross misogyny threaten to become absurd. Elsewhere, especially in the final duet between Ruxandra Donose’s feisty Carmen and Adam Diegel’s slightly over-parted Don Jose, his direction grips. It’s certainly never boring.Musical standards are high under conductor Ryan Wigglesworth, with impeccably precise and refined playing from the orchestra and spirited singing from the chorus. Donose plays a complex woman determined to hold on to her independence at whatever cost. Elizabeth Llewellyn offers one of the most beautifully sung interpretations of Micaela you will ever hear. Leigh Melrose’s Escamillo needs more charisma and a stronger lower register. But the staging is sharp, clear and energised, and regularly hits the emotional spot dead on.

The periodic heavy rumble of commuter trains overhead – which, in other contexts, may be a distraction – is entirely congruous with the updated setting of a cash-strapped artists’ flat in central London. Lucy Read’s naturalistic set design – large throw-covered sofa, student prints adorning the walls – is thoroughly convincing. Director and librettist Robin Norton-Hale’s version of the story, laden with modern references from “David” Cameron to “Strictly”, rings true with one crucial exception – it is, fortunately, completely implausible that anyone could die of tuberculosis in the UK in the 21st century.In the abridged second act, the action is located at the back and in the aisles of the house-lit auditorium, forcing the audience to twist around in their seats or – encouraged by the cast – stand in the aisles. Inevitably some will feel more comfortable in this situation than others – but the effect, turning the audience into a milling pub crowd, is imaginative and positive. Realistically, but frustratingly, it’s not always easy amid the hubbub to follow the plot.With adequate but undistinguished singing (the three main roles are triple-cast), feebly supported by lid-down piano accompaniment, the musical experience does little justice to Puccini’s beautiful score. But, thanks to lively and committed performances, it is frequently fun – and the tautly-played final scene carries as emotional a punch as any opera house performance.

More roughly hewn and bordering on the vulgar this time around, the show is in danger of losing sight of the piece’s essential warmth and charm. Bruno Campanella’s lackadaisical conducting doesn’t help.There are good deeds, however, along the way. Italian baritone Fabio Capitanucci plays the handsome braggart Sergeant Belcore with a perfectly judged god’s-gift-to-woman attitude – his vital vocalism suits the part to a nicety. That giant of a singer, Ambrogio Maestri, draws quack-potion seller Dr Dulcamara with a broad brushstroke but bags of savoir faire – in particular, he knows how to work an audience to the best possible effect.As Adina, the upmarket heroine who eventually capitulates to an illiterate peasant, Aleksandra Kurzak has all the notes but is on the cold side – she doesn’t so much melt into Nemorino’s arms as condescend to unfreeze a little. Yet the point of the piece is that she realises that the tongue-tied hero’s good heart is more important than money or macho sex appeal.Roberto Alagna presents the lovesick village lad, though at 49 he’s starting to look a little old for the part. His voice remains centred, vibrant and fleshy, but he’s not one for the bel canto subtlety the best exponents employ to make the music magical. His showpiece aria, Una furtiva lagrima, is impressively delivered but it doesn’t bring a tear to the eye, which is its raison d’etre. A self-regard has crept into his acting, too much of which registers as showing off.

The text meant a good deal to the composer, who made musical settings of it, large and small, over a period of more than 40 years – culminating in this piece, which retells the narrative of Pilgrim’s perilous journey from the City of Destruction to the Celestial City in his own libretto.Vaughan Williams was not a believer in a conventional sense, moving from atheism to what his wife called ‘a cheerful agnosticism’. Veteran Japanese director Yoshi Oida’s sympathetic staging, imaginatively designed by Tom Schenk and with some stunning costumes for the Vanity Fair scene by Sue Willmington, sets the piece in a prison whose cells and cages are moved around brilliantly to form the locales for individual scenes. Though there are strange interventions – Pilgrim is eventually executed by electric chair in an ambience that has a First World War feel to it, before coming back to life to deliver his final envoi – the spiritual heart of the piece comes over powerfully, including its simplistic and sententious moral judgements.The score remains problematic. There is much that is beautiful in Vaughan Williams’ characteristically visionary writing, and conductor Martyn Brabbins is in charge of a carefully charted performance. Yet its ruminative mood and slow tempo approach is apt to be repetitive and anti-dramatic.The principals offer conviction, with Roland Wood achieving greatness in the role of Pilgrim.

She starts with Sendak’s classic images and brings them to life in visuals perfectly realised for the context. It would be wonderful if this fine achievement – which began life at this year’s Aldeburgh Festival – could have an afterlife.The two works themselves show Knussen’s easy mastery of operatic writing – if only he could be induced to compose another. Wild Things, first performed in its final form in 1984, is pure magic from start to finish. The tale of naughty-boy Max travelling to the land of the Wild Things and partying with them is told in music of immediacy yet intricacy, glittering here in this performance founded on the playing of the Britten Sinfonia under Ryan Wigglesworth. Higglety Pigglety Pop!, about the adventures of Jennie, the Sealyham Terrier searching the wider world for fame and fortune, is more diffuse in its trajectory and at times more sombre, but its score is just as fascinating. Wild Things on its own would make an ideal Christmas show for one of our major companies.They could certainly co-opt this excellent cast, in which the all the secondary roles are vividly taken. Graeme Danby’s bass stands out in both shows, while Claire Booth’s Max and Lucy Schaufer’s Jennie are superb.

So Wexford’s revival of what is usually regarded as the best of them is particularly welcome.To a libretto by Delius and his wife Jelka, the work is based on a story by the 19th-century Swiss writer Gottfried Keller and was premiered in Berlin in 1907. Farmers Marti and Manz fall out over a waste plot separating their land and are ruined by the consequent lawsuits. Meanwhile, their children Sali and Vreli – forbidden to see each other following the row – have disobeyed and fallen in love, though they are rejected by their community. Eventually, they decide to take their own lives by drowning in a leaking barge floating down the river.Delius’ score – atmospheric and individual, despite the heavy influence of Wagner – is vividly performed under Rory Macdonald, and comes over as more consistently dramatic than its reputation would suggest. Designed by Jamie Vartan, Stephen Medcalf’s staging keeps the narrative focused, though the clowns and acrobats who liven up the fair scene do so at some cost to the central theme and take up too much of the famous interlude, The Walk to the Paradise Garden. Strong vocal performances throughout, with Andrew Greenan’s Marti and Quentin Hayes’ Manz battling grandly and David Stout a potent symbolic figure as the Dark Fiddler. John Bellemer’s Sali and Jessica Muirhead’s Vreli rise to the quasi-Wagnerian challenges of the title roles.

Seeing Thaddeus Strassberger’s busy production (shared with the Bard Festival in the US, where it was staged in July) there are obvious reasons why, despite the composer’s immense talent.The plot he picked tells an over-complex, operetta-like tale about King Henry III of France, elected King of Poland but unwilling to do the second job. Swapping identities with his friend the Count of Nangis, he joins a plot to drive himself out of his own country and at one point is even co-opted to assassinate himself. Fussy and hard to follow though the narrative already is, Strassberger’s joke-a-minute staging, garishly designed by Kevin Knight and Mattie Ullrich, makes matters worse, not  better, and the piece comes over as pointlessly facetious.The second act, presented as a variety show broadcast from a Polish television studio, is hyperactive nonsense. Chabrier’s score, much of which is gorgeously written – the highlights include a vast choral waltz in Act II and a similarly colourful polonaise in Act III – would work better in a kinder context.As it is, Jean-Luc Tingaud conducts a spirited account of the piece, with the Wexford chorus and orchestra sounding better than ever this year. Standout performances from Liam Bonner as the reluctant king, Luigi Boccia as his friend and replacement the Count, Mercedes Arcuri as Polish slave girl Minka and Nathalie Paulin as Alexina, wife to the chief plotter, Frederic Goncalves’s Duke of Fritelli, partially redeem the misconceived visuals.

It’s not entirely unknown in the UK – Opera Holland Park has staged it twice, and there’s a deservedly famous tenor aria which carries in its profound melancholy all the emotional power of Italian opera in a nutshell.The tragic rural plot centres on Federico, son of the widowed farmer’s wife Rosa Mamai, who has fallen in love with a beautiful girl who breaks his heart with her infidelities. In the original the girl from Arles never appears, but in director Rosetta Cucchi’s production, Federico is haunted by her like a ghost. As he steadily disintegrates, his mother – emotionally obsessed with her eldest child while ignoring her younger, also mentally weak son – is powerless to help him.Cucchi and designer Sarah Bacon present an often enigmatic visualisation that nevertheless strikes him with tremendous resonance, aided by the originality and individuality of Cilea’s score itself. If nothing else, this production – superbly conducted by David Angus – reveals it as an outstanding achievement.So too do the singers, led by Russian tenor Dmitry Golovnin, who sings honourably throughout and makes the famous lament into something unforgettable, Italian mezzo Annunziata Vestri, grand and terrible as the tormented Rosa Mamai, and her soprano compatriot Mariangela Sicilia as Vivetta, the ‘nice’ girl Federico isn’t interested in. But the entire company, like the opera itself, impresses with its integrity.

Director Sir Thomas Allen even has Richard Burkhard’s Papageno as an emcee figure, step out onto the apron during the overture to summon Nicky Spence onto stage – his modern dress soon replaced with Tamino’s princely white togs.Simon Higlett’s seven-windowed rotunda design is stunning and practical. It is lined with moveable anatomy theatre seating, done out in burnished wrought iron, with furnaces and industrial workers beneath, top-hatted gentry above. Mark Jonathan makes full use of small, modern light-sources in his clever lighting.Kit Hesketh-Harvey’s often earthy translation gives plenty of space for asides and embellishments in the comic business. The Ladies of the Night relish the freedom as does Papageno. There’s balance, though, ensuring that the mysticism of Tamino’s ordeals are not swamped. Indeed, the serious elements – and outmoded sexual politics – suit the Victorian benevolence hinted at through the design.The big central relationships all play out well, Burkhard’s livewire nervousness antidote to Spence’s stern sincerity. Laura Mitchell pushes and probes Pamina’s emotional level to the edge, while Tamino’s emotions move in the opposite direction, from infatuated lad to valid candidate for enlightenment. Ruth Jenkins’ Papageno rises easily to equal Burkhard’s vocal eloquence.Ekhart Wycik drives the excellent Orchestra of Scottish Opera with feeling and understanding. The vocal performances are solid, rather than soaring, although Jonathan Best – perfectly cast verbally – lacks in the lower range. Mari Moriya’s powerfully voiced Queen of the Night does soar, while sacrificing clarity for depth in her Act II aria.

In fact it’s a peculiarly tame affair – despite its updated setting, a pithy translation from Jeremy Sams (in which the monied Don topically refers to the ‘plebeians’) and a good degree of dramatic force in the pit under conductor Edward Gardner.Apart from one scene, in which Iain Paterson’s Giovanni lunges from behind to grope Zerlina’s crotch, there’s little impression of a man driven by a febrile carnal appetite, and his opening encounter with Donna Anna lacks sex, violence or passion. Likewise you’d barely know that Donna Elvira, though sung with assurance by Sarah Redgwick, is debilitatingly bewitched by Giovanni.Ian MacNeil’s low-budget sets change, and rotate, frequently, and tend to restrict the action to the centre of the stage. And did Masetto really attempt to hide (also centre-stage) behind a low-hanging light fitting?The costumes and ribbons in the third scene, in which Zerlina, Masetto and the locals celebrate the couple’s forthcoming wedding, are decidedly sober, contrasting with Giovanni’s kitschy heart-shaped balloons. But Leporello is appealingly cast as a greasy-haired anorak, whose catalogue of his master’s sexual conquests takes the entertaining form of a full-blown, graph-laden slide presentation.The singers do well under the circumstances. Katherine Broderick’s Donna Anna is direct in tone but capable of touching warmth, and Sarah Tynan sings Zerlina with richness across her range. In the title role Paterson’s voice is attractive but, the trouble is, his laid-back character is, too.

Unfortunately, he comes home from work unexpectedly one day to discover her occupying it with his colleague, Machado. Feeling it incumbent upon him to do something appropriately manly, he challenges the macho Machado to a duel, though his own friends don’t think he’s up to it. They are eventually proved right. It’s a chance meeting with Ludovina outside the opera house that leads them tentatively towards a rapprochement.The result is an ironic comedy set in an old-fashioned style by Philips, replete with numerous references to the distinctive popular Portuguese genre of fado – among the most colourful parts of the score as sung by mezzo Lauren Easton, who plays the unlikely role of the sofa in Frederic Wake-Walker’s sometimes hyperactive production. The physical comedy is inclined to be overstated.But the two central players – Michael Wallace as the nervy Godofredo and Gabriela Istoc as the embarrassed Ludovina – chart their individual journeys intelligently, and the other performances fit well alongside, even if one or two are overplayed.At 80 minutes, the piece feels on the long side, and not all of the score sticks in the mind; Philips’ pastiches tend to upstage his own style, technically adroit though his writing invariably is, and well conveyed by conductor Gareth Hancock plus a hard-working cast and ensemble.

Rather than just playing the standard edition of the score, it takes in several rarely performed sections. A few compensatory cuts are made, and there’s some altering of the usual order of service.More radically, the mezzo role of Marguerite’s innocent young admirer Siebel is reassigned to tenor – a part unimpressively undertaken by Robert Anthony Gardiner, though maybe the transposed vocal lines don’t fit his voice well.Presumably such changes are intended to bolster the relocating of the action from 16th century Germany to a contemporary USA, where Valentin is a prominent politician with a strong pro-life message. Marguerite’s aborting of her illegitimate baby replaces the infanticide of the original plot. The result is intermittently compelling but elsewhere unconvincing. Due to Valentin’s unusual prominence, nominal hero Faust feels relatively sidelined. Plastic surgery – or at least a nose-job – replaces his magical rejuvenation.The staging’s virtues are also hidden by the numerous screens required for the extensive use of video (the work of video artist Lillevan) throughout. Dictating the space available for live performers in various scenes, they generally get in the way. There’s a strong tendency, too, for the hyperactive moving images to distract from the action. This would have been a more cogent and involving show without them.Strong singing, though, from Peter Auty’s vital and lyrical Faust, Juanita Lascarro’s fluent Marguerite and especially from James Creswell’s star turn of a Mephistopheles, while Stuart Stratford’s conducting is distinguished.

A supply ship from Stromness arrives at a remote Outer Hebrides lighthouse to find it deserted – all three keepers vanished, but no sign of accident or disturbance. This true, unexplained occurrence is the basis for Peter Maxwell Davies’s chilling 1979 opera The Lighthouse, its music often angular and gritty but always accessible.The third of English Touring Opera’s autumn trio of contrasting and complementary chamber operas, this production is also the best – the success of Ted Huffman’s magnificently intense period setting heightened by Neil Irish’s lighthouse interior and Guy Hoare’s superbly atmospheric lighting. The three-man cast is outstanding – Adam Tunnicliffe, Nicholas Merryweather and Richard Mosley-Evans each fully committed and engrossing.Ostensibly part ghost tale, part detective mystery, in Maxwell Davies’s vivid telling the story becomes a disturbing psycho-drama. The 30-minute prologue sets the scene, the supply ship officers testifying their version of events. The equivocation of the agitated, unsettling music tells us all is not what it seems, however – and contradictions emerge in their stories. Post-interval, the dramatic reconstruction of the keepers’ last hours shows the terrible descent of the three men – their relief long overdue, surviving on stale oatcakes and a determination to “keep up appearances” – into paranoia and violent madness. The arrival of the supply ship heralds a grisly denouement.The claustrophobic mood is intensified with imaginative scoring, including intimate guitar and nerve-jangling xylophone, superbly rendered by 12 members of Aurora. Richard Baker’s assured conducting is grippingly driven.You will rarely experience a more compelling and affecting night at the opera than this. Don’t miss it.

573,Tosca review at Kings Head Theatre London,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2012/tosca-review-at-kings-head-theatre-london/,Tosca,Kings Head Theatre London,Tosca review at Kings Head Theatre London,,2012-10-10,Graham Rogers,"Three years after its Olivier award-winning production of La boheme, shoestring company OperaUpClose returns to Puccini for a make-over of Tosca. Director Adam Spreadbury-Maher’s concept (he also produced the new English version of the libretto) is smart and apt – transposing 19th century revolutionary Italy into East Berlin in 1989, just before the collapse of the Soviet regime. The power abuse enjoyed by corrupt official Scarpia, in an era when people routinely “disappeared”, feels shockingly real even two decades later.But the downsizing of the opera to fit the back room of the King’s Head pub is less successful than previous productions. A cast of four is not enough – ridiculously, poor Miles Horner (later a solid henchman) spends Act 1 constantly quick-changing between fugitive Angelotti and a “caretaker”.The production feels more short-changed orchestrally than others, too – the essence of Puccini’s sumptuous score lost with the radical down-paring for solo clarinet and cello, with musical director Elspeth Wilkes at the piano. The small-scale approach is most wanting in the epic Act 1 finale Te Deum, here reduced to a monologue.The singing is generally of a good standard, but consistently too loud for such a confined space. Edward Hughes is a muscular-sounding Cavaradossi, taking his high notes with impressive ease. Becca Marriott has the character and vocal stamina for Tosca, but her distended vowels make her difficult to understand.Yet, despite some shortcomings, the drama of this production is often powerfully compelling – particularly in the skin-crawling central act, thanks to committed performances from Marriott and James Harrison as a subtly villainous Scarpia.

There, surrounded by other ‘degenerate’ artists and intellectuals, he produced some remarkably life-affirming works – none more so than the hour-long chamber opera The Emperor of Atlantis.With its subversive plot concerning a megalomaniac leader bent on total war, it is surprising the authorities allowed it to get to the dress rehearsal before halting the production and transporting everyone involved – including Ullmann and librettist Peter Kein – to Auschwitz.Neglected for decades, the impressive and individual score – gritty serialism morphs seamlessly into bittersweet show tunes – is beginning to receive the recognition it deserves. James Conway’s new English Touring Opera production is minimal but powerful. The cast, led by Richard Mosley-Evans in the title role, is committed and engaging. Dark humour and memorable melodies provide relief, building to the tragic denouement. Ullmann’s Bach-like chorale, thanking Death for ultimate peace, is profoundly moving, its poignancy heightened here with a visual reminder of the composer’s atrocious fate.Inspired by this, the production opens with a Bach cantata in a beautiful re-orchestration by Iain Farrington for the same 12-piece band that performs the opera, through which the universality of Bach’s music shines gloriously. Conway’s light staging allows the apt conceit – four Jewish prisoners singing to the indolent Emperor and his acolytes – to speak strongly for itself.Conducted by Peter Selwyn, the members of Aurora Orchestra convey a genuine feel for the scores – a key factor in the success of this important production.

William Dazeley’s suave, cynical Giovanni pursues a double act with Alastair Miles’ lugubrious Leporello, who is often literally in the spotlight. Most of the principals wear the Victorian garb of high moral rectitude, but Claire Wild’s sexy Zerlina and her tall, teddy-boy boyfriend Masetto – strikingly sung by Oliver Dunn – bring the dynamic of their more upfront, demotic group along to revitalise the mix. The result is lively and entertaining – and all the more so because a sensible edition of the opera is used and conductor Tobias Ringborg keeps the score moving with such expertise.The singing is excellent, with Miles’ bel canto skills brought to bear on Mozart’s grumbling servant, alongside Meeta Raval’s passionate Donna Anna, Elizabeth Atherton’s flamboyant Elvira, Christopher Turner’s buttoned-up Ottavio and Michael Druiett’s Il Commendatore all providing conspicuous highlights along the way.

At any rate, the comedy of mummy’s boy Albert Herring’s alcohol-fuelled journey of self-discovery, following his coronation as May King by the puritanical village committee – no girl is judged virtuous enough – swiftly established itself as a favourite.Its chamber-proportions make it a good choice for small-scale companies like English Touring Opera, especially in intimate venues like the Linbury, and Christopher Rolls’s sensitive and fun new 1940s-set production captures its spirit well. Neil Irish’s simple sets, encased in a large lattice wood frame, create the right mood – from the stuffed pheasant and tiger rug adorning Lady Billows’s drawing room, to the crates of fruit in Herring’s shop – although the thick fog of smoke which engulfs the stage for much of the opera (presumably to enhance the lighting) is bizarre in indoor scenes. At least the Linbury smoke machines are inaudible.Sweet-voiced tenor Mark Wilde is ideally cast in the title role, equally adept at Herring’s initial repression as his subsequent endearing boisterousness. Martha Jones displays an attractive voice and personality as Nancy, the girl of Herring’s hopeless, suppressed affections. The cast of village stereotypes – prim school teacher, mild-mannered vicar, moustached constable – are well-acted and decently sung – most of the words are clear.Although not as taut as could be, the 13-piece band under the well-paced direction of Michael Rosewell conveys the sparkle and atmospheric qualities of Britten’s score.

In their choruses the paddling water nymphs appear as if from nowhere. Paule Constable’s deft lighting creates impact.Glyndebourne Tour music director Jakub Hrusa may not always match the dramatic atmosphere with orchestral colour but Mischa Schelomianski is assured as Vodnik (water goblin), as is Anne Mason singing the witch Jezibaba. Peter Berger is ardent as the Prince and Natasha Jouhl’s Rusalka gathers in vocal richness and character development. Eliana Pretorian makes an impression in the small role of the Kitchen Girl.

The result, unfortunately, does not match the success of previous Handel titles at this address – indeed, it scarcely works on any level other than the musical.Keegan-Dolan’s designers – Andrew Lieberman (sets) and Doey Luthi (costumes) – provide a modern ambience without any particular geographical signifiers, unless the realistic crocodile Caesar shoots in the head in the opening scene is meant to represent Egypt. If so, what the sedated and later dismembered giraffe is meant to be is anyone’s guess. There are a lot of guns and the occasional shooting – buckets of blood are poured over characters despatched along the way. Above all there is endless dancing, energetically executed by a ten-strong team and constantly upstaging the singers as they deliver Handel’s arias. Indeed, so sidelined are characterisation and narrative that the dancing becomes the chief visual interest. Handel’s opera, however, cannot survive such an approach and the evening teeters towards disaster.Some of the singers nevertheless make their mark. Despite a bad cold, Anna Christy gets all of Cleopatra’s notes, even if the production doesn’t allow her any star charisma. Lawrence Zazzo makes a Mitt Romney-like Caesar. Patricia Bardon excels as Pompey’s widow, Cornelia. Conductor Christian Curnyn keeps a steady hand on the tiller.

When this staging was launched in 2004/06, the designs by the late Stefanos Lazaridis (who died in 2010) led to some disappointment – unlike in the best of his work, the results often look cluttered and fussy, something unfortunately mirrored in Warner’s direction. The last half hour of Gotterdammerung is still a terrible mess. Elsewhere – including in parts of Die Walkure and much of Siegfried – Lazaridis’ visuals are pared down, allowing the narrative to come through to inescapably powerful effect.Warner knows the Ring’s wide range of possible meanings as well as anyone, but in trying to include so many – some of them pretty obscure – there’s a danger of losing clarity. Full of arcane references, the result sometimes feels like a Ring for Wagner-nerds rather than for those wanting to take in the bigger picture.But, as before, there are some exceptional individual performances and the bulk of the first cycle comes over well. Royal Opera music director Antonio Pappano avoids ponderousness by maintaining fast tempi and textural lightness. He also builds momentum steadily to the point where Siegfried, in particular, lifts off thrillingly into the air. Not all of the biggest moments, however, strike home with ideal grandeur.Bryn Terfel returns as Wotan, the linchpin of the cycle, offering for the first time with the company the Wanderer – the persona the character adopts in Siegfried. There are a few moments of vocal wear and roughness, a reminder that even for this protean bass-baritone this is an enormous sing – but in general his quality of tone and the detail of his interpretation remain extraordinary. His Wanderer is an outstanding achievement, an in-depth portrayal of a god riven by doubt and driven by a desire for his own and the world’s destruction.Susan Bullock’s game, energetic Brunnhilde – widely seen elsewhere over the years, but previously heard at Covent Garden only in the shape of one performance of Die Walkure – is perhaps caught a little late in the day for complete vocal success, but she’s bold and feisty, and paces herself intelligently, achieving a consistency in Gotterdammerung that overrides niggling doubts about quality of tone and secure high notes.Though lacking an ideal heldentenor quality higher up, Simon O’Neill makes an honourable Siegmund. Eva-Maria Westbroek repeats her engaged and movingly human Sieglinde. John Tomlinson’s Hunding is tireless, and together with his mesmerising Hagen in Gotterdammerung he makes a vital and entirely positive contribution to this Ring.In Das Rheingold, Wolfgang Koch’s Alberich sounds on the limited side, however vividly he acts the part. On the opening night of Siegfried, indisposition meant that he could only act the role while his compatriot Jochen Schmeckenbecher sang it from a music stand at the side of the stage. Koch was back, though, for Gotterdammerung, an eerie presence suspended in a boat hung from the flies, wheezing his last as he exhorts his son to keep faith with his eternally malign schemes.Making his Royal Opera debut as Siegfried, the German Stefan Vinke offers a convincing heldentenor, with all the notes and plenty of solid lyric heft. He’s also physically convincing as a ruthlessly determined young ruffian, with no real awareness of who he is and what is going on around him. He maintains this high standard throughout Gotterdammerung, his substantial, sheeny voice rising with aplomb to the near-impossible demands Wagner makes on his leading tenor. We’ll surely be seeing more of this exciting artist in the future.Those making their marks in secondary roles include Maria Radner’s beautifully sung Erda – though Warner’s decision to have Wotan kill her at the end of their scene in Siegfried is one of several bizarre directorial moments – and Eric Halfvarson’s Fafner, whose appearance as a head sticking out of the ground as he is dying remains one of the production’s most striking visual gestures. Sarah Connolly’s grand-scale Fricka easily quashes Terfel’s Wotan in their matrimonial dispute in Die Walkure. Rachel Willis-Sorensen confirms the promise of her recent Covent Garden debut as a Gutrune with an exceptionally beautiful lyric soprano. Peter Coleman-Wright is barely adequate in his two assumptions – Donner in Das Rheingold and Gunther in Gotterdammerung – but Gerhard Siegel’s Mime once again hits the spot in Das Rheingold and Siegfried.A Ring of mixed qualities, then, but at its best a fine one.

The opera itself, derived from a play by the French writer Georges Neveux and premiered in Prague in 1938, is not often performed, although ENO, in collaboration with the much-missed New Opera Company, presented it at this same address back in 1978. As on that occasion, Julietta leaves a mixed impression.The Czech Martinu, who spent large portions of his career in France and the US, is usually regarded as a minor master who wrote too much for his own good. Though his best known phase is characterised by the fashionable (especially in Paris) language of neo-classicism, Julietta mixes styles promiscuously, and no musical idea seems to last very long. Despite attractive and even inventive orchestral writing – given vital definition here by the company’s music director, Edward Gardner – not much of the opera sticks in the mind.In many ways the production works well in matching the circular, non-narrative progress of the piece. Antony McDonald’s clever designs focus on – of all things – an accordion (an instrument that makes a brief but notable appearance in the score). Memorable performances, too, from Peter Hoare as the nerdy Michel who falls in love with Julia Sporsen’s enigmatic Julietta – whom he meets, loses and then again searches for in a curious world where no one has any memories. With a stronger score, we’d be haunted by the drama’s strange fascination; as it is, it’s the music that proves forgettable.

The blue wigs, giant serpent, dancing bears and real performing birds continue to wow audiences although these are only part of the appeal. Bob Crowley’s architectural shapes and eclectic ‘Egyptian’ designs successfully define a world apart, often striking a deeper note than that favoured here by revival directors Ian Rutherford and James Bonas.Intent on making comedic play with their decidedly multi-national, mostly youthful cast, they do ensure that diction is impressive in the vocal numbers. Kathryn Lewek’s pint-sized Queen of Night has the technique for her big moments and a mid-Western take on the dialogue (not shared by Shawn Mathey’s transatlantic Tamino). Rhian Lois’s Papagena is maximally Welsh, whereas Adrian Thompson’s pantomimic Monostatos cannot be placed geographically. Robert Lloyd, a rare septuagenarian Sarastro, remains a noble presence for all that an oddly mangled quality can invade his vocal production and one feels him wanting to move things on in the graver mysteries of ActII.The best singing comes from Australians. Duncan Rock showcases his distinctive vocal timbre in a broad treatment that has him referring to Papagena as a ‘sheila’. Elena Xanthoudakis as Pamina is allowed to be subtler – her bright, shining timbre deployed with tact and sensitivity. Making his ENO debut, conductor Nicholas Collon imparts plenty of fizz to ActI after a remarkably assured account of the overture combining rhythmic buoyancy and lean string tone. That ActII droops a little may be Mozart’s fault but there could be more magic and finesse in the pit and on stage.

Both point to the background atmosphere in which the opera takes place but neither help develop the unfolding drama.At times, it employs the worst cliches of cod opera – nothing is said if it can’t be said twice and nothing is sung if it can’t be delivered with an overbearing intensity. In the interludes between singing, Yannis Thavoris’ set looks ravishing.The eight-strong cast do all that is asked of them, creating characters who do not develop and singing notes that do not illuminate, but doing so very well. Claire Booth’s Ellida, second wife to the curt, uptight Wangel (Mark Milhofer), rolls around pulling at her corset stays like a fish out of water, to help indicate that she is suffocating away from the open sea and her first love.Stephen Loges as the one-time tutor to Wangel’s elder daughter Boletta (Sarah Shorter), called back by Wangel as an old-friend of Ellida, looks suitably perturbed when his proposal of marriage to Boletta is rejected. Shorter, too, looks suitably askance at the proposal.There is something in here, struggling to get out. A discussion of love and necessity, the bartering of emotion for the means to live. But in the various plot lines and large cast, this tries to say too much and ends up saying nothing.

The strangers accept the old couple’s hospitality and, before leaving, reveal that they are in a mission to destroy two nearby towns for their lack of humanity.There’s no problem in the updating of the setting to modern times. A central room provides a calm and shaded oasis from the outside heat with a gnarled oak growing right into the room. To its left is Sarah’s tiny, basic kitchen. To the right is the reverse view of the main room.The performances are all there too, starting with the Orchestra of Scottish Opera conducted by Derek Clark, whose soundscape and clarity of tone help the understanding. Janis Kelly is bursting with spirit as Sarah, incredulous when the strangers announce she is pregnant. Grant Doyle is quite the humble host as Abraham – until the strangers announce their true intentions.As the strangers, Christopher Diffey, Adam Green and Eamonn Mulhall provide a real threat. If they are angels, then they are certainly of the avenging variety, minions of a unforgiving God. There is both power and intricacy in their singing.Yet, for all its fine presentation, strong performances and articulate construction, this fails to engage on an intellectual level.

Ruby Hughes’ slightly fraught, dreamy Ella sees an escape here, but Paul Curievici’s Stephen longs to take the frequent fast trains back up to London to conclude his business deals.It’s a tight telling of the tale, with Watkins’ music emphasising that in poetry – “it’s love, sex and death” – all is art. Ella’s impregnation by doomed poet Pascoe (Hakan Vramsmo), whose permanent room in the house is kept locked by lascivious landlady Susan (fabulously sung by Louise Winter), proves poetry’s fecundity over Stephen’s money-fuelled, forced coupling.Slightly overlong, but wracking up the intensity, Stuart MacRae and Louise Welsh’s Ghost Patrol is set in the bar of a military town after some future war. From the opening fight – expertly directed by Raymond Short – where bar owner Alasdair (James McOran-Campbell) discovers thief Sam (Nicholas Sharratt) was in his platoon when they were both in the army, there is a sense of foreboding.If McOran-Campbell and Sharratt quickly create a whole history of friendship and camaraderie between Alasdair and Sam, Jane Harrington as Alasdair’s girlfriend Vicki foretells the whole plot with one flaming glance at Sam. She creates assumptions which director Matthew Richardson then plays with and subverts to telling and, ultimately, heart-rending effect.A pair of mini operas that prove how satisfying and productive the Five:15 process has been.

This Don Giovanni is the first of three touring productions the company is touring this season.On first night the opening encounter of Don Giovanni with Donna Anna may have seemed a bit inert, but the Don’s vile act of whipping out his phone to snap himself with the dying Commendatore soon grabbed the attention. In fact this execrable behaviour felt at odds with this particular Don, sung by David Milner-Pearce. Despite the lothario’s standard shortcomings of misogynism and egocentricity – or even the drug-taking, standard in updated productions, as this one is – this was a jovial rather than hedonistic character, a scarf-wearing middle-class fop who wins his conquests more by charisma than machismo.Milner-Pearce’s vocal stamina stands up well and Yair Polishook, rich-toned and thin-framed, has as an attractive way of playing his recitatives as heightened speech. Within a comfortably secure cast, Matthew Tomko makes an impression as a resolute Commendatore, and Lisa Wilson is especially impressive as a Donna Anna capable of real vocal drama.The sets, based on naked female mannequins in blue-lit display cases, and other objets displayed on tall pedestals, help to mark out this particular Don as being of some distinction, but they feature ubiquitously.Tim Murray conducts a reduced orchestra that works hard but by its nature finds scaling of dynamics difficult, and Murray could certainly do more in the opera’s more intimate reaches.

One of nine different programmes presented over the course of the three-week event, this double bill consisting of two rarely performed one-acters is effectively staged by Nina Brazier.Bastien and Bastienne is a pretty but innocuous comedy composed by the 12-year-old Mozart, thought to have been written for a garden party at the Viennese home of Dr Mesmer, who practised magnetic cures widely credited in their day as efficacious. Mesmer may be referred to in the role of the magician Colas, with his parade of Latin tags and a nonsense spell aria, who brings together the two simple lovers after their row. John Savournin excels in a performance founded on a vital baritone and exhibiting considerable stage artistry. Soprano Grace Power charms as lovelorn Bastienne, with tenor David Menezes giving an aptly guilt-ridden account of naughty boy Bastien.But it’s the second half, the brilliant 1909 comedy Susanna’s Secret by the Italian composer Wolf-Ferrari, which really hits the spot. Susanna’s guilty secret – all too topical today – is that she smokes, a fact she conceals from her husband, Count Gil, who instead suspects a lover. Wolf-Ferrari’s clever, inventive score is skilfully realised on the piano by David Eaton, while soprano Georgia Ginsberg and baritone Christopher Jacklin embody the two central characters persuasively both vocally and dramatically. Reappearing is John Savournin, this time in the silent role of the servant Sante, whom he makes memorable.

So worrying about Les Naufrages’ four-hour running time seems a little priggish – and ultimately unnecessary, the light-hearted drama based on Jules Verne’s posthumous novel flies by.Lines between appearance and reality are blurred as soon as you reach the cavernous Lowland Hall near Edinburgh Airport. Only thin white lace separates the audience from the dressing rooms. Theatregoers can watch actors stick on fake moustaches and give each other pre-show pep talks… But how much of it is just for show?The devised English and French play (which translates as The Castaways of the Fol Espoir – Sunrises, and is presented with surtitles), first performed in 2010, gives you a backstage look at the action on stage too. A group of friends and colleagues perturbed – and then devastated – by the approach of World War One are making a silent film about an ill-fated boat trip to Australia via the Cape of Horn.The joy of Ariane Mnouchkine’s production lies in its massive scope and awe-inspiring attention to detail. The 33-strong cast dive around behind camerawoman Gabrielle decorating the scene with snow, smoke, wind, backdrops, spotlights, classical music and some wonderfully over-the-top acting – particularly from Eve Doe-Bruce as Mr Felix.Does it justify the four-hour running time? Probably not. The politics-heavy second half (it’s all about humanity, guys) does begin to drag. However, by the time you reach the morale-boosting final scene you will still find yourself marvelling at how the French theatre company made the hours disappear.

She is a chameleon, able to shift from masculine to feminine with the turning of a cheek – hard granite eyes melting into innocent pools. Part spoken and part sung, her low vocal rhythms transform Shakespeare’s poem into an invocation – it is as though long dead spirits are singing.The Rape of Lucrece – originally told by Livy, then Ovid and here through an Elizabethan gaze – is a story of stolen female honour historically written by men to be read by men. Here it is resplendently told by a woman and the act of physical violation is suddenly very real.On hearing of Lucrece’s famed chastity, Tarquin beseeches entry into her house and rapes her. To uphold her virtue she commits suicide.As the vessel for this violent poetry the compelling O’Sullivan is an inspired choice. She speaks with a natural understanding of Shakespeare’s timbre, fluidly turning his verses into lyrics. Her singing makes each note a pin prick that lets the emotion seep out of this passionate text.The haunting compositions, created with musical partner Feargal Murray, avoid monotony but are strangely dirge-like. Whether in the hardening of Tarquin’s resolve or Lucrece’s angry mourning, they are a lament.Away from O’Sullivan things are more fudged. Elizabeth Freestone’s staging feels under-baked and the proscenium frame does little to bring this audience closer to a performer who is constantly reaching out. But though frustrating, neither dampens O’Sullivan’s luminosity or power.

Butterfly) Hwang. It arrives belatedly now, a highlight of the sixth season of London’s self-styled hippest opera festival, currently located in an acoustically permeable circus tent.The noises off are most damaging in the first piece, a mythic tale of dreams, fantasies and pregnant pauses in which an ageing samurai seeks fulfilment with a lonely and mysterious woman of the forests. If Glass’s hardcore admirers have been dismayed by the softening of temper evident in recent scores, the Silk Road ensemble deployed here – with pipa, flute doubling shakuhachi, violin, cello and exotic percussion – further dilutes the brand. Locating the action geographically and psychologically rather than determining its flow, the music plays second fiddle to an unremittingly linear text whose language, at times prosaic, can be resonant and affecting too. The companion piece, Hotel of Dreams, is more reliant on Glass’s characteristic repeating patterns. Its complementary tragi-comic take on thwarted intimacy is expressed through the dialogue of a metropolitan writer and a brothel-keeper. Duets are eschewed throughout.Helped by unfussy direction and design, including some discreetly effective video work by Ian Galloway, all four protagonists are first rate and only as ‘Japanese’ as the plot dictates. The young Catherine May shows great promise in the difficult (because inscrutable) role of Hanako while Geraldine McGreevy’s commanding performance as Michiko, the madam with her own history of longing and loss, is unmissable.

Yet taken as a whole this is a wildly ambitious project whose staging by Graham Vick and his vast and committed Birmingham forces is a hugely impressive achievement.Stockhausen, who died in 2007, was one of the most influential creative figures of his time, even if his wackier ideas were derided by some. The archetypal figures of Michael, Lucifer and Eve reappear throughout Light, whose subject-matter is played out on a cosmic level that nevertheless takes in the childishly comic. Vick’s production moves through the vast interiors of the Argyle Warehouse that the company has made its regular performing space. Highlights include the virtuosic choral singing of Ex Cathedra in the World Parliament scene, another small orchestra suspended over the heads of the audience in Orchestra Finalists, and the wildly surreal yet often magically beautiful climax of the Michaelion, where Paul Brown’s designs include a camel that defecates planets.

The orchestra plays ravishingly, and it is extra special to experience the only opera Wagner composed specifically for this venue here. Heading a vocally average cast is Burkhard Fritz’s well-rounded Parsifal and Kwangchul Youn’s resonant Gurnemanz, but the shrieked top notes of Susan Maclean’s Kundry leave much to be desired.The real Wahnfried, home to the Wagner family for most of the last century and opened to the public in the 1970s, is currently closed for restoration – so it is good to have it preserved on stage while this engrossing and cathartic production lasts.

The title of the first, L’heure espagnole, is almost impossible to translate. It’s a sex comedy, set in the shop of a Spanish clock maker whose wife sends him off to wind up the municipal clocks while she receives her various lovers – eventually ending up with the hunky muleteer Ramiro, who merely came in to have his watch mended.In Laurent Pelly’s naughty staging to Caroline Ginet and Florence Evrard’s clever, hyperactive set, Ramiro’s constant carrying of the clocks containing Concepcion’s lovers provides the farcical element at the centre of the piece, which Ravel clothes with his highly sophisticated score, beautifully presented here by the London Philharmonic under conductor Kazushi Ono. Top-notch performances such as Stephanie d’Oustrac’s flamboyantly voracious Concepcion, Alek Shrader’s hippy poet Gonzalve, Paul Gay’s prosperous Don Inigo and Elliot Madore’s credibly dumb but muscularly gifted Ramiro make this an unalloyed treat.After the interval comes L’enfant et les sortileges, a magical piece about a naughty and destructive child who vandalises his room and hurts the animals in the garden until they are saved by a realisation of their suffering. Khatouna Gadelia looks suitably tiny against Barbara di Limburg’s giant table and chair set, while brilliant visual ideas come thick and fast as the furniture and creatures rise up to berate him for his cruelty. Many individual performances impress with their wit and charm, and though Ono’s conducting needs a touch more momentum it scarcely detracts from an evening of genuine enchantment.

What they are driving at is anyone’s guess. In this case Baumgarten is possibly reflecting the hero Tannhauser’s own experiment with carnal excess.Opera should challenge and provoke. When they were new, Wagner’s music dramas were shockingly avant-guarde, and they can still be today – but the current trend for layering additional, often contradictory, notions over the composer’s own is counter-productive. Joep van Lieshout’s money-no-object set – a vast multi-floored industrial plant construction and caged Venusberg love-grotto which rises from the ground – is undeniably impressive, but it is impossible to take any production seriously that features dancing sperms.Thankfully, the solid and inspiring presence of peerless Wagnerian Christian Thielemann in the pit ensures high musical values, as does the excellent cast – streets ahead of any other at Bayreuth this year. The top accolade goes to Camilla Nylund, whose Elisabeth has an ideal balance of power tempered with creamy beauty. Michelle Breedt’s Venus is similarly strong, as is Michael Nagy’s Wolfram – his exquisite O! Du mien holder is a highlight. Torsten Kurl’s Tannhauser has an easy fluency, and each of the smaller roles is well delivered. With the festival chorus and orchestra on majestic form, the music – Wagner’s most conventionally tuneful – is frequently spine-tingling, resounding splendidly in the marvellous Festspielhaus acoustic – a true wonder of the modern world.

Margery (sung by Jennifer France) has left Hewson (Grant Doyle) for another man and her letter to her former husband stirs up intense feelings of loss and revenge. Charlotte Bray’s lightly and deftly scored ensemble complements her sensitive and clear vocal writing. Grant Doyle is rich-toned and dramatically compelling as the reliable, stoical Hewson, and Jennifer France is beautifully patronising of him. Alice Farnham conducts with assurance.Reinventing Greek myths can be tricky, which Hera’s List (words and music by Eve Harrison) only seems to underline. Sam Lea is convincing as Ashdon, the destitute mortal to whom the goddess Hera despatches a series of goddesses to win his heart and cheer his spirits. If the scenario needs tightening, the text is also weak, and comic elements often fall flat (plus there’s a pretty excruciating zombie-style dance). Musically, though, Harrison presents impressive instrumental colours and dramatic pacing.On its own terms the music (by Toby Young) for The Daisy Chain is less original, a touch more commercial-sounding, yet it’s well crafted and the production overall is strongly affective. Through the enquiries of a Therapist, we are introduced to the apparently delusional Daisy (she has married a serially abusive prince and a Creature has demanded her first-born in exchange for saving her life). Elizabeth Graham is a natural as the bookish, at first unbelieving, Therapist and Joanna Foote stands out vocally as the Creature, whose lyrical lullaby to her newly acquired baby is a highlight of the piece.

Its Crusade-era setting provides an epic fantasy backdrop that should be a gift to stage directors. But not so at the Bayreuth Festival, which currently places more store in contrived subversive concepts.Wagner’s operas are not renowned for their humour. Attempts at inserting any usually feel like send-ups – which is exactly the case with the (magnificent-voiced) chorus of lab rats and mice which dominate Hans Neuenfels’s 2010 production, back for a third year. The silly rodent antics are a shame, because otherwise the clinical production can be sensitive to the drama, making some pertinent observations.Fortunately, the music reigns supreme. Conductor Andris Nelsons coaxes some golden legato from the Festival Orchestra strings and, even though he could inject more animation into the long recitative passages, he ensures elating climaxes – ringing out with crystal clarity in the phenomenal Festpielhaus acoustic.Klaus Florian Vogt is a powerful, fresh-voiced hero. Wilhelm Schwinghammer brings authoratitive grativas to King Henry, while Annette Dasch’s Elsa is sensitive if a shade retiring. Despite his unfocused tone, Thomas J Mayer is a suitably villainous Telramund – tall, long hair, dastardly beard. Susan Maclean brings the Lady Macbeth-like Ortrud full-bloodedly to life, but her shrill upper register is not beautiful. It is not a vintage cast but there are few major disappointments, so Wagner’s music shines through the patchy production.

Everything about the unique theatre, which Wagner built solely to play his operas, is designed to focus attention on the stage – there are no architectural “distractions”, even the orchestra is hidden away. Once the audience is seated in long, tightly-packed rows, the lights are dimmed to near-darkness and the exits are locked with ominous clunks so that nothing can disturb the total-immersion in music and drama.No Wagner opera potentially benefits more from this claustrophobic experience than his extreme exploration of annihilating passion, Tristan und Isolde. Christoph Marthaler’s seven year-old, mid-20th century-set production tries its hardest to subvert Wagner’s all-consuming ecstasy with perverse anti-romantic sterility – preposterously, the lovers stand coldly apart through most of their epic Act 2 duet – but, thanks to the sterling efforts of stalwart Bayreuth conductor Peter Schneider, the musical world at least is transcendentally rapturous.Neither of the two leads possesses a stunning voice, but both have the crucial stamina required to carry off the demanding roles. Despite her frumpy appearance (blame designer Anna Viebrock), Irene Theorin’s soprano has a youthful bloom which, with her fiery heft, ensures a compelling portrayal of Isolde climaxing in an exhilarating Liebestod. Robert Dean Smith is often no match for the mighty orchestra, but he communicates well – Tristan’s death scene is a highlight. The supporting cast is excellent.The oldest production at Bayreuth in 2012, this is the last outing for Marthaler’s Tristan. Hopefully the festival’s next production will better represent the composer’s intentions, but don’t hold your breath – current house style seems to favour contrived concepts over fidelity.

The big event for 2012, a new production of The Flying Dutchman, made headlines a week before opening night when Russian baritone Evgeny Nikitin pulled out of the title role after images of his swastika-like body tattoos surfaced on German television. Presiding over their fourth season, festival managers Eva Wagner-Pasquier and Katharina Wagner (half-sisters, both great-granddaughters of the composer) are evidently anxious to avoid any association with its murky Nazi past, and the production itself – the only new one this year – is an uncontroversial affair directed by 30-year old Bayreuth newcomer Jan Philipp Gloger.Wagner’s Dutchman is eternally doomed to roam the seas. Most of the action in Gloger’s land-bound world takes place in a factory warehouse, but there are oceanic resonances in the pulsing lights of the vast Tron-inspired computer chips that dominate Act I. Heading a strong cast, Samuel Youn’s Dutchman – reimagined as a traveling businessman with carry-on suitcase – has presence but lacks line in the lyrical duets. Adrianne Pieczonka is in glorious voice as Senta, the “individual” personality in a crowd of automaton factory girls. The 150-strong chorus makes a phenomenally lusty sound, but the stars are the tireless players of the magnificent orchestra – utterly thrilling in the magical Festpielhaus acoustic – and peerless Wagnerite conductor Christian Thielemann.The unbroken performance span (Wagner’s professed preference) means an uncomfortably long sit in the cramped Festpielhaus seats but, despite audience boos, Gloger’s production is largely successful. The relevance of the concept is ultimately less important than his vivid and harmonious representation of the music’s drama.

Though slimmed down chorally and orchestrally, Handel’s rarely performed oratorio, staged with keen focus by Pia Furtado, comes over with tremendous power in this exquisite space.The story is taken from a book in the Apocrypha, in which the chaste Susanna is approached with lascivious intent (and in this production raped) by the two lustful Elders, who turn the situation around and hypocritically accuse her of adultery – only the intervention of the young prophet Daniel saves her from execution.Furtado’s staging takes the characters and situations seriously and explores them in a visualisation whose detail – dramatic, vocal and musical – is inescapable in this tiny auditorium. A marvellous young cast presents a collection of vivid portrayals, sung with scrupulous artistry and finely accompanied here by the Orchestra of the Early Opera Company under the expert baton of Christian Curnyn.In Georgia Lowe’s designs, the hothouse pressure of an intensely religious community is strikingly conveyed. Ciara Hendrick’s Susanna has a quiet authority that holds her character together throughout her severe trial. John McMunn and Simon Robinson form the memorable duo of wicked Elders. A counter-tenor of remarkable promise, Christopher Lowrey sings the role of Susanna’s largely absent husband, Joacim, with mellifluous warmth. Sam Evans makes something positive out of Susanna’s father, Chelsias. Daisy Brown brings presence and spark to Daniel’s appearances, leading the drama to a conclusion whose inevitable element of moral unease Furtado handles with sensitivity and intelligence.

The form itself – a Restoration speciality – sounds unwieldy when described. Here you have a substantial but anonymously altered adaptation of Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, vividly presented by a full company of actors. Then, at the end of each act, masques are added in, with songs, dances and choruses aplenty in each. It’s long, but the momentum does not falter over the evening.Purcell’s score is a collection of memorable musical moments covering the subjects explored in each masque – one for sleep, another for seduction, another for marriage, and so on. With individual songs to suit each mood, from desperate sorrow to rambunctious comedy and all shades in between, the singers do a wonderful job of articulating the text and the composer’s immediately appealing notes.A further group of dancers trip the complex and varied steps devised by Kim Brandstrup for the many characters who pop up along the way. A sudden outburst of rabbits mating in innumerable unlikely positions brings the house down.Yet the play moves effortlessly into music and dance and then back again – singers act or dance, actors sing, and the musicians of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment deliver the score with striking character under the baton of Laurence Cummings.That’s scarcely even to mention the wonderful contribution from the actors, led by Christopher Benjamin’s irrepressible Bottom.

It seems they are intent on creating a new genre – anthropomorphic opera.Part of the London 2012 Festival, this floating barge-based event is part of the mayor’s Secrets – Hidden London season and will dock in a variety of locations throughout July.Edward Lear’s poem provides the starting point for a work that fills in the lead-up to the eponymous couple’s elopement by exposing the difficulties of a trans-species relationship, while sharpening up the political aspects of the tale.Perched on top of an enormous book, the Owl (Peter Willcock) watches as a trio of pert felines opens another giant book to reveal a pop-up set. Smitten by the kitten of his dreams, the Owl attempts to woo Pussycat (Claire Wild) through song. As a prequel to the events of the poem, the story follows the early stages of the romance to explain why the unlikely couple were forced to sail away to “the land where the Bong tree grows”.After a slow start, in which Dudley’s recitative seems rather jarring and forced, the music and the action become more integrated, and the lyrics from the small cast – several doubling roles – are clear and bright. Jones’ libretto manages to insinuate modish issues into the piece with deceptive ease. And the lack of child-friendly melodies is successfully masked by the performance concepts, which include a pair of handbag-wielding Mary Whitehouse cats from the “League of Feline Decency”, a Turkey Elvis impersonator waiting for the first couple to arrive at his wedding chapel and a Bong tree – complete with gong – who yearns to see the world but can’t because he is rooted to the spot.The production ends as the poem begins, with the strangely touching sight of the Owl and the Pussycat stepping off the barge into a pea-green boat, rowing up the canal and sailing out of sight.Some kids might be disappointed at the absence of the silvery moon at the end of the show, but not even the Mayor of London can control everything.

Here we seem to be between the wars as the action begins in a cottage hospital for recovering veterans. Sir John Falstaff – a war hero gone to seed? – holds court in a surreal metroland of Tudorbethan architecture and village tea parties where convention rules, everyone keeps busy and the straitlaced vicar and his WI wife (Mr Ford and Alice) are the acme of society. But we are also shown the passionate hinterland beneath the respectable veneer. The clever model-village set by Nicky Shaw, all inglenooks and chintz before the interval, manages also to evoke an older, primal England – the Windsor Forest scene is achieved very simply by Shaw and lighting designer Mark Jonathan.Olafur Sigurdarson, on resplendent vocal form with a fine line in adroit physical comedy, is fully equal to the demands of the title role. And with George von Bergen a compelling Ford, their Act II interaction is a real highlight. The merry wives make an effective comic unit, with Carole Wilson’s below-stairs Quickly especially well observed.Conductor Peter Robinson obtains the essential continuity and drive from the City of London Sinfonia. The sound can turn shouty – there’s no pit at Holland Park – but special moments like the diaphanous fairy music of the last act are achieved with wonderful finesse.Falstaff is one of a handful of operas one wishes were longer than their allotted span.

Tchaikovsky’s opera is performed here by an entirely Anglophone cast, yet it is sung in Russian. With some good translations available, the show would be more communicative in English, but there are other issues preventing it from making its full impact.One is Daniel Slater’s misguided production. Moving the period forward to the last days of Tsarist rule, it shows the peasants on Madam Larina’s estate in rebellious mode – the Russian Revolution has clearly taken place between Acts II and III. Yet these weighty issues have no place in a piece that is unconcerned with matters of political change, they merely obscure the central narrative, which focuses entirely on personal relationships. As it is, the latter are poorly handled.Add in some lukewarm conducting from Alexander Polianichko and it’s not surprising that this evening never really gets off the ground. Anna Leese struggles with the hefty demands of Tatyana, and her childish manner fails to develop. Peter Auty has more success with Lensky, especially in his finely sung account of the famous aria in the duel scene, and similarly, Graeme Broadbent’s dignified Prince Gremin presents a moving version of his solo in the final act. Mark Stone has the wherewithal to deliver an exceptional Onegin, but he too is hampered by the staging. In better circumstances, many of the cast could win through. Here, they have too much stacked against them.

From the moment Antonio Pappano launches the overwhelming storm, you know you’re in for a special evening – and so it proves.The precision and sweep of the orchestral playing and choral singing are outstanding. One example must suffice – there’s a notoriously perilous solo passage for the double basses on Otello’s entrance in the last act, which is almost always disastrously tuned – here, for once, it is impeccably played.The cast is strong throughout and would be hard to equal today. Latvian tenor Aleksandrs Antonenko has made Verdi’s Moor – a role that plenty of big-voiced tenors shy away from – his own, and triumphs here in a reading that makes light of its fabled difficulties. A rare but welcome visitor to Covent Garden, Anja Harteros sings Desdemona with a lyric soprano tone that is without flaw – again, there is probably no-one currently able to touch her performance. Lucio Gallo’s Iago is more of a known quantity, but his varied, iron-tongued vocalism and subtle and complex acting make his a performance for the annals.Strong support comes from Hanna Hipp’s concerned Emilia, Brindley Sherratt’s noble Lodovico and Ji Hyun Kim’s pliant Roderigo.Elijah Moshinsky’s 1987 staging, however, looks its age, even if its handsome Veronese-like stage pictures are beautifully created and the whole show, from a dramatic point of view, feels more than adequately freshened up (by the director himself).

It’s a major company challenge, brought off here with a combination of great voices, fine acting, vital choreography and sheer heart.Christine Crouse’s lively and emotionally searching production moves the setting from 1920s Catfish Row, Charleston, to Soweto in the 1970s. It proves a good match, the deprivation of an oppressed community finding apt expression in DuBose Heyward’s and Ira Gershwin’s libretto and brother George’s magnificent score. Albert Horne conducts the Orchestra of Welsh National Opera, who punch it out from the pit with panache; exciting singing, too, from Cape Town Opera’s intensely powerful chorus. Though there’s a danger in turning too many pieces into production numbers, given the sheer physical commitment of the entire cast to Sibonakaliso Ndaba’s live-affirming choreography, one can hardly complain.All of the principals on the first night were excellent and some of them unforgettably good. Nonhlanhla Yende’s high-flying soprano charts, to moving effect, Bess’s zigzagging moral journey. Victor Ryan Robertson slinks and slithers about the stage as a dangerously magnetic Sportin’ Life. Ntobeko Rwanqa’s grand stature and equally grand baritone command the stage as an arrogantly menacing Crown.Xolela Sixaba’s performance as the disabled hero is a tremendous achievement, acted with dignity and heart-stopping humanity. His super-enriched bass-baritone is superb as an instrument and deployed with indelible eloquence. He’s the lynchpin of a production that fully justifies its composer’s hope that Porgy would take its place next to Carmen and Die Meistersinger.

Dramatically, both stem from the fairy tale tradition. Director Stephen Lawless and designer Russell Craig observe these origins in stagings that rework the pieces in later settings.In its original medieval garb, the post-Wagnerian Maiden in the Tower described a young woman imprisoned by a bailiff but eventually freed by the castle’s chatelaine. Lawless moves it to a children’s nursery around the time of composition, where the birthday of the bad bailiff’s son is being celebrated and the chatelaine becomes his governess. In its strange and disturbing way, the staging exerts its own fascination. Kate Ladner is striking as the maiden, Richard Berkeley-Steele a little tremulous as her lover (and not visually at his best in a sailor-suit), and Owen Gilhooly properly unpleasant as the bullying brat.Gilhooly then swaps to being the heroic rescuer, Prince Ivan, in Rimsky-Korsakov’s opera, releasing the princess from the clutches of the evil wizard and his cold-hearted daughter with the help of the storm wind. The original is part political allegory, part celebration of the triumph of spring over winter. Once again Lawless’s pointed reworking, in a fantastical mode that borders on expressionism, provides a valid reimagining. Strong performances here from Robert Poulton’s grand-scale storm wind and Emma Selway, seductive as Kashchei’s daughter. Conductor Stuart Stratford secures exceptional musical performances, and both operas prove significant rediscoveries.

Musically, the result is a rare treat. Less well known than it deserves to be, Intermezzo is notable for its sumptuous orchestral interludes, which Barlow delivers with swaggering brilliance. The Northern Chamber Orchestra plays marvellously for him.It’s a triumph, too, for the central figures in the cast, especially Janis Kelly, who carries the show as Christine, Strauss’s own semi-autobiographical depiction of his seriously difficult but ultimately lovable wife. Her nuclear-like reaction on reading a letter apparently intended for her husband written by a dubious female provides the lynchpin of the plot. Also germane to proceedings is her crush on a young Baron she (literally) collides with when out tobogganing.The ever resourceful Kelly is something of a wonder in this huge assignment: vocally secure and dramatically alert to every passing possibility of the text. Stephen Gadd supports her finely as the more phlegmatic Strauss, while Andrew Kennedy excels as the young man on the make. Secondary performers all make their mark in Stephen Unwin’s perceptive production.Neatly presented though Paul Wills’ period designs are (the work premiered in 1924), occasionally the needs of the scenario and the exciting musical build-ups provided by Strauss lead one to expect something more lavish when the curtain rises on a new scene. But the piece proves vastly entertaining in Andrew Porter’s translation, and Buxton regulars will not be disappointed.

But in recent decades a fashion has developed for trying to give them the full operatic treatment. The results are rarely successful.Frederic Wake-Walker’s self-designed production of Jephtha for the Buxton Festival hits a number of buffers. Visually, it’s simple to the point of meagreness, with not much more than a few chairs and a music stand as props, and the chorus dressed in black, with vast ruffs around their necks and their hair hidden under caps. Who or what they are meant to be is unclear. The same goes, unfortunately, for the rest of the cast.The Old Testament story tells how the warrior leader Jephtha vows to sacrifice the first thing he sees upon his return if Jehovah grants him victory against the Ammonites. The victim turns out, inevitably, to be his own daughter, Iphis.The principals move backwards and forwards between representing the Biblical characters and merely acting as singers performing the oratorio in concert. There are moments of sharp definition – Iphis and her beloved Hamor lamenting the perpetual virginity to which her sacrificial sentence is eventually commuted at the close – but not enough to redeem a puzzlingly obscure piece of theatre.Musical standards, however, are more than presentable under Baroque specialist conductor Harry Christophers. Of the principals, Susan Bickley is excellent as Jephtha’s wife, Storge; Gillian Keith neat and charming as Iphis; and James Gilchrist determined if a bit overparted as Jephtha.

The festival began with this piece back in 1934, and the same work inaugurated the new theatre exactly 60 years later. Reaching its 486th performance by the company on the first night of Michael Grandage’s new production, Mozart’s most popular comedy looks set to have a good future at this address.Grandage and his designer Christopher Oram gave Glyndebourne a triumphant Billy Budd two years ago, and return to stage this local speciality with verve and imagination. The period is the 1960s, the setting a grand Andalusian house inflected with Moorish architecture. The handsome sets work perfectly for the action and the singers delivering it.Detailed dramatic performances focus attention anew on familiar characters and situations often far less expertly realised. The complex interplay of emotional and sexual tensions within and between the inhabitants of the Almaviva household is flawlessly conveyed.Standout performances come from Isabel Leonard’s Cherubino, sung with individual tone and musical freshness, Vito Priante’s practical but insecure Figaro, Alan Oke’s lounge-lizard of a Basilio, Sally Matthews’s immaculately sung Countess and Andrew Shore’s know-it-all Bartolo. Lydia Teuscher’s wary Susanna, Audun Iversen’s moody, sexually frustrated Count and Ann Murray’s deeply human Marcellina add to the richness of the picture.Yet curiously, even though Robin Ticciati conducts a period-instrument band – the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment – conscientiously, there are no vocal decorations to be heard.

Co-creator of the work is Rufus Norris, who directs this adapted version of the original production. Dr Dee, here played by Paul Hilton, is no longer a silent character.Though a comparison with the Faust legend is made in a programme note, the piece has few intellectual pretensions and is more realistically viewed as an entertaining biographical pageant. Even on that level, it’s not easy to keep a clear grasp on the narrative.Musically, the evening centres on Albarn himself, singing his songs to the accompaniment of a small, varied ensemble, which despite the much dwelled-upon Englishness of the theme (the show opens with a parade of famous English men and women) features prominently the leading Nigerian drummer Tony Allen and the Malian kora player Mamadou Diabate.The more obviously ‘operatic’ sections go less well, partly because Albarn’s mix-and-match style never quite integrates obvious derivations from plainsong, Carl Orff, Philip Glass and others into something coherent or dramatically effective. Where the show reveals considerable flair is in the visuals, with Paul Atkinson’s sets, Katrina Lindsay’s costumes and Lysander Ashton’s videos forming an intriguing and often magical experience for the eyes.

The first part of the evening, dealing with the fall of Troy, is thrilling music theatre. In the second part, however, when we move on to the section dealing with the Trojans in Carthage, the show loses distinction and coherence.There’s much to admire up to the first interval. Es Devlin’s mighty set offers a gigantic metallic city wall and a monumental Trojan horse, made up of discarded weaponry. Visual references are made, especially in Moritz Junge’s handsome costumes, to the period of the Second French Empire, whose hubris and folly led up to the defeat and destruction of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and the Paris Commune of 1871. (Berlioz had composed his largest work – which was never performed complete during his lifetime – between 1856 and 1858.) Anna Caterina Antonacci bestrides the stage with superb engagement as Cassandra, doomed to foretell the downfall of her city but unable to convince its citizens of imminent danger; her passionate singing and acting provide the evening’s finest single performance, but both staging and music-making reach considerable general heights as disaster overtakes Troy.Later on the design falters. The North African milieu is suggested in bright costumes and with a vast, layered cityscape of warm Mediterranean colour, but that’s more or less it for the last three acts. When a drop curtain comes down for Dido’s grand scene of farewell, it looks odd; one expects it to rise to reveal something eminently striking for the final tableau. Instead, Dido’s funeral pyre is meagre and there’s a curious reappearance of the Trojan Horse in altered, semi-human form. Quite what this is intended to convey is uncertain.Other mistakes are made. A lengthy ballet sequence in Act IV is dully choreographed by Andrew George, and could be dropped altogether. The more important Royal Hunt and Storm is surprisingly poorly staged. Visual momentum and stagecraft both lose impetus.Individual performances provide a partial salvation, though Royal Opera regular Eva-Maria Westbroek scarcely seizes on the regal potential of Dido, ably supported though she is by Hanna Hipp as her sister Anna and by Brindley Sherratt as her chief minister, Narbal.To the American Bryan Hymel falls the unenviable task of replacing everyone’s favourite tenor, Jonas Kaufmann, the originally announced Aeneas. He acquits himself more than creditably, his tone bold and free, his high notes nicely placed and his manner sufficiently heroic to convince.Antonio Pappano conducts a secure performance, but even here some electricity is missing. Berlioz’s style is difficult to master, and despite some impressive work from orchestra and chorus the essential spirit of this grandiose masterpiece proves elusive.

It’s an interesting piece, not least because it postdates by a few months Gluck’s most famous opera, Orfeo ed Euridice, in which his historically important reform of opera was first put into practice. This work specially composed for the opening of a new theatre shows him returning to old-style opera seria.It consists of a succession of lengthy arias telling a story from ancient Roman history, in which the Etruscans under Porsenna besiege Rome and hold the young Roman woman Clelia as hostage. Her triumph consists in withstanding the amorous attacks of the duplicitous Tarquinio and remaining faithful to her heroic Roman beloved, Orazio.Old-fashioned the style maybe, but the score is lavishly composed and many of the individual arias are memorable. They demand high-powered singing, though, of a standard only intermittently reached here. Two mezzos, Mary-Ellen Nesi as Orazio and Irini Karaianni as Tarquinio, both make an appreciable mark. Vassilis Kavayas struggles honourably through the tenor role of Porsenna. Helene Le Corre makes a more than decent stab as Clelia. A late replacement, Lito Messini, stands in as Larissa, and makes the odd slip.The best thing about the evening is the excellent playing of the City of London Sinfonia under Giuseppe Sigismondi de Risio. The worst is Nigel Lowery’s self-designed staging, silly and pretentious by turns and occasionally both.

The short one-acter Zanetto, premiered in 1896 by students at the Pesaro Conservatory where its by then world-famous composer was director. It’s a slight two-hander, not without some musical charm, but the scenario is thin. Silvia, a courtesan living outside Florence, receives a surprise visit from an innocent young man who has heard of her and is looking for her. Falling in love with him but aware of her compromised life, she pretends to be someone else, and regretfully sends him away, his innocence preserved. Once seen, it’s quickly forgotten, lacking the stronger musical and dramatic profile of the composer’s best works. Martin Lloyd-Evans’s updated staging is unable to make it seem more viable than it is, though Janice Watson’s Silvia is pleasing and Patricia Orr’s Zanetto charming.After the interval, Puccini’s Gianni Schicchi goes well after a false start – an overextended dumb show as Buoso Donati’s relatives crowd round the dying man – but then Lloyd-Evans’s staging works a treat. It is well served by Anna Patalong’s appealingly sung Lauretta, Jung Soo Yun’s buoyant Rinuccio, and with Carole Wilson once again stealing scenes as Zita. Alan Opie’s Schicchi is perfectly judged from start to finish. Manlio Benzi’s conducting could do with a shade more consistency in its impetus, but the cast is strong and this supremely clever comedy once again hits the spot.

Whereas Grandage went for historical realism, David Alden and his team – Paul Steinberg for sets, Constance Hoffman for costumes and lighting designer Adam Silverman – present a more generic vision, not defining any specific period but suggesting the early Soviet era. Nor are nautical images prominent; the overall look is semi-abstract but varied and resonant. The result, over which Alden lightly dusts a coating of expressionist gestures, opens the work up, allowing its metaphysical resonances to shine through.The cast, which brings together many of the UK’s finest male operatic performers on the same stage, is strikingly good. Kim Begley’s Captain Vere is piercingly sung and acted with a consciousness of the character’s complex moral make-up and ultimate failure to do the right thing. Benedict Nelson offers a candid, beautifully sung Billy Budd. In its awareness of the pain at the heart of the darkest of operatic villains, Matthew Rose’s Claggart is a tremendous achievement – perhaps the finest thing this gifted bass has yet done. Add in exceptional standouts from Nicky Spence as an abject novice, Jonathan Summers’s authoritative Redburn and Daniel Norman’s pathetic Squeak, and the ship’s complement of excellence is full.ENO’s orchestra and expanded chorus are on wonderful form under conductor Edward Gardner, the brass section enjoying a heroic evening, and Gardner charts with expertise the rise and fall of Britten’s great climactic waves of sound in an immaculately paced account. It’s a great evening and an unmissable realisation of a masterpiece.

Sams has translated the piece anew, keeping faith with Offenbach’s notes and penning many witty lines; it makes excellent sense to play this lightweight piece containing plenteous dialogue in English. He also directs the pacy, good-natured staging, attractively designed by Francis O’Connor, which hits all available spots smack in the centre.The plot concerns a Peruvian street singer, whose name – La Perichole – translates roughly (and rudely) as ‘half-breed bitch’, and her boyfriend Piquillo. Neither of them has the money to marry, so she goes to earn some as the live-in favourite of the Spanish viceroy – a role played with manic brilliance by Geoffrey Dolton. There’s a dark core to the piece about the respective power of the rich and the poor, scarcely disguised by the numerous delights of the score, which is among Offenbach’s best. Number after number displays the composer’s ingenuity, and also his legacy to Gilbert and Sullivan. David Parry conducts with impeccable vitality.At the centre are two first-rate performances from the ingenue leads, Naomi O’Connell’s Perichole and Robert Murray’s Piquillo. Both of them sing with grace and style, she suitably sharp-witted and streetwise; he – something of a James Corden lookalike in a rumbustious comic performance – softer and more vulnerable. Between the two of them, they take every trick that comes their way. Mark Wilde and Simon Butteriss lead a perfectly co-ordinated supporting company.

It’s a big piece for a small house to mount, but apart from the dropping of the pastoral divertissement The Faithful Shepherdess in the ball scene, there’s no cutting of corners.Antony McDonald designs and directs a staging that pushes the period of the piece near to the end of Tsarist rule, as opposed to the late 18th century that Tchaikovsky – who retained a sense of fidelity to his Pushkin source – intended. But visually the result works well, notably in the complex crowd scenes of the opening and in the hectic mayhem of the final gambling scene, where the card-obsessed Herman meets his fate. In between, narrative and characterisation are skilfully handled, even if Carl Tanner’s semi-crazed gambler feels physically too controlled – his singing, however, is of high voltage throughout.He’s well partnered by Anne Sophie Duprels’s vulnerable, neurotic Lisa, sung right at the edge of the soprano’s technique, though always just within it. Also making their appreciable marks are Anne-Marie Owens’s touchy, haunted Countess, Quirijn de Lang’s immaculately sung and acted Prince Yeletsky, and Roman Ialcic’s bracing Count Tomsky.There’s excellent work from the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra – new to the Grange Park pit – while conductor Stephen Barlow marshals his forces with enthusiastic panache, even if the ongoing dynamism of the score is not as yet fully realised. Overall, though, this is an appreciable achievement.

In contemporary London, four young Islamist suicide bombers make their plans, which are eventually carried out by two members of the group; a third – a pregnant woman – is prevented by the other female involved from carrying out her mission simply by swapping their respective backpacks. A fourth member, a young man, has already been killed in a police raid.Into this tough emotional and political reality steps a figure from the distant past – the ghost of the first Moghul Emperor, Babur, sung by the versatile baritone Omar Ebrahim. He effortlessly steals his scenes, partly because of the larger-than-life feel of his character, presented as devoted to opium and the bottle. Not surprisingly, perhaps, his off-message interventions fail to persuade the self-styled group of martyrs to abort their murderous mission.What might have been a serious examination of a serious theme feels scuppered by Thayil’s treatment, while Edward Rushton’s score, impeccably well written as it is, leaves few solid traces behind. Yet the performance is unfailingly skilful under conductor Tim Murray, with the four terrorists both dramatically credible and vocally sure-footed. Sarah Beaton’s set, consisting of bank upon bank of plastic bottles all laid upon one another in endless shelves, like a library of books, is a remarkable sight.

Chorus members remain seated at the margins, occasionally commenting on the action. The lovers are all rising stars – or stars already.Elizabeth Llewellyn (Fiordiligi), a veteran of OHP’s Marriage of Figaro who also sang the Countess at English National Opera, has a sumptuous lower register and a sympathetic stage presence. Julia Riley’s open ardent mezzo makes a similarly positive impression as Dorabella. Fresh-voiced Andrew Staples (Ferrando) spins a poignant lyrical line with the best of them, and has already been snapped up to sing Tamino at Covent Garden.Dawid Kimberg (Guglielmo), a South African baritone from that house’s Young Artists Programme, has the evening’s biggest voice and limitless potential. It is difficult not to succeed as a feisty maid and Joana Seara’s bustling Despina gets the laughs. As Don Alfonso, Nicholas Garrett is no elderly white-faced cynic but a desk-bound realist who sees the need for the world to move on.Romantic emotion and enlightenment reason seem unreconciled at the close, as dust sheets cover the furniture of past hopes.Making his operatic debut, conductor Thomas Kemp goes for vivid contrasts, maximum clarity and a fortepiano continuo – the singers always audible, despite the absence of a pit.

It’s among her best work, incisive as narrative, perceptive in characterisation – only her propensity for inflicting expressionist gestures on the chorus looks, frankly, a bit silly amidst the broadly naturalistic aesthetic. Bullying Enrico’s incestuous interest in his sister may be an addition to the text, but it’s not unduly underlined. Jamie Vartan’s set combines wire grilles (acting as barriers or cages) with a solid stone slab that fractures to reveal the apt Jacobean grandeur of the relics of Holland House. His costumes are magnificent. This is a good-looking show, skilfully visualised virtually throughout.Holland Park has also come up with an exceptionally strong cast able to deliver Donizetti’s demanding bel canto writing with purpose and definition. Russian soprano Elvira Fatykhova has all the notes for the title role and sings with resilience and subtlety. Aldo Di Toro offers a heightened lyrical charge as her lover Edgardo, blazing away in his passionate scenes, touchingly sensitive in his elegiac final aria. David Stephenson gives Enrico just the right level of brutal baritonal menace. Keel Watson sings the family chaplain, Raimondo, with sympathetic dignity. Nicholas Ransley makes a suitably nasty Normanno. Fuchs’s presentation of Lucia’s ill-fated husband Arturo – which Aled Hall exemplifies vividly – makes him more villainous than usual – it’s arguable that he is another victim of Enrico’s machinations.Excellent work from the chorus (directed by Kelvin Lim), and superb conducting from Stuart Stratford make this a thrilling evening.

Transposing the action from the Latin Quarter of 1830s Paris to squalid present-day Soho is a bold step in emphasising the scenario’s realistic undertones. The streets outside Cafe Momus are crammed with West End shoppers clutching Selfridges and DKNY bags, as well as with thieving kids, bobbies and down-and-outs. Act III’s toll-gate is neatly transferred to a grubby Tube entrance, busy with arriving cleaners and last-train revellers. And the flatmates’ second outburst of domestic revelry is fuelled by some drug-taking. In theory, this all suggests a natural extension of the opera’s concern with small lives scraping a living – and after all, the underlying tragedy of La boheme is that love is not enough to help the characters transcend the ravages of poverty. But Puccini’s score doesn’t play ball. Written to represent a romanticised view of bohemian life dating from 60 years before its composition, it’s too opulent, passionate and full of joie de vivre to be sprayed like graffiti onto a present-day urban canvas.Perhaps all this grit and gloom seeps into Kirill Karabits’s sometimes earthbound conducting of the score – moments of expansiveness tend to sag with heaviness and Puccini’s kaleidoscopic orchestral colours are slightly dulled, along with their ability to shift as instantly as a passing thought.There’s some impressive singing, though, led by David Lomeli’s Rodolfo and Ekaterina Scherbachenko’s Mimâ??Â¨ – both of them capable of creating a large, passionate sound, even if the flames of their love are slow to ignite. Scherbachenko is an especially credible heroine – idealistic rather than naive and neither painfully waif-like nor falsely courageous. Even this strong cast fails to rise above its surroundings. But perhaps that’s the intention.

Stephen Brimson Lewis has designed incredible, cinematic sets incorporating multimedia to great effect as the action switches from the shadows and starlight of Parisian garrett rooftops and the exuberant bustle of bohemian cafe culture in the Madcap years to the painterly winter tableaux of Act III. Extravagant diversive rather than outrageously distracting.This popular story is, in the main, enjoyably light-hearted and the cast are infectiously jovial when playing the scenes packed with joie de vivre and mischief – especially the musing philosopher Marcello (David Kempster) and his on-off fickle flirt of a muse Musetta (Kate Valentine), both on fine form. Rodolfo (Alex Vicens) and Mimi (Anita Hartig) are charmingly believable lead lovers while one of WNO’s long-associated conducters Carlo Rizzi arouses much warmth from the familiar score.Act II packs the stage with a flamboyant chorus of students, hawkers, shopkeepers, working girls, crossdressers and soldiers in sharp contrast with the touching, chilled quiet of Act III’s opening scenes. Then lovers are once more reconciled as a very sick Mimi dies not of mal du siecle, but consumption. Much to admire.

621,Don Giovanni review at Garsington Opera Wormsley,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2012/don-giovanni-review-at-garsington-opera-wormsley/,Don Giovanni,Garsington Opera Wormsley,Don Giovanni review at Garsington Opera Wormsley,,2012-06-06,Edward Bhesania,"Launching Garsington Opera’s second season at its new home – the airy, Japanese-inspired pavilion set in the Getty family’s 2,500-acre Chilterns estate – this Don Giovanni, directed by Daniel Slater, is both refreshingly modern and occasionally lacklustre. Leslie Travers’s designs take the form of chic cubicle-type rooms, all white panels and aluminium trim, with equally minimalist white furniture to match. But the rooms are confusingly multi-use: the Commendatore’s bed is later appropriated by the serial philanderer Giovanni to seduce Zerlina; and though Ottavio is sitting at a computer in another room before the action begins, Leporello later occupies it to print out the famous list of his master’s conquests.Some of the ideas – such as reversing Giovanni’s and Anna’s roles at the beginning, so that Anna becomes a teasing dominatrix, cuffing Giovanni to the dinner table – are hard to incorporate seamlessly into the drama; others, such as Giovanni’s serenade to (traditionally) Elvira’s maid, are weakly handled. But Elvira, Anna and Ottavio amusingly gatecrash Giovanni’s party in the guise of Wonder Woman and an S&M couple; Zerlina and her bridesmaids are colourfully blingy and scantily clad; and in the final scene Giovanni controls his huge LCD TV via his iPad while awaiting his guest. His punishment is not to descend into hell, but instead to languish in a lunatic asylum.Sophie Bevan is dramatically expressive as Elvira, though sometimes sounds laboured. Grant Doyle and Joshua Bloom convey a macho camaraderie as Giovanni and Leporello, and Jesus Leon stands out for his Italianate Ottavio, as does Mary Bevan for her agile Zerlina. But the Garsington Opera Orchestra’s playing, under Douglas Boyd, is the biggest draw. Boyd coaxes exquisite balance from his players, and is passionately attuned both to the music’s turbulence and intimacy.

It remains a good-looking show. Es Devlin’s multilevel sets are brilliantly achieved, their references to the brutality of a crumbling dictatorship memorably realised. The complex background of Herod’s decadent court is amply sketched in, with all his guests at his dinner party with a difference making their individual and collective marks. Some of the foreground performances, too, are special – Rosalind Plowright fields a Herodias combining sophistication with menace, and Stig Andersen’s vocally punchy and neurotically obsessive Herod can’t take his eyes off his stepdaughter.This, however, is somewhat surprising, as Angela Denoke’s Salome is insipid. Undeniably game in her dance – visualised by McVicar as a procession through a sequence of rooms and dresses – she lacks the star quality such a star role needs; her vocalism, too, is compromised by a weak top register and so-so diction. As the prophet John the Baptist, who fascinates and is destroyed by her, Latvian bass-baritone Egils Silins is similarly problematic; the voice is large and handsome, but his dramatic charge is comparatively low. These are major weaknesses at the heart of the performance.Conductor Andris Nelsons, however, seizes the limelight and brings the orchestra up to top form, elucidating the scintillating detail of Strauss’s score and making its sheer beauty resound with extraordinary impact. Maybe there are points when a touch more violence is needed, but the coherence and sweep of this modernist masterpiece are rarely so perfectly conveyed.

Fortunately, it is also one of his best mature operas, and one of only a handful that survives entirely intact.Conductor Laurence Cummings serves up the full glory of the score in this new Garsington production. His incisive direction from the harpsichord draws crisp and buoyant playing from the pit musicians – a stylish period sound on modern instruments. Director David Freeman’s clear direction and David Roger’s modern dress designs (tracksuits for the athletes, military uniforms, etc) help decipher the inevitable twists and turns of the early 18th century libretto. Freeman even manages to work in some humour – a rare commodity in Baroque opera – in his staging of the Games themselves. In a montage-like interlude we witness competitors’ variously successful attempts in the boxing ring, at shot put and on the track, complete with Chariot’s of Fire slow-motion running – a joke which would have been obvious enough without an orchestral quotation from Vangelis’s theme.A strong cast is headed by Italian mezzo Rosa Bove, making her UK debut, and male soprano Michael Maniaci – equally impressive at sensitive beauty and astonishing vocal pyrotechnics.This is Garsington’s second year at Wormsley where, in the sunshine, the splendid country estate surroundings ensure a divine experience. On less clement days, such as L’Olimipiade’s opening night, the wintry draft and drumming rain on the Pavilion roof might deter less stoical opera-goers. That no one seems to mind, and that the singers, breath visible in the chill air, cope so remarkably is testament to the commitment and high quality of opera at Garsington.

Much of Acts I and II (amalgamated into a long first half) drag due to vague exposition, under-par singing and shaky ensemble. Conductor Nicholas Kraemer demonstrates Mozartean affinity, whipping up spine-tingling excitement in the splendidly-sung chorus scenes, but he fails to galvanise the cast consistently – too many sloppy corners indicate the music is not sufficiently under the skin. The charismatic English Chamber Orchestra winds do justice to the delights of Mozart’s Mannheim-tailored score, shining in Ilia’s gently bubbling Act II aria; but the texture is dominated by a stodgily-played harpsichord, raised on a platform above the other musicians.Vocally, the show belongs – by a mile – to graceful South Korean soprano Hye-Youn Lee, beguiling as Elettra. In dashing Napoleonic greatcoat, Daniela Lehner carries off the castrato role of Idamante, but David Danholt’s laboured Idomeneo and Amy Freston’s insensitive Ilia leave much to be desired. There is genuine pathos in the visually striking, rubble-strewn final act, but if Grange Park aspires to rival Glyndebourne for high-end summer opera it needs to concentrate more on the quality of its principal singers than policing its audience dress code.

Mark Bailey’s traditional designs are sparse, with just a single screen representing Pinkerton’s rented house above Nagasaki. The costumes, however, are authentically sumptuous. Yet John Doyle’s staging is weak in definition, with some individual scenes – Butterfly’s rejection of her wealthy suitor Yamadori, for instance, and even the furious intervention of her uncle the Bonze – going for little. Neither Claire Rutter’s Butterfly nor Marco Panuccio’s Pinkerton convince as credible young lovers, and Panuccio, in particular, more or less throws away his opportunities in the last act. His voice, too, is regularly unsteady.Yet there are good things to offset such disappointments. Rutter’s vocalism is confident and accomplished, and her dramatic performance improves considerably once past the impossible task of presenting a 15-year-old child bride; even so, hers is a broad-brush-stroke account, with numerous possibilities left unexplored. Stephen Gadd cleans up comprehensively with his finely judged account of the American consul, Sharpless. Andrew Rees makes something solid out of the marriage broker Goro, and Sara Fulgoni tackles Butterfly’s maid Suzuki with seriousness; yet the relationship between the two women is scarcely explored.Conductor Gianluca Marciano inspires a high standard of playing from the English Chamber Orchestra, and conveys an outgoing quality that matches the passionate score; but once again much of Puccini’s detailed writing escapes him and the sense of musical drama comes and goes.

Glanert’s source, however, is the far more serious play by Albert Camus, written during the Second World War, which Michael Grandage staged at the Donmar back in 2003.Camus’ philosophical view of the character is that the young emperor, unhinged by the death of his sister and lover Drusilla, embarks upon a campaign of increasingly bizarre and violent misrule in accordance with a despairing view of human existence as meaningless. Glanert’s version, setting a libretto by Hans-Ulrich Treichel sung here in a skilful new English translation by Amanda Holden, keeps faith with Camus’ vision of the limitlessly destructive political psychology of those in positions of unchallengeable power.Andrews’ production plays in an enormous set by Ralph Myers recreating a portion of a vast modern sports stadium, where the emperor, his courtiers and the Roman populace, dressed in Alice Babidge’s contemporary costumes, enter into and conclude their grisly dance of death. What impresses about the staging is its ability to hold back. Andrews resists the temptation to go too far, too soon – though there are, as there have to be, moments of genuine shock and horror; yet you never feel that they’re gratuitous. The result is a focused and intelligent piece of work that explores the psychology of dictatorship and its impact not only on those who are ruled but on the ruler himself. The presence of actor Zoe Hunn, representing the dead Drusilla, acts as a reminder of what has preceded Caligula’s catastrophic crack-up.We’ve not heard much of the 61-year-old Glanert’s music in the UK thus far, but this 2006 work is immediate in its impact and extraordinary in its accomplishment. Much of the writing significantly references early modernist scores, such as Salome and Elektra, though Glanert’s orchestral ear is, if anything, even finer than Strauss’. The result has tremendous potency without bludgeoning the audience into submission; much of it, indeed, is subtle and even beautiful. Ryan Wigglesworth conducts a completely authoritative performance.The cast excels, too, in the huge demands placed upon them – notably Pavlo Hunka as the politician Cherea, Yvonne Howard as Caligula’s grandly conspiratorial wife Caesonia, and Christopher Ainslie in his immaculately sung performance of Caligula’s slave, Helicon. Peter Coleman-Wright takes on the enormous challenge of the title role, a gigantic assignment he brings off with boundless commitment and imaginative expertise. Taken as a whole, the result is clearly one of the operatic events of the year.

The audience sits on all four sides of a sunken pit where the 14-piece Max Richter Ensemble is stationed. The result feels more like an installation than an opera – partly because so much of the text, based on the cult book SUM: Forty Tales from the Afterlives, by the American neuroscientist David Eagleman – is spoken. Sixteen of his short stories – each a kind of reflective leap of imagination into scientifically conceived ideas – are featured. From a philosophical point of view, they’re often fascinating.What impresses about the evening is not just how well the performers accomplish their difficult tasks but how integrated the whole show is. Lorna Heavey’s videos include figures, letters, words and views of contemporary London. Lucy Carter’s lighting is strongly atmospheric. As well as singing and moving around the space, occasionally interacting with the audience, the three principals have to deliver acres of spoken text. They do so skilfully, even if something derived from a non-narrative book necessarily has little specifically dramatic impact.Max Richter’s score provides atmosphere, too. It consists largely of simple concords and gentle discords slowly repeated or mutating – it’s fairly straightforward minimalism, plus occasional ambient sounds and some electronics, with a crass Hollywood ending unfortunately tacked on. Admirers of Eagleman might love its generally respectful approach, but conversely it adds little to what one might gain from reading the original. Some books, perhaps, are better left just as books.

The composer eschews fairy godmothers, pumpkin coaches and glass slippers, concentrating instead on the human story yet his sparkling music indicates the prevailing mood should be life-affirming comedy. Hall offers some funny moments – the slick manoeuvres of Armando Noguera’s Dandini and Umberto Chiummo’s seedy Don Magnifico around a bench in their Act II duet is comedy gold – but more laughs are needed. Despite lively chorus routines, much of the staging feels creekily old-fashioned, especially the footlight clustering for the frantic “what on earth is happening?” ensembles. Hildegard Bechtler’s period sets, though impressively realistic, are drab – the Prince’s plain plaster-clad ballroom sorely needs glamour and glitter.Fortunately the strong cast ensures there is much to enjoy. Vocally stunning, and shining with personality, American mezzo Elizabeth DeShong achieves power and sensitivity with her rich, focused voice, and dazzles with precise, fluent coloratura. Her Cenerentola is well-partnered by Taylor Stayton’s appealing Don Ramiro. Another house debut, 2007 Cardiff winner Shenyang displays a velvety baritone, but not enough subtlety for the ambiguous character of Alidoro. The most vibrant portrayals are those of deliciously-observed and sumptuous-voiced ugly sister duo Elena Xanthoudakis and Victoria Yaravaya. Conductor James Gaffigan keeps the pace moving and the ensemble tight – but his relentless drive and the muscular, aggressive sound he draws from the London Philharmonic strings often go against the grain of Rossini’s buoyant geniality. Combined with the carefree Glyndebourne trappings, however, the high musical values and intermittent liveliness of this production guarantee a pleasurable experience.

Brave those steep, ship-like auditorium steps to experience a contemporary compact two-hour version of this operetta classic incorporating hot pants and leather jackets.This company of orphaned pirates and flat-footed policemen clearly enjoy bouncing around their detail-filled, pint-sized set, executing some cutesy umbrella choreography and witty direction (including creating a Young Frederick puppet out of cleverly-manoeuvred cloth pieces).Unfortunately, apart from Roger Parkins as a jolly, clear voiced and audience-enticing Major General, most other performances come across as rather two-dimensional and the singing is questionable. Owen Pullar as Frederick certainly looks the part, although his take on the character is more chart-topping One Direction than glorious-voiced tenor pirate apprentice. Elsie Bennett’s Mabel has all the required grace and softness, and yet her vocal fragility and limited projection hold her back from injecting some real soul and tension into the dramatic moments.Feisty Darrie Gardner as Ruth seems slightly at odds when not directly involved in the action. Generally, it is the men who are at the heart of this nautical journey, with Guy Mott deserving a mention as lovable, growling rogue Pirate King while Simeon Oakes throws himself into the role of Samuel with plenty of truth and dedication. The girls all giggle along suitably and Chloe Nicholson as Kate stands out adding watchable moments of kooky personality to the ensemble.A pleasantly swift affair, this production does endear more as it travels through the acts. However, as much as one applauds the efforts of bringing Gilbert and Sullivan into the 21st century, most voices seem more suited to the contemporary musical theatre repertoire and the authenticity and full splendour of the score is therefore lost.

But for many Africans it remains all too real. The fact that many of the townships from which the Isango performers hail are amongst the world’s highest TB infection areas gives this production – in partnership with The Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria – genuine poignancy.The fin de siecle Parisian setting is relocated to a South African township in 1976, the atmosphere imaginatively evoked with makeshift door-frames on wooden boards. The libretto has been translated colloquially, the lush orchestration freely adapted for a battery of marimbas and steel drums, periodically augmented by folk-style choral singing. This rarely does Puccini’s score justice – the texture frequently lacks depth and romantic sweep is compromised – but on its own terms the sound world is often magical.Musetta’s song has a seductive calypso beat, shimmering marimbas provide an ethereal glow for Mimi’s final moments, and the a cappella ending is moving.The principal cast display impressive voices – the lovers’ quartet at the end of Act III is a delight. The most memorable moments are when the company goes ‘off-piste’, letting its hair down with joyous dancing and chanting. Everyone sings and plays from memory throughout, imbuing the performance with remarkable directness.

As with the largely well-received Rusalka in 2009, the director is Melly Still, on this occasion working with designers Tom Pye (sets) and Dinah Collin (costumes).The result feels only halfway to a genuine success. Glyndebourne’s policy is to perform in the original Czech, though with this particular piece and a largely Anglophone cast an English translation might have given the show greater immediacy. The designs are hit-and-miss, and often curiously uncertain in their depictions of the individual animals and insects. Instead, they reflect human characteristics whose significance is not always obvious. While a Disney-like approach is wisely avoided – Janacek’s view of his creations is anything but sentimental – neither the overall look nor the movement (choreographed by Maxine Doyle) provides consistent visual impetus.If things pick up somewhat after the interval, that’s partly due to the lively Fox sung by Emma Bell, while Lucy Crowe’s Vixen is energetic throughout, though not quite supplying the star impact required (her odd costuming doesn’t help). The village inn scenes, founded on Adrian Thompson’s schoolmaster (he also doubles as the mosquito), Mischa Schelomianski’s priest (doubling as the badger) and Sergei Leiferkus’s forester, seem to tread water. Leiferkus, indeed, feels oddly inhibited throughout. Conductor Vladimir Jurowski conducts a tight and detailed performance, though once again it falls short of real emotional sweep.

Poet Tony Harrison’s text derives from different versions of The Ballad of the Cruel Sister, familiar in various folk cultures but always dealing with the ancient story of the Dark Sister who drowns the Fair Sister out of jealousy. From the victim’s body a harp is fashioned which denounces the murderer, who is buried alive as punishment.The piece’s ritualistic folk aspects and overall psychological darkness reflect regular Birtwistle preoccupations, though music plays a relatively small role in the overall result, which blends speech, song and movement into a loose dramatic amalgam that on this occasion felt about ten minutes too long for its repetitive, circular material.Actors and musicians double up and swap roles, moving from speech to song to playing flutes, pipes, oboes, penny whistles and percussion. Despite the obvious versatility of the young performers taking part here, the piece needs a musical and dramatic tightness only partially achieved on this occasion. Some of the looming menace and sense of violence and retribution of the original comes across, though not quite enough of its formal structure or feeling of inevitability. There are some untidy moments. Maybe with further performances as the piece moves around the country the show will gain the focus and tautness it currently lacks.

The setting is the 1950s, with Falstaff residing in a heavily oak-panelled, upmarket hotel, and Alice Ford’s kitchen the last word in stylish period design. Up to the interval, Paul Steinberg’s sets supply visual magic aplenty; ironically, there’s less on show in the mock-fairy shenanigans of the final scene.But Carsen’s direction remains pacy and moment by moment-specific, making sure that Verdi’s complex, humane opera bounces merrily along – even if Rupert the horse steals rather more attention throughout the third act than he should.The high-quality cast provides one or two hard to match performances. With his prodigious voice, Italian baritone Ambrogio Maestri challenges memories of Bryn Terfel – Covent Garden’s most recent Falstaff – in the title role. Ana Maria Martinez’s radiant soprano melds with a winning personality to make her Alice special. Marie-Nicole Lemieux offers a quite different version of Mistress Quickly to the equally successful one she presented at Glyndebourne. Dalibor Jenis probes the relative psychological darkness of Ford, though his Texan disguise as Signor Fontana rings false.The young lovers are beautifully sketched in by Amanda Forsythe’s pristine Nannetta and Joel Prieto’s lithe Fenton, though the latter could do with a brighter ring at the top of his pleasant light tenor. Lukas Jakobski and Alasdair Elliott respectively make a couple of hefty meals of Pistol and Bardolph.In the pit Daniele Gatti conducts a spry performance of a piece that demands absolute precision.

Incorporating timeless Japanese theatrical traditions, the staging shifts between a naturalistic 1900s setting and abstract fancy-flights dominated by vividly colourful panoramic back-vistas. Dancers’ streaming ribbons effectively convey the Bonze’s wrath at Butterfly’s marriage to Pinkerton, momentarily transcending the mundane sliding-screen backdrop of Pinkerton’s house. The glorious love duet steps outside reality into a magical 1930s musical-style fantasy world with dancing lanterns and fluttering petals. But the use of a puppet to represent Butterfly’s young child is a failure, sapping the scenes of poignancy. However slick the three puppeteers, they are a barrier – it is impossible to feel real sympathy or sorrow. The tormented Butterfly puppet in the dream-state Act 2 orchestral interlude is more effective (though the unnecessary second interval beforehand disrupts the flow).It is clearly impossible to cast a 15 year old in the title role, but crucial to have a plausible portrayal. Full-bodied voice notwithstanding, that is what Mary Plazas provides with her petite build and bright persona. Her Un bel di is too refined to set the pulse racing, but her final scenes pack an emotional punch. Gywn Hughes Jones is vocally solid, his Pinkerton almost sympathetic. Pamela Helen Stephen and John Fanning head a strong supporting cast.Conductor Oleg Caetani maintains a lively pace, evoking vibrant, plush sounds from an ENO orchestra on terrific form, but he sometimes short-changes the big romantic moments. Underpowered emotion lets down the production overall, but Minghella’s entrancing vision succeeds nevertheless because it works in sympathy with the score – sadly not something that can be taken for granted.

Sadly, the condition of his voice on this occasion was worrying. The top register felt stressed and diminished. Many notes were approached gingerly and then cut short. A few phrases were entirely dropped. Despite a game acting performance, this is not the vocal level he needs to reach to hold a position as an international tenor. [It has since transpired that Villazon has been suffering from acute bronchitis and was replaced for several shows by Ukrainian tenor Dmytro Popov]. Let’s hope it was just an off-night.Latvian soprano Maija Kovalevska sings Mimi. Her voice has some stamina if not quite enough power or stability to make her mark as the luminous personality Puccini envisaged, though, like Villazon, she is more than presentable dramatically.But some of the production’s other newcomers hit the spot. Norwegian baritone Audun Iversen’s full, rounded tone provided the basis for a warm and winning Marcello. Serbian bass-baritone David Bizic enters fully into the spirit of the production as Schaunard. Ukrainian-American soprano Stefania Dovhan has the looks and personality to command attention as Musetta, and much of her singing is bright and breezy. Best of all was the Argentine bass Nahuel Di Pierro, who seized all his opportunities as Colline and provided the evening’s vocal highlight with his Coat Song.Two stalwart British artists – Jeremy White and Donald Maxwell – give flawless accounts of Benoit and Alcindoro respectively, and Sir Mark Elder’s conducting is precise, perceptive and flexible.

Each achieves something vital and engaging – though in Kent’s case some serious qualification is necessary. Musically, the evening would be hard to better. The ENO’s orchestra and chorus are on world-beating form, Edward Gardner conducts to thrilling effect, and the four principals all excel.American bass James Creswell presents a darkly Byronic Dutchman, whose doom-laden angst is conveyed in a consistently beautiful tone. Orla Boylan is a fearless Senta, attacking this notoriously intractable role with exceptional command. Clive Bayley explores Senta’s father Daland’s greed in a bass that grows ever more impressive. In an exciting display of Heldentenor singing, Stuart Skelton ensures that Senta’s rejected boyfriend Erik registers as a major player.Designed by Paul Brown, Kent’s modern-dress staging is gripping but nevertheless goes seriously off the rails in the third act. Initially visualised as a child who encounters the legend of the accursed sea-captain in her bedtime reading, Senta is presented as an oddball fantasist whose dream creation appears on her doorstep with the arrival of the mysterious and wealthy stranger her father wants her to marry. So far so good. But her nightmare in the third act, when the grotesquely dressed guests at her betrothal party – her father’s crew – subject her to a vicious sexual attack, rings false; in Wagner’s libretto Senta is not even on stage at this point. The production’s final moments, when she commits suicide with a broken bottle, are also unconvincing.

In exploring the nature and meanings of home, Vardimon (who also directs) presents a simple three-sided room – a blank canvas or empty shell in which a pair of dancers, Esteban Fourmi and Aoi Nakamura, form a now swaying, now intertwining couple whose only possession is domestic bliss. With striking simplicity and symbolism, Jesse Collett’s childlike drawings of windows, door and fireplace  are, literally, projections. The couple is subjected to threats real and imaginary, from both within and without, as the fabric of their home is gradually permeated and destroyed. The two singers, Victoria Couper and Melanie Pappenheim, appear as ghostly white banshees within the room, though it is impossible to make out their words. Fitkin manages to work a sense of form and development into his typically punchy score – his amplified band, sneeringly noir at the work’s climax, is pungently shot through with trumpet, soprano saxophones and hectically strumming guitar and harp.Hannon wrote his own lyrics for Sevastopol, which is inspired by Tolstoy’s experiences on the front line in that Black Sea city during the Crimean War. There is an empathy here with the suffering wounded and the fearing able-bodied – and Emma Bailey’s designs are richly atmospheric, but although there is an attractive lyrical vein in Hannon’s music, which is naturally well written for voices, the disjointed musical scenes stem dramatic flow, and at times the style wavers disconcertingly between Gilbert and Sullivan parody and West End bluster.

The big change this time is in the title role of Marie, the adopted “daughter” of a regiment of French soldiers. Natalie Dessay’s dazzlingly energetic, totally immersed creation of the tomboy heroine for this production was always going to be a tough act to follow and Patrizia Ciofi – new to the role here, having played it elsewhere – does not eclipse it. Her slightly husky voice lacks the pinging clarity of Dessay, her comic timing is less sharp, her dramatic sense not as compelling. But Dessay is unique. By less super-human standards Ciofi turns in a good performance, ably conveying Marie’s petulance, volatility and sensitivity – her two romantic arias are genuinely touching.Her love-interest, Tonio, is played by Colin Lee, who had previously followed in the footsteps of Juan Diego Florez. His endearingly awkward charm gives the romance sincerity, and his voice is impressively free – he takes the string of top Cs in Act 1 in his stride. Newcomer Alan Opie plays the flamboyantly moustached Sergeant Sulpice with enjoyable relish, and Ann Murray again demonstrates her peerless dry comic stagecraft as the Marquise de Berkenfeld. Fortunately Ann Widdecombe does not need to do much acting in her spoken cameo as a matronly imperious Duchess de Crackentorp, receiving hearty laughter for references to Cornish pasties and Strictly Come Dancing. Yves Abel’s idiomatic conducting is lively and assured.A little shine may have worn off the production this time around, but this is still a greatly entertaining evening.

Their business relationship had already deteriorated to such an extent that rescuing the production seemed futile until finally it closed after 123 performances and remains all but struck from the repertoire. The Finborough, as part of its Celebrating British Music Theatre series has gamely resurrected this all but forgotten operetta, giving it a respectable treatment with a sympathetic cast. The plot, featuring a troupe of actors performing a political coup is as daft as any of the Savoy operas but problems occur from far too many plot twists and the lack of a central romance.Fortunately Gilbert’s humour survives intact and there are still some laugh-out-loud moments in the libretto. Stefan Bednarczyk as Ludwig, Bruce Graham as Dr Tannhauser and Richard Suart as Rudolph are all excellent in recognisable Gilbert and Sullivan roles. But undoubtedly it is the marvellous Charlotte Page who steals the show as Julia Jellicoe. Page not only does justice to Julia’s aria in the second act but she also possesses exquisite comic timing perfectly suited to Gilbert’s topsy-turvy world.Performing on a borrowed stage with questionable costume and wig decisions this production looks distinctly amateur considering the Finborough’s track record for design. Given the liberties taken with Gilbert and Sullivan today, it’s a shame that director Martin Milnes does not follow suit and tailor both the dialogue and score to make it more palatable to modern audiences.

Michael Vale’s enterprising set remains as striking as before – a huge, steeply inclined, corroding iron sheet conjures up a bleak vision of a Mantuan court that’s as deviant as its libidinous Duke. The set rotates to reveal Rigoletto’s ramshackle dwelling, a physical reminder that the acerbic, performing court jester has a flip side in the self-pitying widower who’s obsessively protective of his daughter Gilda.Typically, this production has presented the Duke in an especially despicable light. The odd chink in this revival’s armour actually lies in the vocal prowess of Italian star Vittorio Grigolo, new to the role here – he is vocally so vibrant, agile and charismatic on the one hand and so expressively tender on the other that we can only see him, at worst, as a naively changeable Duke, not as a manipulator with a master plan. In his passionate E il sol dell’anima he seduces not only Gilda but the entire audience – not for nothing does the vocal line trace a priapic ascent. Singing Gilda, Ekaterina Siurina is a good match. Her Caro nome combines blissful afterglow with technical display and breathtaking artistry. If Dimitri Platanias’ Rigoletto is less immediately eye-catching, that’s down to Verdi, but he injects as much sophistication as this tormented character can tolerate.Sir John Eliot Gardiner, in the pit, fully exploits the score’s colour and dramatic contrasts. It’s a thrilling night, certainly worth catching, if not at Covent Garden itself, then at one of the 165 UK cinemas that will broadcast a live screening on April 17.

Circus Tricks, with music by Adey Grummet and a libretto by Mike Henry, is the third incarnation of what began life in 2008 as a five minute piece, and focuses on four circus acts (two of them duos). The first part of the show introduces the acts – a knife thrower and his assistant, a trapeze artist, an acrobatic duo and a contortionist – in the glare of performance, but beneath the public exterior we hear their inner voices drilling them in their well-rehearsed moves.In the second half these focused inner thoughts mingle with their private insecurities, anxieties and dreams – the knife-thrower’s assistant secretly loves her duo partner, the contortionist laments her loneliness. By turns amusing and touching, the Trick Pony conforms to this pattern too.There’s an element of the piece being a hostage to the formula of each act taking the spotlight in turn (and in each half) while the others fade into the background, and there’s a far-fetched last-minute plot twist. But Christopher Diffey is vocally effusive as the Trick Pony (somehow managing not to appear self-conscious), Yvette Bonner takes flight in her aptly stratospheric role as the naively enthusiastic trapeze artist and Lilly Papaioannou makes a suitably slinky contortionist.Grummet’s score may lean heavily on Stravinsky, Varese and cabaret music, but the result is chic, rhythmically sharp and on occasion lyrically appealing. Having expanded in two bursts, though, Circus Tricks could perhaps now do with some trimming.

Weir, now 58, has kept faith with the genre ever since the distinctive and appealing voice of her first full-length piece, A Night at the Chinese Opera, attracted attention back in 1987. Her new work is based on an old Sicilian folk-tale brought up to date in the composer’s own libretto and in Chen Shi-Zheng’s bright and breezy staging.The opera begins topically enough with a financial crash, in which Lord and Lady Fortune lose all their money. Their daughter Tina’s response is to try to make her own way in the world by sheer hard graft – initially in a clothing factory, later in a launderette. Mysterious intruders, though, destroy the first; later a gang of attackers wreck friendly kebab-seller Hassan’s mobile stall. Social unrest, it seems, is rampant. But in fact these are the minions of Fate – amiably personified by counter-tenor Andrew Watts – who regularly intervenes in Tina’s life, eventually obligingly altering the number of her lottery ticket to the winning one. Meanwhile, she’s met good guy Simon. Happy ending.If only life were that simple. There’s an air of whimsy about the enterprise that doesn’t wholly convince. Nor, in its entirety, does Weir’s score, despite its articulacy and frequent charm; there’s a lack of momentum and a dearth of really strong ideas. But the cast is impressive, and the interventions of breakdancers from the Soul Mavericks crew offer some visual highlights.

The big scenes – the disastrous party at Madam Larina’s house, and the grand St Petersburg ball – go well, but so do the intimate moments. Designer Joanna Parker’s set makes use of a mirror tripling up as projection screen and scrim, allowing audiences to view multiple perspectives on the action. Visually, the show is beautifully presented.Musical and vocal standards are high, too. Nicholas Lester is a first class Onegin, flaunting his hauteur in a commanding baritone. Sarah-Jane Davies’s Tatyana is more frustrating. Here is a wonderful soprano whose stage potential is held back as yet by dramatic inhibition, but she is very promising. Jaewoo Kim’s Lensky is delivered with depth of feeling and an easy stage manner, but his sung English needs attention (David Lloyd-Jones’s translation is used).Making much of secondary roles are Niamh Kelly’s vivacious Olga, Frances McCafferty’s finely-crafted Filippyevna – what a lesson for other performers – and Andrew Glover’s sophisticated Monsieur Triquet. Stephen Holloway’s Prince Gremin is distinguished.Fine work from all departments of the orchestra, and lively singing from ETO’s chorus – a pity that their peasants’ number in the opening scene is cut. But conductor Michael Rosewell knows how Tchaikovsky’s score should go, and it makes its mark.

Hilarious conspiratorial touches, such as the pit orchestra striking up before the stage ‘musicians’ have begun to play, deserve all the laughs they get.Grant Doyle’s charismatic Figaro is a delight, and Andrew Slater’s Bartolo an essay in comic timing. His tone-deaf rendition of a trite song to Rosina is priceless, and his marvellously clear patter leaves even Gilbert and Sullivan’s Major General standing. Kitty Whately displays a beautiful voice (insecurity at the very top notwithstanding) and feisty personality as Rosina, and Nicholas Sharratt is a personable Count.The orchestra is spirited, and it is great to have Rossini’s glockenspiel adding extra sparkle to tutti climaxes – gamely played by a one-man percussionist simultaneously pedalling cymbals and bass drum.Even with Paul McGrath’s incisive conducting maintaining momentum, it is a long evening. The potential benefit of losing Berta the maid’s aria is negated by the restoration of Almaviva’s mammoth bravura showcase, which Rossini himself realised pointlessly delays the denouement (he recycled it in La Cenerentola). Even so, the time whizzes by. Hugely entertaining and highly recommended.

The piece’s first Covent Garden staging comes in the shape of a production created by the directorial duo of Jossi Wieler and Sergio Morabito for the 2008 Salzburg Festival, here revived by Samantha Seymour.UK audiences have been spoilt by two superb stagings of the piece over the last 30 years. Designed by the late Stefanos Lazaridis, David Pountney’s 1983 ENO production returned again and again – a Freudian interpretation of the piece, it was also visually magical. On a similar level was Antony McDonald’s more traditional 2008 version for Grange Park Opera, revived last summer.Unfortunately the Royal Opera’s import can’t match them. The basic setting is a central European brothel, whose sleazy ambience seems an odd place to find a water nymph with tail initially attached. Where Pountney and McDonald conveyed psychological perception through the prism of visual beauty, Wieler and Morabito offer something far less acute and more mundane. The production team was roundly booed at their curtain call.Some strong cast members – notably Bryan Hymel’s vocally handsome Prince, and Petra Lang’s grandly malevolent Foreign Princess – make up for a disappointing Camilla Nylund in the title role, but even together with the momentum of Yannick Nezet-Seguin’s conducting, it is not enough to save the evening.

The threatened demonstrators turned out – as far as this observer could see – to consist of one man standing outside the Coliseum with a placard, and he was easily outnumbered by the several cameramen come to film the non-riot that actually took place.John Adams’ opera to a libretto by Alice Goodman has generated plenty of heat in the past – more because of the subject itself than its treatment, which those who have experienced it have broadly agreed to be fair-minded. The narrative describes an incident that took place back in 1985, when four Palestinian terrorists hijacked the Italian Mediterranean cruise liner Achille Lauro. A disabled American-Jewish passenger, Leon Klinghoffer, was gratuitously and senselessly murdered, and his body and wheelchair thrown overboard. Klinghoffer’s family have continued to object to the representation of this appalling act, while others have complained about the supposed romanticising of terrorism involved in putting such individuals onstage to air their views. These are scarcely unfamiliar images, however, to film-goers, theatre audiences, or television viewers. Why anyone would wish to put difficult contemporary subject matter off-limits to operatic composers is a mystery. The result, though, has been effectively to silence the opera, which has had surprisingly few stagings given its composer’s stature. At last London audiences can see it and make up their own minds.In another worthwhile initiative, ENO invites Tom Morris to stage the opera, with Tom Pye providing the sets and Laura Hopkins the costumes. The complex view the piece takes of the tragic, ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict is immediately suggested in the two opening choruses – one of exiled Palestinians followed by one of exiled Jews. The same singers represent both groups, changing from one to the other onstage. These beautifully composed pieces, setting Goodman’s thoughtful texts, establish the contemplative nature of much of the writing. For a piece constructed around a notorious act of violence, Klinghoffer is surprisingly static – often more like an oratorio than an opera.Morris’ staging combines sensitivity with imagination. The scene in which Klinghoffer is murdered ratchets up the tension to an almost unbearable degree. Alan Opie’s singing of the consequent Aria of the Falling Body has a surreal poignancy.Conductor Baldur Bronnimann leads a clean and fluent performance of Adams’ lyrical score. Several scenes, however, feel too long – the generally slow pace of the music needs more variety. Kate Miller-Heidke’s turn as the daffy British Dancing Girl provides some unlikely yet much-needed light relief. But overall it’s a remarkable evening, reaching an eloquent end as Michaela Martens, as Marilyn Klinghoffer, grieves angrily for her dead husband.

The singers are miked (as is the orchestra), each show has to chase theatrical effect befitting of the grand setting, the star count is low and audience numbers high. But with scores of priests and priestesses, strapping Egyptian soldiers and oppressed Ethiopian slaves, plus some eye-catching modern yet exotic set and costume designs by Isabella Bywater, this new Aida directed by Stephen Metcalf – with tickets starting from £21.50 – packs in surprising value for your operatic pound.The hall’s vast central arena of stone, gravel and protruding pillars becomes a desert dig site with the pyramids projected on to a triptych of screens placed in front of the organ. Mostly the video projections are evocative of time and place, though in Act II’s military display the screens carry a less effective live overhead view of the Egyptians’ show of military power.The production is sung in the original language, a laudable move, but the surtitle displays are poor, an aspect that needs improving urgently: in the meantime bring binoculars or know Italian. Almost as tiresome is the insertion of the character of Amelia Edwards, the 19th-century Egyptologist, around the action as a dislocated observer. The last thing this grand piece needs is a framing device, let alone one of meagre insight.The singing is often thrilling. In the first of three casts, Indra Thomas’ Aida is florid and effusive, Marc Heller is a suitably heroic Radames, for whose affections Tiziana Carraro’s rich, creamy Amneris makes a persuasive bid. Andrew Greenwood conducts the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra with zeal.

He has the good looks, the ample bass and the sheer physical charisma to excel in the role, and seizes every opportunity – even making advances to a female member of the audience at one point. He is quite simply the leading Don Giovanni of our day.But in Barbara Lluch’s spry revival of Francesca Zambello’s production, the staging comes over with more vitality and point than it has on previous occasions. Partly this is the result of Alex Esposito’s flawless byplay with Schrott as Leporello, in what is opera’s greatest double act. His rough-edged singing and plebeian manner provide the perfect foil to Schrott’s super-confident aristocrat.Strong performances, too, from Matthew Rose’s feisty Masetto, Kate Lindsey’s canny Zerlina and Ruxandra Donose’s half-desperate Elvira. Pavol Breslik’s honestly sung Ottavio comes over as a thoroughly decent sort of bloke, but no-one would look forward to spending an evening with him (though maybe that’s Mozart and Da Ponte’s point). Carmela Remigio’s pinched tone is not ideal for Donna Anna, who needs to provide a counterweight to Elvira. Reinhard Hagen’s Commendatore needs more sheer heft. Are there no British basses the company can call on for such assignments?Underwhelming, too, is Constantinos Carydis’s conducting. Often definitely on the fast side, sometimes a bit slow, his tempo choices are not always successful – he has some interesting interpretative ideas, though they don’t always work. But don’t miss Schrott’s extraordinary performance.

Others have updated to the present, offered contemporary translations, even shifted the audience to the bar to lend an authentic hue to the Cafe Momus scene, but Silent Opera’s production, directed by Daisy Evans, has literally gone underground – to the Old Vic Tunnels beneath Waterloo Station. The music is heard via wireless headphones, the live voices being mixed in with a pre-recorded orchestral recording by the University of London Symphony Orchestra under Daniel Capps.The vault’s drab upper level is well suited to serve as the struggling artists’ garret. The difference is that the audience becomes part of the setting, perching like guests on bean bags, benches and chairs. Marcello is not a painter but a tattoo artist, Rodolfo swaps poetry for computer programming and comic-book writing, and Mimi still loves her flowers but is trying to make it in the fashion industry, while also suffering from anorexia (consumption is so 19th-century).The new translation, by Evans, is sharply contemporary, if unpoetic – the jealous Marcello accuses Musetta of being a ‘prick-tease’. But the opera feels intact and although the canned music delivery may not seem as immersive as hearing a full symphony orchestra, the payback comes in the production’s site-specificity, and in being able to register the reaction of the audience. There’s perhaps a touch too much herding around to follow the action, but it makes for a dynamic experience that is unusual in opera.Importantly, the singing is generally good, with a largely impressive cast. If Alistair’s Digges’ Rodolfo needs more charisma, Emily Ward’s lyrical Mimi and Oliver Dunn’s persuasive Marcello are especially impressive.Puccini in a tunnel with canned accompaniment might not appear to be an operatic Holy Grail, but in this case it genuinely produces more light than heat.

Verdi’s ever-popular opera in three acts tells the story of hedonistic Parisian courtesan Violetta Valery as she falls first for the unobtainable Alfredo Germont, and then fatally ill with consumption. For 2012, Welsh National Opera has revived David McVivar’s careful, moving, traditional 2009 staging to take on tour.There are a number of firsts for the company here. Conductor Julia Jones, who works more often in Europe, returns home to Wales to make her first, elegantly effective guest appearance with WNO. Canadian soprano Joyce El-Khoury makes a decent debut with the company as Violetta, and a last-minute cast change owing to the indisposition of Mexican tenor Carlos Osuna sees Italian-American tenor Leonardo Capalbo step into the role of Alfredo with admirable ease.The elegantly simple scenery and opulent costumes are provided by Scottish Opera – the bustles of the jewel-coloured dresses indicating a slight modernising and updating to the tail end of the 19th century, a time of Tissot – while the stage, draped in swathes of black, belies a sense of foreboding, shrouding the cast as love and death play out. Capalbo proves himself capable, believable and emotive as the confused and jealous lover, if slightly clowning as a drunk. However, despite good tonality and movement, both leads lack dramatic oomph. Elsewhere, highlights are provided by the Act II gypsies and matadors ballet sequence, while Eddie Wade is strong as Baron Douphol.

Unfortunately, Offenbach himself died before completing the score, which means that since the 1881 premiere onwards it’s been subject to the additions, subtractions and rewritings of well-meaning but lesser hands. The situation has become more complicated in recent years, due to the discovery of additional numbers not included in the premiere.ENO’s new production plays some of this rediscovered material, as well as an aria from another Offenbach operetta that has been regularly added in since 1904. The result is structurally incoherent, though a conductor more intent than Antony Walker upon seeking out the music’s character might have helped it through.As it is, a lot of the evening’s singing is strong. Christine Rice’s Nicklausse is vocally glamorous, though looks unfortunate in Buki Shiff’s schoolboy uniform costume. Clive Bayley gives good value as the four villains who dog Hoffmann’s tracks. Georgia Jarman’s presentation of all four of Hoffmann’s variously unviable beloveds is assured, but she makes her strongest impression as Antonia.Barry Banks throws everything he has at the title role, but it’s not enough, vocally or dramatically. Meanwhile, director Richard Jones, whose strongest suit is the comic-grotesque, curiously fails to capitalise on a piece that would seem to fall right into that category. In Giles Cadle’s antiseptic sets the result looks fussy and muddled, while the piece’s blend of the sinister and the melancholy does not strike home.

Servants eavesdrop and spy on the potential scandals brewing in the Almaviva household – just as they would in real life. They also go about their duties. Above all, there’s a sense of a genuine community concentrated in the castle, with complex relationships in full flower and old scores to be settled. The result feels far more real than Downton Abbey.This production is also notable for the perfect realisation and integration of the small roles – Bonaventura Bottone’s wickedly malicious Basilio and Jeremy White’s mud-encrusted gardener Antonio are flawless – but the main participants are a superior bunch, too. Ildebrando D’Arcangelo’s assertively masculine Figaro matches Aleksandra Kurzak’s spry, fast-thinking Susanna perfectly. Lucas Meachem’s as yet vocally lightweight Count is already dramatically three-dimensional and augurs well for the future. American soprano Rachel Willis-Sorensen’s Countess is full of individuality and insight, with a voice that is certain to go places. Ann Murray’s peppery Marcellina is another joy, offsetting Carlo Lepore’s exceptionally good-humoured Bartolo. Only Anna Bonitatibus’ nicely sung Cherubino disappoints dramatically – she remains resolutely girly in the role of a teenage male.Newly-knighted Sir Antonio Pappano takes musical charge and reminds us, yet again, what an asset he is to our artistic life.

Born in Holborn in 1875, he trained at the Royal College of Music and came to attention with the premiere of his cantata Hiawatha’s Wedding Feast in 1899. With two more sections added, Hiawatha became a choral society standard for decades, and was regularly staged at the Albert Hall. His music later become unfashionable, though there is now a revival underway.Written probably to his own libretto, Thelma was composed in 1907-09 but not performed during Coleridge-Taylor’s lifetime. To his own heavily revised libretto, Christopher Cowell’s discrete and effective production reveals its qualities, but also its faults. The second act is much too long, and the pacing as a whole awkward. But there is some very attractive music here, especially in the scene in the undersea kingdom – a genuine highlight.Thelma is set in Norway in the 11th century, where a standard love triangle is complicated by broken promises and the possession of a magic amulet. It’s naive stuff, as is some of the score, the best of which nevertheless has an almost Dvorak-like charm.Under Jonathan Butcher’s astute baton, the company impresses with strong voices throughout. We may not hear Thelma again for a while, but Surrey Opera has done it proud.

Bill Bankes-Jones’ new English translation is vulgarly appropriate and the tone is unerringly upbeat.Kai Ruutel as a boisterous, naughty Hansel and Ailish Tynan as a timorous yet easily-led Gretel find a sense of playful spirit for their children. Imminent starvation is not on their minds as they break off from their work to trash the house and steal the cream for their tea. It takes a thoroughly enraged appearance of Shuna Scott Sendall as their mother to accentuate the reality of their situation.Jollity is quickly restored by Paul Carey Jones, bright and full-voiced as Peter, the broom-making father. And even his evocation of the witch on her broomstick doesn’t quite portend the edge of darkness that is to come.Once into the woods there is some sense of darkness. Moving and interior-lit tree trunks combine with Mark Doubleday’s inventive and atmospheric lighting design to set the tone, while slow-moving angels at the end of Act II are more unsettling than reassuring.Candy-cotton vitality is returned for Act III with Leah-Marian Jones’ Witch straight out of Oz and insinuating her cruelty rather than flaunting it. A joyful production that makes no blame on the family in their impoverishment, but revels in their happy outcome.

But the Debussy-inflected score has a refreshing integrity, and boasts some of the composer’s sweetest and most sincere music. It also benefits from a heart-warming story and, almost uniquely, a happy ending.The “West” of the title is the early 1900s American frontier, but Robert Chevara’s ballsy new production for OperaUpClose relocates the action to modern-day London – hence West End Girl. The updating, including scenes in a dodgy internet cafe and an underground car park, works remarkably well – there is hardly anything Wild West-specific about the music, anyway. The gold-mining population becomes a gang of eastern European immigrants who meet in Minnie’s cafe to drink, gamble, reminisce about “home” and watch Strictly Come Dancing – played with relish and plausibility by a strong cast. Laura Parfitt’s Minnie, who proudly describes herself as “not a slag or a slapper”, has terrific guts and passion, and there is genuine tenderness in her relationship with Ben Thapa’s bad-guy-made-good Johnson.Music director John Gibbons realises Puccini’s sweeping score on the piano with panache, aided by a solo violinist, shamefully uncredited. Chevara’s English libretto, written with Kfir Yefet, is peppered with swearing and contemporary references – everything from Topshop to Spotify – that is well-calculated to appeal to newcomers but sensitive, too. The overall experience is marvellously uplifting, its emotional impact heightened by the intimacy of The King’s Head. The final scene will melt even the stoniest of hearts.

The latest, Dream Hunter, is a chamber opera written with librettist John Fuller. Commissioned by specialist contemporary music conductor Odaline de la Martinez, it was first produced last year in Wales. These are its first English performances.An atmospheric instrumental introduction instantly evokes the warm Corsican climes of the opera’s early 1900s setting, almost transcending the wintry draughtiness of Wilton’s Music Hall. The eerily entrancing mood, recalling the sinewy ambience of Britten works such as The Prodigal Son, is consistent throughout the 50 minute work – but the impact of the story, exploring the enforced seclusion of women in a male-dominated society, is hampered by paucity of dramatic drive. Of the four singers, Caryl Hughes makes the greatest impression as unambitious housewife Angela. Her beautifully sung soliloquy has a powerful sincerity which none of the others match. Charmian Bedford’s song-bird trilling is beguiling but, other than her vision-possessed frenzy, she has little presence. Brian Smith Walters lacks the hot-blooded charisma of womanising gambler Sampiero, most obviously in an incongruous Pavarotti parody. Musically, the singers are impressively assured in LeFanu’s gratefully lyrical lines.The most compelling theatrical experience of the evening comes from the excellent musicians of contemporary ensemble Lontano. Besides providing secure accompaniment, they display extrovert flair in the improvised elements of Annea Lockwood’s Monkey Trips – a short semi-staged work on Buddhist ideas which precedes the opera, demanding not just instrumental performance but movement and animal vocalisations from the players. It is brought off with a lively confidence that contrasts with the opera’s self-conscious restraint.

Richard Strauss wrote more grateful female roles than any other opera composer, and Rosenkavalier boasts three of his greatest – each sung superbly here. Amanda Roocroft, subtle, poignant and in beautiful voice, is perfect for the Marschallin – no other soprano today is better suited to the role. Sarah Connolly’s Octavian bounds with virile young passion, and Sophie Bevan’s effortlessly creamy top notes are to die for. They blend immaculately too, nowhere more so than in the heavenly final trio. Strauss’s failure to check the opera’s bloated length – its one major flaw – meant each was showing slight signs of tiredness by this stage, but this could not shake the emotional power of a sublime performance.McVicar does not overplay the piece’s comedy. The middle of Act 1 drags somewhat as a result, but the laughs in Acts 2 and 3 feel genuine. The understated approach, concentrating on bittersweet reflection, is rewarding. Key to its success is the superb acting abilities of the principal cast. The women deliver captivating, nuanced portrayals and John Tomlinson is a towering presence as the crass Baron Ochs – a plausible, even sympathetic, human being rather than buffoonish caricature. It is great to hear his cavernous velvet tones in relatively relaxed lyricism (rather than bellowing Wotan mode) – every word is clear.Edward Gardner’s idiomatic music direction conjures sumptuous sounds from the pit (the Act 2 waltz is deliciously swoony). McVicar’s own lavish set, which gently parodies 18th century opulence, satisfyingly compliments this emotionally engaging production.

He sang the role of cynical manipulator Don Alfonso in the staging’s first outing in 1995, and has returned several times in a part that has become entirely associated with him.Even with inevitably slightly diminished vocal resources these days, his remains a star-turn performance, searching out the corners of the ultimately enigmatic character and realising the mature philosopher with affectionate objectivity.He’s surrounded, on this occasion, by an immaculate cast. Malin Bystrom’s flighty Fiordiligi is nicely matched by the opulent tone and keen engagement of Michele Losier’s Dorabella. and Charles Castronovo’s elegantly sung Ferrando plays perfectly off Nikolay Borchev’s bullish Guglielmo, with the pair presenting the immature male obsessions of their heavy-metal fan disguises with effortless effrontery. Rosemary Joshua’s watchful, sharp-witted Despina is founded on pristine soprano tone and musical stylishness. Put them all together, and it’s hard to imagine a better or more finely co-ordinated cast.Much of the show’s success is down to the energy and intelligence with which Fehr has revived Miller’s original staging – surely one of the Royal Opera’s best-ever investments, which shifts and develops with each cast that inhabits it. More mellow than before, and perhaps a touch on the slow side, is Sir Colin Davis’ conducting, though it scarcely inhibits the wit and vitality of this classic staging.

For many years he planned an opera on the subject of Buddha called The Victors, though he never got around to composing it.He died in Venice on February 13, 1883, just after he had had a row with his wife, Cosima, about a young female singer who had appeared as a Flower Maiden in Parsifal the year before. To a libretto by Jean-Claude Carriere, Harvey’s work shows the row (Wagner and the other ‘real’ characters are represented by actors), the resulting heart attack, and then the composer dreaming his fully-sung opera in his last hour.Admittedly it doesn’t sound much like Wagner. Harvey’s score uses a varied medium-sized orchestra in what is a rich and colourful contemporary mix. Additional electronics provide subtlety and atmosphere.The vocal writing is simple and direct. That the result sometimes feels too static for real dramatic impact is due to the nature of the central story of Prakriti, the woman whom Buddha accepts as the first female member of his order.But Orpha Phelan’s staging is clear and economical, while both the speaking and singing casts do the piece justice under the skilled baton of Martyn Brabbins.

Instead, Alden updates. Sue Willmington’s costumes have a mid-19th century feel. The programme contains photos of the Amish community. The Romans, meanwhile, don the top hats and black suits of wealthy mill-owners.Charles Edward’s solid unit set is a vast wooden barn, with a gigantic tree trunk scored with pagan symbols occupying much of the floor space and rising, imposingly if alarmingly, to the roof. The specifics of the situation are unclear, but the look of the show is impressive.So is its dramatic thrust, even if – as often happens with Alden – some of the more extreme gestures go a little too far off the path of fidelity to the libretto to convince. Yet one is regularly bowled over by the power of a realisation as committed and charged with emotion as this.In her UK debut, Dutch soprano Annemarie Kremer burns with authentic fire as the priestess touched by the divine who sells her people and religion short through her illicit relationship with the Roman proconsul, Pollione. In the person of Mexican tenor Luis Chapa, he’s an unsubtle though sometimes potent presence. Keri Alkema matches Kremer note for note and gesture for gesture, while James Creswell is an empowered Oroveso. Oliver von Dohnanyi conducts a consistently exciting interpretation.

Cleopatra – joins Opera North’s repertoire in Tim Albery’s new production.Leslie Travers’ adaptable set first suggests a cut-off pyramid, and then reconfigures throughout the evening to represent various interiors and exteriors peopled by characters dressed in the costumes of later periods.Modern conflict is regularly referenced.After his defeat and murder in the ongoing battle with his wife and sister, Cleopatra, for the Egyptian throne, Ptolemy’s body is robbed of the golden finger extensions that symbolise his power, which his triumphant former consort/opponent immediately dons.Visually, it’s an often handsome show, enhanced by the variety and subtlety of Thomas C Hase’s lighting; and throughout, director Albery conveys the narrative with assurance.Musically, Robert Howarth’s conducting provides impetus if not quite enough emphasis or character. The singing is never less than solid but rarely more than that.Yet Sarah Tynan’s highly physical Cleopatra offers genuine sparkle, her sequence of arias the highlights of the evening.Pamela Helen Stephen impresses as a pensive, amorous Caesar, though is less successful at suggesting the Roman dictator’s military bearing. Kathryn Rudge is feisty as Sesto, the determined son of Caesar’s murdered rival Pompey. Ann Taylor is less striking as Pompey’s ever-grieving widow, Cornelia.James Laing offers a keenly etched portrayal of the treacherous, feline Ptolemy and Jonathan Best blusters effectively as the bullying Egyptian general Achilla.

Neither a provocative nor a deeply exploratory staging of the piece, its strengths lie in straightforward narrative values and some exceptional set pieces – the riot in Act II and the processional celebrations of Act III are brilliantly realised. It remains one of the director’s finest achievements.It’s a strong cast, too, even if Wolfgang Koch’s Hans Sachs and Peter Coleman-Wright’s Beckmesser seem, as yet, promising sketches rather than fully realised portrayals, but both artists sing impressively and Coleman-Wright builds up tremendous sympathy for the misery of the town clerk’s humiliation in the song contest.Simon O’Neill makes a vocally and physically solid Walther, his metallic but genuinely heroic tenor keeping pace with Wagner’s inordinate demands. Toby Spence challenges him for the tenorial honours as a David of soaring tone and impeccable youthful vitality – what a roll this artist is on the moment.Emma Bell’s lyricism is an asset as Eva, and, though there’s a lack of true radiance at the top of her soprano, she’s dramatically focused and intelligent. At her side, Heather Shipp offers a full-voiced Magdalene, not the usual second-string.Shining with warmth and humanity is John Tomlinson’s grandly sung Pogner, another exceptional portrayal from this magnificent artist.But the heroes of the evening are the Royal Opera Orchestra and Chorus, both on world-beating form, and music director Antonio Pappano, whose spacious reading has a richness and momentum that carry all before them.

Revival director Rodula Gaitanou ensures that everything happens neatly and clearly, and conductor Patrick Lange brings real distinction to the difficult task of minting the familiar score anew.There are also exceptionally good accounts of two of the three central roles. Piotr Beczala sings a radiant, musically scrupulous Alfredo; not many of today’s artists could come near his level of stylish lyric excellence.Equally fine is Simon Keenlyside’s thought-through Germont, the character’s hidebound nature revealed in the baritone’s careful attention to every detail of text, line and phrasing. Physically, too, he is right inside the role.Ailyn Perez’s Violetta is less even. Too often she tries to make Verdi’s notes more dramatic by adding special effects. It’s a counterproductive strategy and sometimes registers as merely mannered; Addio del passato is pulled around far too much. Despite that, her light-lyric soprano and overall dramatic stance are appealing, though they’re not quite on the level attained by her colleagues.Good work in the smaller roles, especially from Gaynor Keeble’s carefully observed Annina and Ji Hyun Kim’s lively Gastone. But the company needs to think about replacing this chocolate-box Traviata with something more searching.

Catherine Malfitano sang Tosca, and many other roles, at an international level – including in the live televised relay from Rome in 1992 that was seen, apparently, by one billion viewers. But her ENO staging of Tosca, revived from its initial production last year, remains an awkward realisation.Frank Philipp Schlossmann’s sets and Gideon Davey’s costumes, while presenting the opera in period – Rome in 1800 – begin uncertainly in Act 1, where Scarpia’s top-hatted spies (in church!) strike a sinister note, though an artificial one. By the time we reach Act 3, we’re staring at the Milky Way through the upturned barrel shape of the Castel Sant’Angelo, suggesting a spiritual dimension that removes the piece even further from its nihilistic premises. Throughout there’s a need for cleaner definition in the interaction of the central characters, who seem tepid when they should burn with heat.Yet there’s good vocal material on display, with Claire Rutter a tireless exponent of Puccini’s notes, which she delivers in the grand manner. Gwyn Hughes Jones’ Cavaradossi may be something of a physical lump and his voice less than Italianate, but there’s a steely power to his singing throughout. Anthony Michaels-Moore is more problematic as Scarpia, his bottom register weak and his characterisation neither suave nor truly menacing. That Puccini’s many musical coups de theatre nevertheless register is due to the dynamic and observant conducting of Stephen Lord, who draws the best from ENO’s orchestra.

A major success when it launched, Jo Davies’ production now seems more crisply defined than ever.John Wilson’s conducting is neat and pointed, with Opera North’s orchestra revealing the subtle refinements of Sullivan’s score. Davies’ staging, imaginatively designed by Richard Hudson and Gabrielle Dalton, places the action in a silent film frame and dashes through the dialogue while delivering it with precision. Kay Shepherd’s choreography is cleverly devised and perfectly executed.The cast is impeccable, giving due and equal value to Gilbert’s words and Sullivan’s notes. Amy Freston repeats her guileless Rose Maybud in a pure soprano with matchless diction. Grant Doyle’s shy Robin Oakapple transforms into an unwilling bad baronet with debonair ease. Heather Shipp’s blissfully unruly Mad Margaret is partially tamed by Richard Burkhard’s suavely supercilious Sir Despard Murgatroyd. Anne-Marie Owens brings grand vocal guns and a Geordie accent to bear on Dame Hannah. Steven Page is a mellifluous military martinet as Sir Roderic Murgatroyd. Hal Cazalet’s Dick Dauntless is manly nautical perfection.Indeed it is rare to see a production in which every member of the cast meets the highest standards and integrates so flawlessly into the overall dramatic momentum.

The music is by another immigrant artist, Belize-born Errollyn Wallen.The 70-minute work features nine singers, plus Greer narrating as herself, and a seven-piece ensemble. The title ‘Yes’ relates to Greer’s response, despite her initial uncertainty, to the invitation to appear on the programme. But ‘no’ is the answer we take away to the question the opera in fact asks, which is whether such a thing as pure Britishness exists.A breathlessly diffuse series of vignettes presents attitudes from a flurry of ordinary people representing both ‘sides’ of the argument – but these are cardboard characters expressed rather crudely: one laments “This isn’t the London I grew up in”, another notes, “It wouldn’t do if we were all alike”. A Muslim teacher of English history pops up recounting quickly tiring examples of invasions and waves of immigration over the past 2,000 years, which have contributed to our identity. But the kind of audience going to an opera exploring racial attitudes surely gets this. What we need is a more nuanced perspective. Then there are the striking but resolutely ‘either-or’ black and white stage designs.Sadly the musical diversity – taking in rock, gospel, musical theatre, a little electronic sound design – is not a harmonious one. And the often unintelligible singing tends to mask that Wallen writes well for voices.Greer may have made the right decision to appear on Question Time. But to funnel that experience into an opera? Maybe not.

Deborah Warner’s staging of Tchaikovsky’s most popular opera is broadly traditional, and much of it looks extremely handsome. The opening tableau of the third act, where the St Petersburg ballroom is invaded by guests dancing a polonaise, even gets a spontaneous round of applause.If one’s being picky, however, the dancing here and especially in the opening scene is too artfully contrived (by Kim Brandstrup) and executed for the contexts – neither of the groups involved is meant to consist of professional dancers. Something less polished would have fitted better.Set designer Tom Pye places the entire first act in a vast barn, where the eldest daughter of a well-off household apparently sleeps at night. The ball inside the Larin house, however, is beautifully imagined and Warner’s touch is largely sure, even if Amanda Echalaz’s Tatyana seems too restrained for a character burning with such intense inner passion.The singing is high quality. Echalaz’s heady soprano absolutely nails the Letter Scene, though she needs to beware of her voice rising above pitch later on. Toby Spence has done nothing finer than his convincingly acted and immaculately sung Lensky. Adrian Thompson almost challenges him with a superbly dignified cameo as Monsieur Triquet. Brindley Sherratt’s Prince Gremin is distinguished. Norwegian baritone Audun Iversen is impressive in the title role, if not quite magnetic enough to account for Tatyana’s coup de foudre.There is some wonderful playing from the orchestra and powerfully motivated conducting from Edward Gardner.

The director/designer’s set is imposing in its initial presentation of the wedding celebrations of Amina and Elvino in a function room, less so when the same space has to double as the Count’s private room where Amina sleepwalks to ignominy.It’s an opera for vocal virtuosos, of course – at least in the two main roles – so it’s a pity that the new Spanish tenor Celso Albelo’s Elvino is so rough-hewn and crude. He’s not much more than adequate in a role that requires a real tenore di grazia, like Juan Diego Florez, who sang it when the staging was new.Almost equally frustrating is the Amina of Cuban-American soprano Eglise Gutierrez. She has the notes, or pretty well all of them, but her voice consistently narrows and fades in tone at the top of the range where it needs to open out. Like Albelo she also encounters some pitching problems. Her trill comes and goes.But their occasional out-of-tune singing is as nothing compared to the Lisa of Elena Xanthoudakis, who sings most of her role alarmingly sharp.It’s left to the Italian bass Michele Pertusi’s Count Rodolfo to remind us what bel canto values really are. He founds his singing on a solid, pliable legato line that is far too often missing elsewhere. Frankly, from a vocal point of view, this is a seriously disappointing evening.Conductor Daniel Oren maintains fitful momentum in the pit.

Francis Ford Coppola relocated the book’s action to Vietnam and Cambodia for his Apocalypse Now (1979), but this operatic version stays close to Conrad’s original.Aboard a moored yacht in the Thames, Charles Marlow tells the story of his commission as a riverboat captain with a Belgian company and his journey along a river in Central Africa to find the ailing trader Kurtz, whose success in acquiring ivory is thought to be linked to unorthodox, even barbaric, methods. Kurtz expires on his passage home and, back in Europe, Marlow falsely reassures Kurtz’s fiancee that the shamanistic trader uttered her name with his last words.O’Regan and Phillips have created an atmospheric psychological drama – Phillips allowing himself to use only Conrad’s words, whether from the book or his navigational diaries – and both music and words to varying degrees throw up motifs, which occasionally expand to become mantras. Reflecting O’Regan’s transatlantic existence, his score references the anguished coiled chromatic vocal phrases of Benjamin Britten and the clean metrics of American minimalism, as well as including an exuberant dance to celebrate the arrival of vital, ship-repair-enabling rivets.Solidly conducted by Oliver Gooch, the ensemble CHROMA and the fine cast are firmly grounded by Alan Oke’s Marlow, whose clean expression suggests a captain who has lost something of his self through his African experience, and by Danish bass Morten Lassenius Kramp (Kurtz), who is as striking for his cavernous lower range as for his sculpted torso.

ENO also engages for the first time the controversial Australian director Barrie Kosky, soon to take up the post of director of the distinguished Komische Oper in Berlin.The result is nevertheless unfortunate. Kosky’s heavily interventionist style, in what the Germans call the Regietheater (director’s theatre) tradition, is a long way from the regular British text-based approach. The mythological plot tells of half-brothers Castor and Pollux, both in love with Telaire, who loves Castor, as does her sister Phebe. It is Phebe’s jealousy that brings about Castor’s death. Pollux decides to enter Hades to bring him back, but he must remain there in his place. Eventually Jupiter, touched by the half-brothers’ mutual devotion, turns Castor and Pollux into stars.Though it’s not hard to follow the main action – partly due to the clarity of Amanda Holden’s English translation – much of the extreme physicality of the staging seems overwrought, if not downright obscure. It’s a credit to the cast that they pursue this side of the show with such commitment, while not relinquishing their hold on vocal values.Little of the magic and fantasy of the original dramatic set up comes over in Katrin Lea Tag’s plain wooden set, however, and the sexual shenanigans prove tiresome. Christian Curnyn conducts a solid performance, though it could be tauter orchestrally. Allan Clayton’s forthright Castor, Sophie Bevan’s limpid Telaire and Roderick Williams’ articulate Pollux all excel.

A veritable operatic titan who can claim more than 130 roles to his credit, he is the only one of the original Three Tenors to have returned to a full-throttled operatic career.The final acts of three Verdi operas – Otello, Rigoletto and Simon Boccanegra – in theory present three very different dramatic figures – the Shakespearean Moorish general driven by misplaced jealousy to kill his wife, the humiliated and luckless court jester who is fiercely protective of his daughter, and the corsair turned doge whose political ascent runs in tandem with rebellion and family tragedy. It’s a selection which even affords Domingo two deaths in one evening.Domingo still cuts a strong figure on stage but, unsurprisingly, even he seemed challenged by throwing forward the characters’ back stories into intensified denouements. Vocally he is a marvel for his 70 years, though this particular selection gave him little chance to prove it.Among the colleagues appearing with him are Marina Poplavskaya, unconvincing as Desdemona (Otello), Francesco Meli – whose brilliant tenor is well-suited to the Duke of Mantua (Rigoletto) and Gabriele Adorno (Boccanegra), and Paata Burchuladze who sings the assassin Sparafucile (Rigoletto) but makes a bigger impression as a suitably aristocratic Jacopo Fiesco (Boccanegra).In the first of two performances, Antonio Pappano and the Royal Opera Orchestra could hardly pay greater homage in the pit, but Domingo was the centre of the evening, as was clear from the streams of flowers hurled onto the stage and the warm standing ovation.

Kandis Cook’s stark sets are atmospherically lit by Chris Davey, her lavish costumes moving the action forward to around the period of the opera’s premiere in 1890.Where it fails to convince is partly in the central vocal performances and partly in the dramatic engagement and interaction of the principals. Singing the role of the alienated, gambling-obsessed Herman is Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts – a fine artist who here sounds out of his vocal depth – a weightier tenor is needed. Soprano Orla Boylan sounds equally tentative as Lisa, the naive young woman Herman uses to find a way into the presence of the elderly Countess who holds the secret of the cards. Lloyd-Roberts and the matronly Boylan fail to connect with one another.This leaves the show in the hands of the secondary roles, one of them a standout. Dame Josephine Barstow’s Countess seizes every opportunity in sight. Instead of the usual vision of a helpless old lady, Barstow presents a figure still holding onto her glamour – svelte and alluring, she judges every gesture with immaculate artistry.As Herman’s noble fellow gamblers Tomsky and Yeletsky, Jonathan Summers and William Dazeley both make something out of their respective solos. Alexandra Sherman brings an almost contralto-like depth to Pauline.But it’s in the disciplined conducting of Richard Farnes and the nuanced playing of Opera North’s orchestra that Tchaikovsky’s thrilling score is most purposively conveyed.

It is an extraordinary achievement that, six decades later, and 23 years after Walsh’s death, Wexford continues to host a unique festival focusing on rare and unusual operas from different periods, staging them to the highest standards in the world-class Wexford Opera House, which opened in 2008.Artistic director David Agler – himself a gifted conductor – has devised a celebratory programme that continues to uphold Wexford’s finest traditions and has yet again drawn visitors from far and wide.First on the bill is the lightweight comedy La Cour de Celimene (Celimene’s Court), by the once famous 19th century French composer Ambroise Thomas – whose major operas Mignon and Hamlet have enjoyed successful international revivals over recent decades. Following its successful initial run in 1855, however, this particular example of Thomas’ charming, sophisticated output utterly vanished. But Stephen Barlow’s clever production, played in colourful designs by Paul Edwards, reveals it as an entirely viable if relatively slight piece. Wexford prides itself on introducing young and talented singers, and here Claudia Boyle, Nathalie Paulin, John Molloy and Luigi Boccia all make a highly positive impression in the central roles.The second opera, Maria, is more substantial. Its Polish composer, Roman Statkowski, has almost no reputation beyond his own country, and even there his 1906 opera has been rarely heard. Under conductor Tomasz Tokarczyk, Statkowski’s score registers as skilful and dramatically apt, though its strong resonances of earlier Russian composers such as Tchaikovsky and Mussorgsky tend to overwhelm its individuality. The production, by Michael Gieleta, moves the tragic action forward to the period when the union solidarity challenged Soviet-style communism’s hold on Poland – the result is a hard-hitting piece of theatre that makes an indelibly powerful impact. Memorable in the central roles are Daria Masiero, Rafal Bartminski, Adam Kruszewski and Krzysztof Szumanski, with tenor Bartminski a particularly exciting find.Donizetti has become the composer most frequently performed at Wexford, and his vast output still contains plenty of worthwhile pieces to choose from. This year’s programme is completed by the obscure comedy Gianni di Parigi, in which a Dauphin and his betrothed Princess, before their wedding, check each other out in a country inn – or here, in Tiziano Santi’s clever designs, an upmarket 1920s hotel. There’s not a great deal of plot, but the music is frequently delightful and goes with a swing under the baton of Giacomo Sagripanti. The cast – consisting of Zuzana Markova, Alessandro Luongo, Edgardo Rocha, Alessandro Spina, Fiona Murphy and Lucia Cirillo – are consistently impressive. The 2011 season proves to be a vintage one, with all three works well worth encountering as well as being performed in strong productions and with high-quality casts.

Michael Levine’s stark designs and Constance Hoffman’s modern costumes create an atmospheric opposition between the everyday banality that the heroine, Senta, longs to escape from, and the half-dream, half-nightmare world of the accursed seafaring Dutchman and his ghostly crew which eventually claims her.The vocal and dramatic performances are unusually strong. Kampe hurls herself at Senta’s demands with something close to abandon and a high rate of success. Egils Silins debuts with the company as the Dutchman, his sombre presence matching a vocal delivery notable for its heightened tension. Stephen Milling’s Daland evokes the banality of Senta’s venal father perfectly. As Erik, Senta’s cast-off admirer, Endrik Wottrich fights his corner with impressive resistance to the inevitable – many play the role as a wimp but here the Dutchman has a worthy adversary.There’s a big role for the chorus and the final scene’s confrontation between the local sailors and the ghastly spectres on board the Dutchman’s vessel is thrilling. There’s some fine orchestral playing, too, with conductor Jeffrey Tate displaying the abrasive quality of Wagner’s early orchestration and the pounding energy of his ideas. Some of the tempi, though, feel ponderous. More electricity is needed.The Royal Opera plays the piece in one long joined-up act – a version Wagner originally conceived but which was never performed during his lifetime. It’s justified here in an interpretation that grips right through to the final bars.

The strength of James Conway’s production for English Touring Opera, revived here from its successful 2009 original, is that it keeps its eye on the dramatic ball throughout. With good diction from a generally strong cast, the result is – crucially – easy to follow.Handel’s music – surprisingly inventive and memorable for what is a relatively neglected title – is delivered with vivid panache by the period-instrument orchestra, the recently formed Old Street Band. Conductor Jonathan Peter Kenny shows a keen ability to motivate the arias with character and keeps the momentum up during the recitatives. A lengthy show passes by speedily, with a constant sense of engagement and flow and with Joanna Parker’s colourful minimalist designs providing an attractive and effective background.Two cast indispositions were announced on the first night, but even so vocal standards were high. Mark Wilde impressed both with his poised acting as Ugone and his ability to get words across. Lina Markeby’s mezzo and Paula Sides’ soprano found good employment in their expressive accounts of Vitige and Emilia respectively. Kitty Whately’s Teodata shines with quality. Andrew Slater makes a purposive Lotario, and countertenors Clint van der Linde and Jake Arditti fight their respective corners as Flavio and Guido. Well worth catching as it tours up and down England during the autumn.

The problem with James Conway’s new English Touring Opera production, designed by Sarah Bacon, is that its period transfer doesn’t work.We are in an airfield, where King Xerxes – the recently crowned king – is admiring his new Spitfire. A Second World War ambience is suggested, with Elviro, servant to Xerxes’ brother Arsamenes, a black marketeer. There are references to Edward VIII – who was not, of course, king at the time of the war and of Spitfires. It’s an incoherent concept. There are some jokes in Bacon’s designs, and in Conway’s staging, though they seem strained and applied from without as opposed to deriving from the text and the characters.There are recompenses in the singing, which is regularly lively and sometimes accomplished. Mezzo Julia Riley has some particularly fine moments in the title role, and Clint van der Linde’s counter-tenor is well employed as Arsamenes. Laura Mitchell’s Romilda and Paula Sides’ Atalanta both make a strong showing.Best of all is conductor Jonathan Peter Kenny, who succeeds in energising and characterising Handel’s varied score to impressive effect, drawing vital playing from the period-instrument musicians of the Old Street Band in the pit.

She and her designer Julia Hansen keep the main action in period (the opera dates from 1843 and treats a contemporary situation) while using its choral interventions to bring in a watchful troupe of amused and bewigged 18th-century sophisticates – an audience dressed in white. The effect is stunning. But so is the clever use of the revolve to reveal elements of the plot developing in other corners of Don Pasquale’s home and elsewhere.Clement’s direction of the principals, too, shows acumen and resolve in exploring the story’s emotional undercurrents and even in inventing new ones – used as we are to seeing Ernesto and Norina as a thwarted couple triumphing over the former’s curmudgeonly uncle, it is a surprise to find Ernesto’s friend Malatesta involved with her, too, and apparently stealing her from him as his final trick in an evening of dangerous deception.Vocal and acting standards are both high in a staging that establishes the cleverness and complexity of a piece regularly played merely for laughs. Here Andrei Bondarenko’s suave, cynical Malatesta is a manipulative match for Don Alfonso in Mozart’s Cosi. Ainhoa Garmendia seems none too honourable, too, though her voice moves easily around the notes and she judges the tricky moment when she slaps old Pasquale carefully, as does the director herself. Enea Scala’s Ernesto is physically and vocally charming, Jonathan Veira an expert and deeply touching Pasquale, while conductor Enrique Mazzola brings spirit and vitality to every note.

It originally consisted of a substantial spoken drama – a version of Shakespeare’s Midsummer Night’s Dream – interspersed with masque-like sequences positioned at the ends of acts and incorporating singing, dancing and – one can be sure – some pretty expensive scenic effects. Back in 1692, it cost Dorset Garden Theatre £3000 to stage – more than £260,000 in today’s money.Obviously English Touring Opera’s budget doesn’t exist in a similar realm, though it stretches to a couple of aerialists and a pair of dancers, as well as a respectable pit band and eight principals. The mistake made is one that was understandable before Glyndebourne’s 2009 production by Jonathan Kent, which proved that if you do the entire show as Purcell conceived it – spoken dialogue and all – it works. Here, as in David Pountney’s 1995 staging for ENO, the musical sections are left stranded without context.Except that director Thomas Guthrie and his designer, the late Roger Butlin, add in a spurious connection to the 19th-century artist Richard Dadd, famed for his extraordinary fairy paintings, who ended his days in an asylum. It’s scarcely solid enough to convince as a concept, nor even particularly noticeable.That said, there’s enough decent singing and playing to make what we hear enjoyable. Purcell’s score is consistently inventive and it’s adequately served. But following Glyndebourne’s staging and Graham Vick’s King Arthur for the Royal Opera, which also delivered the full text, half the show no longer seems enough.

Unfortunately the trick does not work third time around.Shaw’s designer, Peter McKintosh, produces a colourless, antiseptic set of mazes where the complex action plays out. The period is vague – 18th-century elements mingle with much more recent appurtenances. A bigger problem is that Shaw’s direction lacks the specifics of moment-by-moment action and interaction such comedies depend on. The garden scene feels like a sketch rather than an achieved piece of work.Given this background, it’s perhaps not surprising that individual performances lack spark, and the cast were probably not helped on the first night by the late replacement of the announced Countess by another singer. Yet stepping into this challenging assignment, Elizabeth Llewellyn undoubtedly took the evening’s vocal laurels – her rich, creamy soprano was superbly managed and deserves to take her far. Iain Paterson’s Figaro delivered a fine Act 4 aria, as did Devon Guthrie’s Susanna with her serenade. But elsewhere he made a dull thing out of a star role while she appeared fraught in a part that is all about vivacity.Roland Wood’s Count is monochromatically angry, and Jonathan Best’s baritonal Bartolo needs a stronger lower register. Lucy Schaufer’s Marcellina at least offers energy. It’s a disappointing evening, too, from conductor Paul Daniel, with the recitatives lacking momentum, though ENO’s orchestra, as usual, plays well.

Bach certainly never intended his great Passion setting to be staged – Goodwin argues that the production has evolved out of the vibrant music, opera in all but name. A major benefit is to lift the score out of the over-reverential piety in which many church and concert hall performances are mired. Forced to abandon the comfort-blanket of printed pages, the singers engage fully with the audience, bringing the music vividly to life.Goodwin’s conducting is superbly paced – taut crowd scenes bristle with energy and intimate chorales have a spine-tingling intensity (credit to the student chorus of the Guildhall School). The young musicians of Southbank Sinfonia excel, playing on modern instruments with the stylish buoyancy of period bands. All that prevents it from being a great musical performance is the generally undistinguished vocal quality of the soloists. Most impressive is Andrew Staples, sailing through the Evangelist’s notoriously tricky lines with apparent ease and terrific dramatic involvement. Like the other singers and instrumentalists, however, Staples is helped by artificial amplification – an inevitable flaw in Miller’s ‘in the round’ concept that fatally undermines any aspiration to natural communication in a large auditorium, and shows little respect for Bach.More disappointingly, Miller’s staging is simply a dramatisation of the bible account of Christ’s last days on earth, missing the opportunity to explore a contemporary relevance or wider spirituality. Theatrically underwhelming, thanks to Goodwin the production is musically strong enough to ensure a rewarding experience.

Everything about the history of The Passenger is extraordinary. The libretto derives from a novel by the Polish writer Zofia Posmysz, who was sent to Auschwitz in 1943 yet managed to come out alive. Himself born in Poland in 1919, the Jewish Weinberg fled to Russia to escape the Nazis while the rest of his family vanished into the camps. Though befriended by Shostakovich, his career in Russia never flourished. Completed in 1968, his opera based on Pomysz’s partly autobiographical story had to wait until the 2010 Bregenz Festival for its first, posthumous staging.Set partly on an ocean liner in the sixties, and partly in wartime Auschwitz, the opera describes how Liese Franz, a former SS overseer with a new life, encounters Marta, a former camp inmate, on board ship. As we re-enter the horrific past, Liese and her husband are forced to revaluate everything. The result, in Pountney’s highly charged, two-level staging, provides a bleak yet potent visual experience.Weinberg’s score shows the influences of Shostakovich and Britten. It has moments of great impact, vividly brought out under conductor Richard Armstrong, though as the UK’s other major Weinberg premiere of the year, Opera North’s The Portrait, also showed, his music is inconsistent in quality. But the cast, led by Michelle Breedt’s tireless Liese and Giselle Allen’s committed Marta, give it their all. In the evening’s final extraordinary gesture, 88-year-old Posmysz herself is acclaimed at her curtain-call.

Indeed, McVicar and his designers (sets by Charles Edwards, costumes by Brigitte Reiffenstuel), plus choreographer Michael Keegan-Dolan, keep us royally entertained for nigh on four hours. The basic premise of the composer himself being torn between the wicked stage and his religion may stand little scrutiny, but Faust played as an upmarket West End musical can still be enjoyable.Particularly when sung, as here, by an all-star cast. Yet as usual with Angela Gheorghiu, there’s a sense of frustration with her Marguerite. So much talent, so fine a voice, but she coasts through much of the role, both vocally and dramatically, when she could win an artistic triumph. Its ingenue character doesn’t come naturally to her.Nor does Rene Pape’s Mephistopheles field the personality and humour such a star part demands – though once again there’s no gainsaying the magnificence of the voice per se.Where the individual performers strike home are in Dmitri Hvorostovsky’s thrillingly sung and finely acted Valentin – his breath control amazing, the small cadenza he adds to “Avant de quitter ces lieux” a distinctive personal touch – and in Vittorio Grigolo’s Faust. A fireball of energy, the young Italian tenor is a genuine star, vocally graceful yet exciting and dramatically vivid.Michele Losier is a winsome Siebel, Carole Wilson makes a tasty meal of Dame Marthe and Evelino Pido conducts efficiently.

Based on folk sources, Mae Naak is a ghost story about a soldier, Maak, who has left his wife and son at home, spending years in battle. At the end of the war he returns home, where his house is a ruin. But he sees it as it was, and his wife Mae Naak and son as they were before he went away. In reality they are dead. Vampire-like, Mae Naak is able to simulate life and kill her enemies. Only at the end is the terrible truth revealed.Somtow Sucharitkul is not just a composer but also an author of gothic fantasy and horror fiction. He has worked as a filmmaker too, and it is easy to see how well this plot could adapt to the screen. Unfortunately, neither Stefan Sanchez’ rudimentary staging nor Somtow’s score – which borrows heavily from romantic opera composers such as Puccini, Richard Strauss and even Gounod, adding in a sprinkling of authentic Thai effects and film-score melodramatics – is able to realise its potential.There are some worthwhile things in the show. Striking is the baritone of Kyu Won Han, whose Maak has genuine dignity and presence. High-flying soprano Nancy Yuen impresses with her top register as Mae Naak. Best of all is the committed playing of the mainly young musicians of the Siam Philharmonic Orchestra, and the perfect control obtained by conductor Trisdee na Patalung.

This production brings together three of the award-winning team behind Les Miserables – director John Caird, designer John Napier and lighting designer David Hersey. The trio have created an impressively oppressive mood that’s perfect for Mozart’s darkly intense, flawed masterpiece. Taking inspiration from Rodin’s The Gates of Hell, the ominous sculptural set is the grand star of the show, the ornate bronze panels of writhing bodies both lustful and entombed. These pivoting panels act as a constant and theatrical reminder that, beneath the surface amusements of Don Giovanni’s womanising, lies the suffering of his victims and a threat of eternal damnation.Yet despite the dark undertones of rape and murder, WNO have excelled in bringing the comic energy of this popular two-act drama to life without descending into pantomime farce. David Soar can take much of the credit for this, playing the charmingly convincing Leporello, Giovanni’s hard-done-by servant. The predominantly young cast seem to take a while to get into their stride in Act I but, once they have, they pull it together well. Making both his Mozart and Don Giovanni debut, David Kempster is believably potent as a wanton hedonist, if lacking in devilish fire, while Wrexham’s Camilla Roberts is assured as the vengeful and devastated Donna Anna.Keeping to traditional time and setting, John Napier and Yoon Bae have created refreshingly simple yet visually arresting costumes, from the sculpted, hooded demon forms to the floaty wedding party and the creepily statuesque Commendatore (Carlo Malinverno).

Revival director Elaine Tyler-Hall does an impressive job in maintaining the vitality and humanity of last year’s original, while Kelley Rourke’s smart and sassy translation balances fidelity to the Italian text with a nice US period-feel and all the appropriate accents.The cast is first-rate. Sarah Tynan’s blond bombshell of an Adina comes over as proud and superior, though she melts beautifully as her character steadily registers the genuineness of her lovelorn admirer’s affections. She sings with consistent precision and point.Initially dressed as a scuzzy, unshaven mechanic, rising young tenor Ben Johnson’s Nemorino smartens up his act when competition turns up in the shape of Benedict Nelson’s hunky, cocksure Sergeant Belcore. Johnson sings with distinction, shaping Donizetti’s lines impeccably and holding the house spellbound with his hit number, Una furtiva lagrima. Nelson is perfect casting as the bumptious soldier and sings with vigour and panache. The central quartet is completed by the experienced Andrew Shore in the role of the quack doctor, Dulcamara – once again his stylish command of text and physicality combine to produce a finely judged performance.In the pit, another talented young artist – conductor Rory Macdonald – impresses with the fluency and bounce he brings to the melodious bel canto score.

The dark melodrama of Il tabarro is set in the period of Puccini’s score (all three works were premiered in 1918) and deals with the broken relationship between saturnine bargee Lucio Gallo and his wife Giorgetta, presented with passionate engagement by Eva-Maria Westbroek, and her doomed romance with Aleksandrs Antonenko’s striking young lover Luigi.Suor Angelica takes place in a children’s infirmary in a convent, where the desperate Angelica eventually takes her own life on receiving the news of her child’s death in the outside world. Ermonela Jaho’s Angelica, arguably a vocal size too small for the role at Covent Garden, is nevertheless intensely moving as the tragic nun, but allows herself to become dangerously involved with the piece’s heady emotional power. As her unfeeling Aunt, Anna Larsson’s twitchy, full-voiced presentation is memorable.Tears are wiped away by the mordant comedy Gianni Schicchi, in which Richard Jones’ direction is at its most astute. Francesco Demuro and Ekaterina Siurina are a delight as the young lovers, with Gallo returning in triumph as a sexy, savvy Schicchi.

If the performances are theatrically vigorous under Oliver Mears’ adventurous direction, every word is clear. Even for Gavan Ring’s lecherous Aristaeus – Eurydice’s lover and Pluto’s earthly incarnation, who is reimagined as a personal trainer – whose aria expressing his prowess literally comes at its climax, without missing a beat or losing a word.This is an inventive rather than X-rated staging, however – even during the magnificent grand opera-style seduction aria between Brendan Collins’ Jupiter, in bondage-tight PVC fly costume, and Jane Harrington’s Essex girl Eurydice. Simon Holdsworth’s set is dominated by the front covers of red-top newspapers and celebrity magazines and his costumes allude to raunch – Diana’s jodhpurs and riding crop – rather than displaying it.The strong cast do Offenbach’s music all the favours it deserves, with no let-downs. It all builds easily from the early Mozart-style duet, flitting back and forth between Nicholas Sharratt’s upper-crust Orpheus and Eurydice. Yet for all the clarity and invention, the lack of an orchestra and chorus makes it all feel a little thin.

In this economical staging designed by Simon Banham and directed by Michael McCarthy, it reasserts its position as a contemporary classic.Berkoff’s vivid text, cut and adapted by the composer and Jonathan Moore, gives us an often foul-mouthed but always energised text placing the central character, Eddy, at the heart of cockney London, where his putative parents fall into line with the prejudices of the Thatcherite period. Though the story largely sticks to the original, its late 20th century twists and turns are both convincing and fascinating, so too are the libretto’s occasional moves into something resembling Shakespearean blank verse.But what stops the work feeling like a period piece is the power and pungency of Turnage’s consistently inventive score, a tour de force of stylistic mixes and matches carried off with brilliance. It is hard not to feel that it’s at least as good as any of his subsequent operas, as well as being sharper and shorter.Michael Rafferty conducts a tip-top performance with no weak links and a virtuoso orchestra – the latter required to do far more than just play their instruments. Marcus Farnsworth’s Eddy is dark, dangerous yet strangely likeable, while the versatile trio of Sally Silver, Louise Winter and Gwion Thomas double and triple up in all the other parts. Definitely a show to catch on its autumn tour.

It is an epic tale of the mythical Babylonian queen, who is to announce her new king following her husband’s death 15 years before. She little knows that in rejecting palace favourite Assur (Josef Wagner) for the young commander Arsace (Hadar Halevy in the trousers role), she is not just spurning her collaborator in her husband’s murder, she is also taking her own son to her side.If Rossini gives his performers a wide-ranging platform from which to showcase all their vocal skills in depicting love, madness and despotic power, director Nigel Lowery does not. His set, using the projection of a collapsed Victorian ballroom as its main focus, fails to help the plot. A vast box, the height of the stage and wheeled on by clearly visible technicians with winking red lights on their headsets, doesn’t evoke a temple, but the back of a scenery flat.Conductor Alberto Zedda brings out plenty of texture from the Vlaamse Opera Orchestra, although he does sacrifice a certain amount of crispness along the way. Despite the obstacles, the principals succeed in conveying the twists and turns of the plot, echoing in it their emotional development. If they are ably supported by a large and well-used chorus, the whole still provokes inappropriate laughter.

To a high-falutin libretto by his regular collaborator Hugo von Hofmannsthal, The Woman without a Shadow is Strauss’ most ambitious score.The fairy tale world of the Arabian nights provides the background to a symbolic tale in which gaining a shadow equals child-bearing, equals personal fulfilment and responsibility to humanity. That might be arguable, and so – frankly – is the quality of the opera itself. For hard-core Strauss fans, it’s his ultimate achievement – though they might acknowledge the odd flaw. For his detractors, it’s overblown, pretentious and almost unbearable.At any rate it’s an almighty challenge, which this staging, designed by Paul Brown and here revived by Lloyd Wood, partially succeeds in realising.  Strangely, it’s the opulent and traditional Eastern fairy tale sequences, overlain with repetitive video projections, which seem static and even corny, whereas the contemporary visuals of tumble-dryers and TVs ensure that the all-too human home life of the dyer Barak, his brothers and his unhappy wife comes over vividly.The singers are a decent bunch who get through some seriously demanding roles with credit. Edem Umerov is warm and likeable as Barak, Olga Sergeyeva dramatically fractious and vocally trenchant as his wife. Both the Emperor (Viktor Lutsiuk) and Empress (Mlada Khudolei) emerge largely unscathed, she with some shine on the tone. Conductor Valery Gergiev leads a performance in which the score is all present and correct, though it has some rough edges.

Mozart’s Don Giovanni gets not only a new English libretto by Robin Norton-Hale – who also directs – but also a live electronic score by Harry Blake, who introduces orchestral Mozart samples as well as dubstep and techno elements played on his laptop while seated on stage next to pianist Emily Leather, who provides the more traditional musical accompaniment.The insatiable lothario Don Giovanni (here, Johnny) is cast as a thrill-seeking, pre-credit crunch banker – his servant Leporello (Alexander) as his intern. Marc Callahan and Tom Stoddart give strong performances respectively in these roles – Callahan especially so with impressive vocal stamina and no let up in the sleazy arrogance commensurate with his salary. Indeed, the singing overall is good – Emily-Jane Thomas’s Zerlina also standing out, although Fleur Bray’s Anna occasionally sounded tired in the upper reaches.There’s no sense of deliberate nose-thumbing at Mozart but, although Leather manages to bond to the singers, there’s little sense of the music driving the drama. If Mozart were alive, he may well approve of an electronic underlay to parts of his score, to video projections and to the reframing of the action – but, even if he’d sanctioned the (mostly well-executed) cuts, he surely couldn’t accept this particular kind of emasculation. There’s a fund of ideas here, then, and some good performances but when the most sublime arias are made to appear twee in context, the score’s importance is inevitably in freefall.

Illness put pay to Grimeborn’s Philip Glass premiere at the Arcola and not everything in Tete a Tete’s bittier creative seedbed for new work has emerged unscathed. The range of material on offer in almost three weeks of loosely ‘operatic’ performance is nevertheless dazzling, from risque cabaret that turns to al fresco song cycles to events designed to introduce toddlers to live music theatre. More serious high art projects also feature – some bite-size, some bigger, all at £6 a throw.In this context the sheer coherence of Michael Zev Gordon’s work-in-progress, a concise modern-dress Icarus, appears almost anachronistic. Written to a libretto by Stephen Plaice, who has performed similar services for Harrison Birtwistle, the one act presented finds master craftsman Daedalus struggling to teach Icarus the art of the smithy while his nephew Talus presses ahead with risky man-powered flight. Gordon’s perky, lyrical score deploys accordion and marimba within Chroma’s small ensemble of eight. Don’t expect Birtwistle’s high modernism – nor, incidentally, should the London-born composer be confused with a noisier American post-Andriessen minimalist similarly named. The staging, punningly taking the protagonists back to the drawing board, is devised by the festival’s artistic director Bill Bankes-Jones. The quartet of young singers strikes sparks.In place of a promised Conor Mitchell/Mark Ravenhill collaboration, New World (music by Samuel Bordoli to a Ravenhill text), satirises Apocalyptism, while Mitchell’s own Songs for Jean McConville, dedicated to the memory of a victim of IRA violence, turns out to be an unorchestrated requiem mass. That its performers (soprano Rebecca Caine and pianist James Longford) appear without shoes would seem the sole concession to theatricality. First off a free event in the foyer – an Aesopian Lite Bite from Charlotte Bray melding basic puppetry, allusions to Mozart and insistent references to cheese. The season runs until August 21.

With its visuals moved to the time of the work’s composition in the early fifties, it exerts its dark fascination with palpable power.Lit subtly by Mark Henderson, Paul Brown’s designs create atmospheric interiors and exteriors in which the imagination of Miah Persson’s Governess senses evil at work. The work’s fast-moving scene changes are brilliantly realised as sets move up and down or swing round on a revolve. Technically, the evening runs immaculately.As it does on other levels, too. Persson’s Governess is flawlessly voiced, her words keenly articulated, the ambiguity of her character – determined saviour of the children in her care, or a fantasist steadily falling apart? – is maintained right to the close. Toby Spence’s Prologue and Peter Quint are sung with mellow tonal beauty and realised with comprehensive physical control. Giselle Allen’s Gothic Miss Jessel is an angry presence. Susan Bickley’s Mrs Grose is utterly real as a sensible woman increasingly out of her depth.Assured, too, are the two children – dauntingly difficult roles both from a musical and a dramatic point of view, and superbly executed here. Thomas Parfitt’s gently luminous treble shines in a performance demonstrating an ideal blend of vulnerability and wise beyond his years knowingness. Joanna Songi’s spirited Flora is vital and perceptive.In the pit, Glyndebourne on Tour’s Czech music director Jakub Hrusa secures an account notable for intricate detail and momentum. Altogether one of the festival’s finest current productions.

Yet unlike several other current stagings, it doesn’t attempt merely to stick a new story over the old familiar one.What is more, the opera is evenly and largely successfully cast, though at this performance Robert Dean Smith’s hitherto ample tenor more or less packed up on him in the final act. After a difficult period, he regained some tonal poise, though one worries about how he proposes to get through the remaining performances.Far more consistent, and indeed impressive, was the Isolde of Irene Theorin, who was strong and free in tone throughout. At the age of 64, Robert Holl’s voice has lost some tension, but it’s still a grand and characterful instrument that he deploys to powerful effect as King Mark. Jukka Rasilainen’s burly Kurwenal and Michelle Breedt’s fluid Brangane are also major assets, while Ralf Lukas makes his interventions as Melot memorable.Long-term Bayreuth institution Peter Schneider is in the pit. While he’s no star presence – as some of his colleagues this season undoubtedly are – his sympathy with and understanding of Wagner’s music are clear throughout what is one of the season’s best paced and most finely controlled performances, with the orchestra on shining form.

Four years on, its potential to dismay not just Wagnerian traditionalists is still evident in the hefty booing that greets her curtain call.Set at the time of the sixties student revolts, it presents Walther as a loutish iconoclast who spends much of Act One defacing musical instruments or works of art. The location is an academy centred on the visual arts, not music. Beckmesser sings his song without an instrument in his hands, while Hans Sachs’ hammering on his cobbler’s last is feebly replaced by the clattering of typewriter keys. The tendency of the production, as of other recent Bayreuth stagings, seems to be to debunk Wagner with a level of ironic detachment bordering on mockery.Unsurprisingly, his mighty music drama cannot take such treatment to the degree that Katharina Wagner doles it out. The result is vacuous, hurling visual inanity into a garish mix that rarely engages with the genuine depth of the work itself.Once again the singing is not in the league one expects of a major international festival. James Rutherford’s Sachs is as yet a sketch, voiced in a kind of Bryn-Terfel-lite manner. Adrian Erod’s Beckmesser is a cipher. Burkhard Fritz’s Walther is roughly sung, while Michaela Kaune’s Eva is awkward both vocally and physically. But Georg Zeppenfeld’s Pogner cuts through. Sebastian Weigle’s conducting is prosaic.Only the mighty, 180-strong Bayreuth chorus and superb orchestra realise the standards Bayreuth once consistently aspired to.

Purely in terms of stagecraft, its presentation of the work as a history of the festival is regularly visually compelling. Herheim and his designers Heike Scheele and Gesine Volim lay a second narrative over the original that focuses on Villa Wahnfried, Wagner’s Bayreuth home. But the story of the house’s inhabitants – members of Wagner’s family and their close associates in different eras – is a narrower one than the myth with many meanings Wagner retells in his libretto. From difficult family relationships in Act I we move onto Bayreuth’s engagement with the Third Reich in Act II, where a group of (presumably) Jewish refugees watches Kundry’s attempted seduction of Parsifal. The production is at its finest in the third act, which sticks closest to the original and where mirror images of the audience remind us of our ongoing participation in the Wagner cult.Musically, this is another fairly ordinary evening by top opera-house standards. Simon O’Neill registers as a solid exponent of the title role even while looking faintly ridiculous in a sailor suit. Kwangchul Youn is a worthy rather than a memorable Gurnemanz, Susan Maclean a striking if strident Kundry. Detlef Roth’s Amfortas is all present and correct but underpowered. Conductor Daniele Gatti secures a serviceable performance, though once again the bigger picture tends to get lost in his sectional approach. The chorus and orchestra are once again top of the range.

At times obscure in narrative values, yet without any sense of mystery, the show’s overall aim seems to consist in subverting Wagnerian grandeur and emotional depth by an ironic, at times deliberately comic, undercutting.Though the presentation of the chorus as rats – either black, white or (particularly in the wedding scene) pink – may arguably be intended to depict the herd instinct of groups of citizens at its most base, there’s an element of satire or pure send-up here that nevertheless allows itself moments of Disney-like cuteness. The chorus is hardly the most important element in Lohengrin, but here their rodent mannerisms upstage everyone and everything else. The piece is reduced to cartoon-strip triviality.It would be nice to report that Wagner’s music triumphs nevertheless, but in this undercast edition it doesn’t. Soprano Astrid Weber sings above and below the note as Elsa, rarely on it. She audibly struggles, as does Tomas Tomasson’s rough-hewn Telramund, whose uneven baritone nearly fails him at a couple of points. Klaus Florian Vogt makes nice sounds in the title role, but the role is a size too big for him. The strain is revealed in the last act, where he is otherwise, if only intermittently, at his best.Only Petra Lang’s regal and authoritative Ortrud sets the Wagnerian pulses racing and shows the vocal level the festival should be aiming at. Even talented conductor Andris Nelsons delivers less excitement than he should, though his textures are impeccably clear.

Unfortunately, in Nina von Mechow’s costumes its inmates look like escapees from a cheap touring production of The Lion King.Despite the show’s technical brilliance and expensive stagecraft, Baumgarten’s analogy with Wagner’s conflict of spiritual and sexual love feels strained and unconvincing. Certainly if the amount of booing it received at this performance was anything to go by, the audience appeared to think so, though such reactions are far from rare at Bayreuth.Higher altogether are the musical and vocal values, with conductor Thomas Hengelbrock – best known as a Baroque specialist – showing a fine grasp of pacing in this smoothly running performance, with the festival’s legendary orchestra and chorus on excellent form.Swedish tenor Lars Cleveman works hard at the arduous title role, and not without success, even though he hardly stamps his personality on it. Camilla Nylund’s Elisabeth, however, is near ideal, though Stephanie Friede’s Venus is compromised by wobbly tone. Michael Nagy is an impressive Wolfram, Gunther Groissbock a stunning Landgrave.

Like Puccini he came from Lucca, where he was born just four years earlier. Puccini had his first major success in 1893 and went on to enjoy a prolific international career; following his early death Catalani was largely forgotten apart from the occasional revival of his final work. But this production shows it to possess real distinction.The story is set in the Austrian mountains, where the spirited Wally is loved by Gellner, whom she rejects, and obsessed instead with Hagenbach, who seems hostile to her. Trying to arrange his murder by his rival, she fails. She retreats to the high Alps where the two eventually admit their love for one another before dying in an avalanche.Jamie Vartan’s simple designs manage to suggest one of the most spectacular endings in opera on a limited budget and Martin Lloyd-Evans’ staging keeps the narrative well defined. In Gweneth-Ann Jeffers Opera Holland Park offers a vocal heroine of strength and purpose as well as lyricism – the latter well displayed in the opera’s only well-known aria, Ebben! Ne andro lontana, used in the film Diva and countless adverts. Stephen Gadd sounds stressed as Gellner but Adrian Dwyer is a redoubtable Hagenbach.Conductor Peter Robinson marshals his forces with alacrity and shows a keen appreciation of the music’s cogent originality and sparer, less obviously theatrical qualities.

Tom Scutt’s clever designs employ two sizable containers labelled Italia to conjure up the varied interiors and exteriors of a world of seedy, sexually-focused corruption not far from the ‘bunga-bunga’ parties of Silvio Berlusconi and his political cronies.Lindsay Posner’s tight direction provides finely attuned central performances, with some exemplary work from the chorus, who are in ringing voice. Only the appearance of Gilda as an angelic presence singing from beyond the grave while her father cradles her body in a sack proves debatable. Elsewhere the audience is gripped from start to finish.Especially with such marvellous singing on display. At the evening’s centre, Robert Poulton’s tireless Rigoletto is a tremendous achievement. Verdi believed Victor Hugo’s original creation of the jester whose plan for revenge goes horribly wrong to be Shakespearean in its complexity, and his setting of the result remains the single most demanding baritone role in the entire Italian repertory. Poulton’s imaginative command of vocal colour and power is beautifully judged.As the innocent Gilda – her father’s victim as much as the Duke’s – Julia Sporsen’s fleshy soprano manages all the notes and maintains intensity with its expressive power. A little pinched at the top, Jaewoo Kim’s Duke is nevertheless stylishly voiced and he convinces entirely as the compulsive womaniser. Graeme Broadbent’s baleful Sparafucile and Patricia Orr’s slinky Maddalena are top quality, while Stuart Stratford’s observant conducting draws consistent attention to the greatness of Verdi’s score.

Between 1998 and 2002 it tackled The Ring in a slimmed-down version. Now it is more than halfway through building up the largest repertoire challenge in a full-length, full-scale edition. Country house opera doesn’t come more ambitious than this.What is remarkable about this year’s Siegfried, the third section of the cycle, is just how much is achieved. The 66-piece orchestra, conducted with authority by Anthony Negus, rises ever more confidently to the challenge and is regularly superb.Alan Privett’s staging, designed by the Norwegian artist Kjell Torriset, has some sparse, limited sections – the three additional actors, dressed like stage attendants in a Noh production, can seem intrusive. Yet scene after the scene realises the essential meaning of the work in a semi-traditional, simple way. The entire third act is a triumph.Vocally, too, this is a remarkable evening. The young American tenor Daniel Brenna looks and acts the callow hero impressively and his tone remains convincing to the close. British soprano Alwyn Mellor adds further to her Wagnerian reputation with her confident Brunnhilde. Phillip Joll’s tone may be wavering around the notes these days but he supplies commanding presence and solidity. Nicholas Folwell makes a striking Alberich, Evelyn Krahe a resplendent Erda and Allison Bell a delightfully fresh Woodbird. The overall impression is distinguished. Next year it’s on to the final section – Gotterdammerung. British Wagner fans will need to be there.

Nymphs with long white swishing tails descend from the flies and, by accident rather than design, we’ve a real bat.A gaudier, vaguely contemporary terrestrial reality is encountered in the second act, the narrative clearly communicated until the third, when sexed-up, woolly-jumpered wood nymphs turn bafflingly violent.With the allure and threat of adolescent sexuality never far away, it helps that the leads are taken by young singers. Russian-born Dina Kuznetsova brings a fresh timbre and some physical credibility to a central role often associated with the creamy emoting of more mature sopranos. Pavel Cernoch, the one Czech singer in the cast of Glyndebourne Touring Opera’s Jenufa in 2009, is ardently authentic as Rusalka’s earthly Prince. Also new to the production is Andrew Davis, Glyndebourne’s music director from 1989 to 2000 – the players sound pleased to have him back.The score’s emotional intensity can anticipate Janacek and Dvorak’s own tender divided strings, and distinctive use of cor anglais are wonderfully well caught.Russian returnees from 2009 include the distinguished mezzo Larissa Diadkova as world-weary witch/babushka Jezibaba, and noble-sounding Mischa Schelomianski as water goblin Vodnik.

The cast represents a group of angels fallen from the sky to earth. But they also double as caricatured characters – a King, a Queen, a Prince, an Industrialist and others – in a heavily parodied fable of contemporary society’s greed and misuse of the world’s finite resources. Many will see this as a timely warning – patrons can sign a Friends of the Earth petition in the foyer. But there’s a clear mismatch between the complexities of Bedford’s score, which is regularly vital and imaginative, and the crude cartooning of Maxwell’s scenario – at times the result feels like a piece of political theatre for six-year-olds set to music written by an adult for other adults.Despite committed performances from everyone involved, and the expert playing of the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group under conductor Nicholas Collon, Fulljames’s production cannot resolve this conflict. Tadasu Takamine’s set consists of books standing in circles, some of which collapse before their cue as the audience enters – a foreseeable enough event to count as a design fault. But it’s the glib right-on-ness of Maxwell’s approach that ensures that the piece sinks under the weight of its own insufferable worthiness.

Like many amateur opera groups, Blackheath Halls Community Opera hires professional directors and principal singers, filling smaller roles and bumping the orchestra with music students. But what makes it special is its embracing community involvement, working closely with local primary schools and special needs schools – not just preparing for performances (around 40 children and young people take part each night), but also on classroom exploration of opera (colourful artwork is displayed in the Halls foyer).With its large crowd scenes and easy to follow (and relate to) love-tangle plot, Eugene Onegin proves an ideal follow-up to previous productions including Carmen. Director Harry Fehr transfers the action to fifties Corn Belt USA, allowing for ebullient Oklahoma!-esque chorus contributions. The Victorian hall space is used imaginatively – with audience seats along the walls and on the stage proper, the action mostly takes place on the expanse of central floor. When the hall first fills with the 100-odd bodies of enthusiastic-voiced (if female-heavy) adults and lively children, the effect is overwhelmingly joyous.Nicholas Jenkins has drilled the chorus well and coaxes sympathetic accompaniment from the orchestra, although inevitably the string section lacks oomph in the big moments. The professional cast is headed by Kate Valentine’s Tanya, radiant with optimistic innocence in the ‘letter scene’, and Nicholas Sharrat’s tortured Lensky, with a splendidly resonant Act III aria from bass Andrew Greenan.It is an enjoyable audience experience – but it is the looks of pride and delight on the faces of the cast, particularly the young people, during the curtain calls which speak volumes about the immeasurably positive effects of opera.

Like his Hamlet, which disappeared for decades even in France before renewing its reputation with an important revival in Buxton in 1980, Mignon takes a literary classic – in this case a Romantic novel by Goethe – and provides it with an attractive and viable stage treatment. On the way, the gifted composer offers an abundance of melodious and theatrically apt arias, ensembles and choruses – they are wonderfully realised here by a consistently talented cast under the spirited baton of Andrew Greenwood, who delivers the score with immense charm.Designer Nicky Shaw’s attractive costumes have a smart twenties look. She also comes up with an imaginative sequence of interiors and exteriors, beginning with the backstage confusion of the opening scene, where the louche, happy-go-lucky collection of characters begins its strange journey into the mystery of Mignon’s past – even the burning theatre that brings down the Act II curtain is convincingly realised. Annilese Miskimmon steers her cast successfully through the picturesque, action-packed narrative.Wendy Dawn Thompson finds a perfect match in the vulnerable, sexually ambiguous title role, her rich mezzo perfectly scaled to the music. Gillian Keith sparkles as the coloratura-flaunting actress Philine, and American tenor Ryan MacPherson makes a dashing Wilhelm, his two arias both winners. So is Indian tenor Amar Mucchala as Philine’s devoted admirer Frederick, while Lothario, Mignon’s crazed, fire-raising father, finds a credible interpreter in Russell Smythe.

Maria, Countess of Rohan is secretly married to the Duke of Chevreuse, who has killed Richelieu’s nephew in a duel. To save him she turns for help to her former lover, the Count of Chalais. She’s also rejected the unwelcome advances of young cavalier, Armando di Gondi. The stage is set for a complex web of adultery and intrigue that Stephen Medcalf’s production attempts to clarify, although more consistently focused acting is really required. Francis O’Connor’s set represents the inner workings of some vast clock, the passing of time and the approach of the fatal hour being constantly evoked in the narrative. But it lacks a visible entrance to the secret passage that forms another crucial element.The evening wins its spurs through high-quality singing. Mary Plazas’s intelligent commitment as Maria, Mirouslava Yordanova’s suave elegance as Armando, William Dazeley’s fierce bel canto anger as Chevreuse and John Bellemer’s indecisive tenor romantics as Chalais all impress.

These days, there’s a strong temptation to perform them as if they were real operas, but they throw up a number of problems. One is the static nature of much of the choral participation. In her Buxton production, director Olivia Fuchs adds in a lot of fussy choral hand movements, timed to coincide with the music and to express, presumably, communal feeling. Leaving aside the fact that timing is inexact and the meaning inscrutable, some of it looks downright silly. It’s a major own goal and an unfortunate recurring mannerism of Fuchs’ work that regularly sabotages the impact as a whole of her often perceptive direction.Here, she and her designer Yannis Thavoris transfer the Old Testament tale of King Saul and his young protege/rival David to post-war America, with Anne Marie Gibbons’s David a pilot returning victoriously from Hiroshima. At first he’s welcomed by Jonathan Best’s unstable President Saul, but gradually the older man’s paranoid jealousy of David’s youth and popularity kick in.Acting performances are all presentable, and vocally it’s a good if not a distinguished evening – a first-night announcement at the beginning of Act II gave notice that Best was singing through a cold, though he gives a decent account of himself. So do the others, as well as the orchestra under conductor Harry Christophers. But overall it’s a tepid show, only intermittently involving.

Is it an operetta of world-weary escapism, a deliberate satire on theatrical expectations or something more? Act III lacks a big clinching number, but the score can be affecting and Tom Hawkes certainly takes it seriously in a production whose virtues are determinedly old-fashioned. The performance space is transformed into something like a conventional stage, designer Peter Rice evoking Second Empire Paris with sensible economy, an all-purpose metal frame and well-chosen, often elegant props. While her companions are attired in Belle Epoque pastels, Kate Ladner’s mistress is resplendent in scarlet – you can tell it is going to be an old-fashioned evening. Creams and whites dominate the final act with the Mediterranean blue of Nice suggested by Colin Grenfell’s lighting. Peter Selwyn’s orchestra is on superb form, producing a subtle and blended sonority that has one forgetting first night rainfall so torrential that wildlife seeks refuge under the hi-tech canopy.The cast has no serious weaknesses, although the women generally outshine the men. Sean Ruane returns as Ruggero, fresh-faced and ardent even if the voice tightens at times, its full potential remaining obstinately untapped. As mouthy maid Lisette, Hye-Youn Lee is as dauntingly pert and precise as she was in OHP’s La boheme in 2009. (Much of the writing here sounds as if Puccini is trying to recapture Musetta’s waltz and failing). The smaller parts are uniformly well sung by a youthful team, several big names of the future doubtless lurking in the lower ranks.

In Act 3, though, he and his librettist introduce a mystical, high-flown scene in which Cendrillon and her Prince Charming are brought together by the Fairy in an enchanted forest. The result seems dramatically redundant and the overwrought musical dramatics fit awkwardly into Massenet’s lightweight scheme – a curious misjudgement that spoils the perfection of an otherwise highly attractive score.Designer Barbara de Limburg sets this among the chimneys of Cinderella’s home, though for much of the evening Pelly’s production and its overall look (Pelly also provides the costumes) maintains a traditional picture-book manner, spiced up with a sharply observed comic slant. Much of the result, notably Laura Scozzi’s highly choreographed movements for the dancers and chorus, is brilliantly managed.So too are the individual performances, especially Joyce DiDonato’s immaculately judged Cendrillon, matched by Alice Coote’s physically convincing Prince Charming.Eglise Gutierrez confirms her growing reputation as a coloratura specialist with her scintillating Fairy, while Polish contralto Ewa Podles sends up her own grand vocal manner with a resplendent reading of Cendrillon’s stepmother, Madame de la Haltiere. Jean-Philippe Lafont huffs and puffs effectively as her henpecked husband.It all makes for a clever, touching entertainment, especially with the Gallic deftness provided by conductor Bertrand de Billy.

He essentially invented the notion of the British Empire.It pays to make some effort to find out such biographical details before Damon Albarn strums one of his melancholic chords, because his new production, subtitled An English Opera, barely makes any effort to piece Dee’s remarkably full life together into a coherent narrative.Instead, we’re left with a succession of quite beautiful scenes, both visually and musically, which hardly hang together but still, somehow, work as a breathtaking spectacle. Huge credit must go to set designer Stephen Higgins for this. His screens of corrugated paper are a neat device which work as projections, organic set changes and nods to Dee’s love of books.And yet, perhaps too often, the eye wanders to Albarn, who somewhat off-puttingly peers down on proceedings from above, playing guitar, singing and mock-conducting.For all the drama on stage – and there is plenty of it – the decision to have the lead character almost mute is a mistake. From his body language alone, Bertie Cavell looks like he would be an intriguing Dee, but because we never really get the chance to know him, it’s impossible to lament his downfall.This is a shame really, because Albarn and Norris have created a piece which is rich in invention, imagery and imagination. The combination of the BBC Philharmonic and Albarn’s eclectic band works wonderfully. It just lacks a human heart – which could easily be rectified by the time it helps launch the London 2012 Festival next year.

Its delights are usually even more potent in summertime, especially in relaxed open-air settings such as Holland Park.The music is well-served in this new production, with a talented clutch of young singers in the five principal roles. There are ravishing accounts of Deh Vieni and Dove Sono by Jane Harrington (a late replacement) and Elizabeth Llewellyn respectively. Also vocally sumptuous, Hannah Pedley’s Cherubino stands out for an engaging characterisation lacking elsewhere in the main cast.Fresh from recent work with English Touring Opera, Holland Park newcomer Liam Steel’s setting taps into the Downton Abbey zeitgeist, a bustling army of Edwardian household staff making balletic contributions throughout. The constant sense of motion is often effective, but sometimes intrusive – and seems to be at the expense of humour. Figaro is not all about laughs, but they are integral to it. Lynton Black’s Bartolo provides welcome comedy touches, but the overriding atmosphere is too serious. Ironically, the Count’s heart-stopping final-scene utterance, “Countess forgive me”, does elicit a laugh – inappropriately.The City of London Sinfonia shines under conductor Matthew Willis, his sometimes over-cautious approach redeemed by a superbly-paced Act 4 finale. Catriona Beveridge is an excellently alert recitative accompanist. There’s a lot to enjoy in this production, not least the first-class singing. The lively choreography impresses (a huge bravo to the hard-working chorus), but an injection of fun is needed to make it more successful.

The latest attempt to repeat the magic formula, however, doesn’t quite work.Rinaldo was the first opera Handel wrote for London, its huge success putting him on the local map and eventually leading to his permanent residence in England. Back in 1711, it received a spectacular staging, presenting the struggle between the Christian invaders and the Moslem defenders at the First Crusade, with both sides using magic to aid their endeavours.Robert Carsen and designer Gideon Davey instead place the action in a modern if old-fashioned school where the boys – who look like members of the some medieval officer training corps in their silver breastplates – take on two individual teachers, who turn into the romantic figures of Brenda Rae’s sorceress Armida and Luca Pisaroni’s Saracen general Argante. Their troops are Armida’s prim school girls, originally wearing burkas, who later turn into St Trinian’s-like hooligans – only wearing fetish gear. Visual references to Harry Potter raise some laughs. Or is it all merely happening in the fevered imagination of Sonia Prina’s bullied Rinaldo, obsessed with his teacher and fantasising the rest?Who knows and – one is tempted to say – who cares? Carsen’s reductive facetiousness scarcely matches the heroics and grand passions of the original.Vocal standards are presentable. While conductor Ottavio Dantone draws enticing sounds from the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, there’s a lack of dynamism.

At first it looks relatively simple. But further investigation reveals how one of the two has been manipulated by multiple internet identities created by the other into committing a near-fatal crime on his person. That both are essentially children makes it all the more shocking.In Craig Lucas’ libretto as clearly set to music by Muhly and staged by Bartlett Sher, the story is well and swiftly told. Though the device of the female detective inspector with a few easily recognisable traits overseeing the investigation takes us towards the level of the US TV mini-series, Susan Bickley’s brisk, businesslike Anne Strawson is an effective if artificial creation, linking events both pre- and post-crime. Nicky Spence is extraordinarily credible as Brian, lured into a cyber-world he does not understand, and the apparently multiple individuals he gets mixed up with are brilliantly personified, with the final one, Joseph Beesley’s tragically vulnerable teenage boy, emerging as indelibly moving.Sets by Michael Yeargan, costumes by Catherine Zuber, video by Fifty Nine Productions, and Rumon Gamba’s conducting all contribute to an impressive launch. Only Muhly’s score, too much of it registering as a commonplace and ultimately thin soundtrack accompaniment, disappoints.

His is a predominantly fast reading that maintains the music’s emotional momentum while never short-changing its depth – there’s a lot more detail and finesse than usual.In the absence of Patricia Racette, the originally announced Butterfly, he’s exceptionally well served by soprano Kristine Opolais, who coincidentally recently became Mrs Nelsons. For some years when Nelsons was music director there, she was a leading member of the Latvian National Opera company in Riga, also making successful foreign forays. Her full-on interpretation is founded on a tireless instrument that remains fresh and exciting right up the devastating final bars.Helene Schneiderman returns as a movingly supportive Suzuki, Anthony Michaels-Moore as a generously voiced Consul. James Valenti looks convincing as Pinkerton, though the thinning out of his tone towards the top of his un-Italianate voice is not what is required.As usual at Covent Garden, the smaller roles are perfectly integrated into the bigger picture. Among them, ZhengZhong Zhou offers a lyrically touching, dignified Prince Yamadori and Jeremy White’s Bonze is simply terrifying. In what are his final appearances on the stage, Robin Leggate is once again the immaculately realised Goro – one of the secondary parts he has turned into a series of true standouts over a career at Covent Garden that began back in 1977 and now totals more than 900 performances.

It’s a reminder that both the major London companies now possess productions of the piece that owe more to German expressionism than the naturalist tradition. Yet they are both fascinating realisations, Decker’s arguably even finer than David Alden’s for ENO in its detail and dramatic power – the artificial, mob-like movements of the chorus, originally choreographed by Athol Farmer and here revived by Ruth Moss, are brilliantly achieved.Ben Heppner is also back in the title role. He has occasional difficulties with his voice high up and under pressure that marginally detract from his heroic rather than lyrical approach to the role. The problem is that Decker presents the villagers as so grotesque that all sympathy shifts to Heppner’s cuddly, misunderstood Grimes.While all the secondary roles – Roderick Williams’s canny Ned Keene, Jane Henschel’s manic, slightly OTT Mrs Sedley, Alan Oke’s strident Bob Boles, Matthew Best’s dry Swallow, Catherine Wyn-Rogers’s maternal Auntie – are memorably drawn, it’s in the excellence of the two other principal roles that much of the evening’s success lies. Amanda Roocroft’s pained lyricism combines with a flawless physical realisation to make schoolmistress Ellen Orford utterly real in her generosity and disappointment. Jonathan Summers is a vocal tower of strength as Balstrode, keeping a wary eye on the village rather than judging. They’re both about as good as it gets.In another welcome return, conductor Andrew Davis delivers the piece with consistent insight and dynamism, with both orchestra and chorus responding keenly to him.

In the plot, Mamud, Sultan of Cambaia (now in India), has married Rustena while continuing his relationship with his courtesan Damira. To give the latter more security, he promises to switch her son Melindo with Rustena’s son Zelim.Twenty years later, when Melindo is on the point of marrying Rosena, he decides to reveal the truth.Things are never as simple as that, however, though the set-up does keep all six characters busy over the course of the evening singing a wide range of arias and the odd ensemble expressing their reactions to the fix they’re in.The arias themselves are often surprisingly inventive, full of unexpected harmonic or melodic twists and turns. As psychological portraits, they’re often acute; as music they’re delightful.A strong cast makes the best of them in David Freeman’s quietly authoritative production, set in Duncan Hayler’s designs in a vast greenhouse whose central frozen tree spouts flame as the emotional thaw of the end turns the heat up.Laurence Cummings conducts a spry account of the score, with a standout performance from Ida Falk Winland as Rosena.

Though it sticks more closely to the imagery of the fairy-tale tradition of the piece than did David Pountney’s famous 1986 ENO version, designed by the late Stefanos Lazaridis, it too explores it in depth and works its own very special – and often dark – magic.From the movements of the dancing nymphs to the ghastly vision of the bloodied Rusalka stumbling around after the witch Jezibaba has cut off her tail to fulfil her desire to become human, the result is a finely realised and unforgettably potent piece of theatre.Musically, the score is in the safe hands of conductor Stephen Barlow, whose appreciable skills in the romantic repertoire in particular are at last becoming widely appreciated. The expanded English Chamber Orchestra plays marvellously for him.On the first night not everything went well vocally. Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts, an engaged and powerful Prince, was having some difficulty in producing clean, clear tone. Anne-Sophie Duprels, a compelling Rusalka, sounded occasionally cloudy, and at other times buoyant. Emma Carrington’s witch had some hoarse moments to offset her clipped, businesslike delivery of a comic-grotesque role. Even Clive Bayley sounded worn – perhaps not surprisingly given that he’s also making his mark in the festival’s Tristan production.But in terms of drama, all the performances register impressively, including Janis Kelly’s Joan Collins-like Foreign Princess. With a bit of luck, this was just an off-night. In any case, it remains a spellbinding show.

At its best, the cast takes collective flight in what would seem a rare alignment of individual comic talent and sharp directing. A case in point is the Act 1 sequence in which Fiorilla’s deliciously flirtatious encounter with the visiting Turkish prince, Selim, leads to a spitting row between Fiorilla and her hapless husband Don Geronio – he trying in vain to assert his authority, she feisty and defiant.As Selim, Dutch baritone Quirijn de Lang moves with the grace and charisma of a movie star. Mark Stone’s dependably rich baritone suits the Poet, and Geoffrey Dolton plays the browbeaten, inadequate Geronio engagingly, without over-blustering. David Alegret’s Don Narciso sings with agility, if the tone is slightly strained.But in an accomplished cast, Rebecca Nelsen’s flighty Fiorilla stands out. Confidently alluring and comically intuitive, she is also vocally ravishing, matching athleticism with effortless tonal shading. She is surely a star on the rise.

On this showing Martina Serafin’s instrument and physiognomy may be less sheerly beautiful than the Romanian soprano’s, but she has considerable vocal heft and the potential to give us a more detailed portrayal than she actually delivers. Revival director Duncan Macfarland sometimes lets her stand and sing in the unbecoming frocks but at least she eschews anything cute or coquettish.Marcello Giordani, an old sparring partner of hers, turns in a generalised, old-fashioned Cavaradossi. While the high notes are there, loud, ringing and idiomatic in a way that Kaufman’s arguably are not, the bottom of the voice is less reliable and the acting is hammy.Juha Uusitalo’s Baron Scarpia is reliable and conveys a certain villainous sleaze, a mite underpowered vocally and conceptually after Bryn Terfel’s not conspicuously aristocratic portrayal. This is the Finnish bass-baritone’s first appearance in the house and he is well supported by the lively playing of Hubert Francis as his sidekick Spoletta.The staging itself remains a crowd-pleaser – Paul Brown’s split-level chapel setting for Act 1 seems less cluttered from the cheaper seats. Act 3 is different in style, the castle a stubby, residual suggestion of a fort, the sky dominated by the impression of a gigantic wing of uncertain symbolic import. For good or ill we have moved on from extravagant literalism, and Mark Henderson’s lighting is evocative, the orchestral playing more so – bronchial intrusions notwithstanding. But then it is difficult to imagine a more sensitively characterised tapestry of sound than that which Antonio Pappano engenders throughout.

In his day Mascagni – still famous for Cavalleria Rusticana – was regarded by some as Puccini’s equal, if not his superior. Composed immediately following the worldwide success of Cavalleria, Friend Fritz (1891) is a much lighter piece. Set in a Jewish community in 19th-century Alsace, it is a comedy about a middle-aged man who is reluctant to marry but is eventually persuaded by a persistent young woman and some fairly pushy friends, notably the local rabbi.Though Annilese Miskimmon’s sparky production, attractively relocated to the 1960s in Nicky Shaw’s designs, leaves the question open, there’s a possible gay subtext here – why is the likeable Fritz so uninterested in marriage, and so upset when he finally makes up his mind to wed Suzel? His friends Hanezo and Federico seem to regard his conversion to the idea as a betrayal.At any rate it’s an interesting and charming show with an often delightful score to match. Here Eric Margiore presents a dapper, personable Fritz, though his top notes fail to blossom. As Suzel, soprano Anna Leese has a slight edge to the tone but plenty of warmth, both vocal and personal. David Stephenson’s cast-iron baritone finds good employment as the rabbi who won’t take no for an answer. And mezzo Patricia Orr delivers the violin-playing gypsy boy Beppe with alacrity. Best of all is conductor Stuart Stratford, who fires up the score’s genuine passion and conveys its subtle delicacy.

Returning to the show is conductor Enrique Mazzola, who maintains lively momentum from the pit.The cast is new and much of it special, though Paolo Gavanelli makes a rather muted Dr Dulcamara, proving not entirely versed in the traditional buffo skills that can make the role a star part. But he is acceptable.More rewarding is the Sergeant Belcore of Russian baritone Rodion Pogossov, who brings the cocksure ladykiller to  life in a performance of flamboyant macho panache.Debuting with the company is the American Stephen Costello as the lovelorn Nemorino. Tall, good-looking and youthful, he charms in the role, acting with considerable skill and wit, his focused tenor making a graceful highlight out of his famous showpiece aria, Una Furtiva Lagrima.But undoubtedly the star of the show is soprano Danielle de Niese, who made her international reputation with her glamorous Cleopatra at Glyndebourne in 2005. Her voice has become more substantial, and she sings Donizetti’s music with immaculate style. With her perfectly articulated bel canto vocalism blending into her overall acting performance, this interpretation represents a further step in the development of a remarkable artist, who lights up the stage with every gesture. She enjoys a well deserved triumph.

And so it is with his new Simon Boccanegra for English National Opera.The medieval Genoese setting of the prologue shifts to the sixties, with Act 1 beginning in the present, rather than the stipulated 25 years later. The father-daughter relationship of Boccanegra and Amelia becomes ambiguous – Amelia now only imagining herself as his long-lost daughter.Many of Tcherniakov’s ideas are refreshing. The moment when Boccanegra is announced leader in Act 1’s Fiesco Square, with its Hopper-esque glowing bar, is ingeniously frozen and quickly transformed into a framed memento within the ultra-minimalist Grimaldi home.But the frequent teleprompter-style projection of the synopsis is a killer of dramatic anticipation. And the council chamber – a grey, already lifeless conference room – is filled with a mostly static chorus, creating a bland sea of grey (the only kind of sea, in fact, despite the opera’s maritime theme).But, even in corporate suit and tie, Bruno Caproni’s  Boccanegra gives a sense of grandeur and clemency, though, clad in bikers’ leathers, Peter Auty is occasionally also taxed vocally as Gabriele. Brindley Sherratt is a thrilling Fiesco, and Rena Harms does her best to beat through the drainpipe jeans and long, woolly black top.For all the apparent fund of ideas, though, the drama appears repressed. The lifeblood of the production is music director Edward Gardner in the pit, coaxing and pacing the dramatic intensity, and bonding effortlessly and organically with his singers.

Donald Maxwell delivers an expert account of the old buffer who makes a foolish marriage and lives to regret it. Aiding and abetting him is Richard Burkhard, as a silky-smooth Malatesta. Their famous patter duet, is a song and dance routine that would fit neatly into a West End musical.Colin Lee sings the role of Don Pasquale’s disobedient nephew Ernesto, with boundless grace and charm, his agile tenor floating easily up to the high notes. Majella Cullagh sings Norina, Ernesto’s girlfriend and Pasquale’s phoney bride. A natural stage performer, she runs rings around Donizetti’s tricky vocal lines, and even puts in a few additional decorations of her own – her musicality is second to none.Director Stephen Barlow and designer Colin Richmond take full advantage of the unusually shaped Holland Park stage. Their production takes place in a British seaside resort, where the Italian, Pasquale, owns a rundown fish and chip shop. Come the second act and his fake bride’s expenditure, it is transformed into Corneto’s, an ultra-smart eatery. Barlow’s comic sense is acute and never stupid, though he’s apt to upstage his own central action with occasional, if admittedly funny diversions by extras.But this is a tricky comedy to handle, especially the notorious moment when Norina slaps the old boy. Here there’s violence early – a mistake. And the final joke – Pasquale has a heart attack – should have been dropped during rehearsals.

Here, Tristan (Richard Berkeley-Steele) and Isolde (Alwyn Mellor) declare their devotion to the night, a force which, like the love between them, is all-consuming.The huge cut-outs of the goblet, Morold’s skull and a dagger may have caused unintentional amusement, but other bold ideas work well – the minimalist, white-walled ferry in which Tristan transports Isolde to Cornwall, the combat khakis of King Mark’s hunting party and, more unusually, the ghostly appearances in Act III of little Tristan and his now-deceased parents.Mellor’s violence and frenzy can be compelling but her voice soon becomes forced in the higher reaches, and Berkeley-Steele, by turns stoical and fevered, begins to sound tired by Act III.The most impressive vocal performance comes from bass Clive Bayley’s King Mark – transcending his cloth-cap and jeans with a magisterially cavernous tone and cleanly sculpted delivery of the text, as well as touchingly conveying the tragedy of his battle to comprehend Tristan’s mysteriously uncharacteristic betrayal of him.If Stephen Barlow’s direction in the pit isn’t ceaselessly involving, once one is acclimatised to the orchestra’s scale, the English Chamber Orchestra delivers some richly intense playing. A more persuasive central couple is needed, though, to lift this into a truly arousing production.

Set in a corner of the deer park, the new 600-seater pop-up theatre (to be dismantled at the end of each month-long season) boasts a steel and timber construction whose pit is set against a snaking ha-ha wall. The stage is deep, the acoustic revealing and the aspect light and open.Olivia Fuchs’ Magic Flute is equally bold in concept, brilliantly conceived in visual terms. The Queen of the Night’s three Ladies are sharp-bobbed, leather-skirted temptresses, at one point emerging within huge suspended, black fabric slings. The bird-catcher Papageno is a tattooed, beer-loving, bare-chested, kilted boy about town – he and Pamina duet about the cosiness of marriage in a shared bathtub. The Speaker is a tweed-jacketed librarian whose mustard corduroys take their place within the myriad yellows and oranges of Sarastro’s diversely costumed modern day hippy followers. And, perhaps most enticing of all, Tamino and Pamina’s trials bring traversals through real flames and real water.All this would count for little were the singers not well cast in almost every case. If William Berger’s laddish Papageno steals the show, Robert Murray’s Tamino stands up well. Sophie Bevan sparkles as Pamina and Kim Sheehan musters a powerful Queen of the Night in her stratospheric arias.The Garsington Opera Orchestra performs solidly under Martin Andre, who just occasionally errs on the sober side, and allows his singers too much latitude to breathe.The production may dwell more on the comic Singspiel element than on masonic ritual, but it is uninhibited and often magical nonetheless.

Angela Davies’ sets reference the 1997 film noir tribute LA Confidential, moving the piece to a situation where the head of the violent, corrupt LAPD is challenged by a lowlife journalist working for a publication called The Jester. In its sassy, knowing way, the transfer proves as effective as Jonathan Miller’s iconic 1982 ENO staging.Slater can rely on a dramatically committed cast, all of whom make a strong showing. Bar possessing a real trill, Laura Mitchell sings the role of Rigoletto’s daughter Gilda with impeccable command. Marco Panuccio’s Duke is the work of an artist. Though his basic tone doesn’t always register positively, the police head’s easy morals and ladykiller manner are perfectly realised.Dominating the opera is Damiano Salerno’s Rigoletto – the most challenging baritone role in the entire Italian repertoire, which he makes sound easy. Again, his focused characterization of the conflicted character grips the audience throughout.Timothy Dawkins’ Sparafucile possesses a baleful, ink-black bass, brilliantly matched by an initial appearance that leaves him scarily invisible as he lurks in the shadows. As his seductive sister Maddalena, Carolyn Dobbin offers porn-star looks in Davies’ costume and a mezzo full of sexual promise. For once Monterone makes a genuinely potent impression, Andrew Greenan’s sepulchral tone as dignified as his Orthodox Jewish appearance.The chorus has a couple of untidy moments, despite the clear beat of conductor Toby Purser, whose keen understanding of Verdi’s score is demonstrated in every single bar.

So it’s a real pity that this new staging of Mozart’s classic comedy by Welsh National Opera staff director Benjamin Davis, and designed by Max Jones, who has previously created work by the company’s educational wing, WNO MAX, should be such a dud.The staging moves the setting of the piece to a British seaside resort in the sixties, though for some reason all six of the main characters are described as either Italian immigrants or visitors (so why move them in the first place?). It doesn’t make much sense of the relationships, and turning maid Despina into a single mother, though it’s some sort of idea, is not a very good one.However, it’s the level of the humour aimed at that’s most worrying. Seaside postcard vulgarity is not what Mozart and Da Ponte were aiming at in what is one of the most sophisticated comedies every written. Very few of the gags spring out of the plot or the characters. The lavatory brush routine might pass in a Carry On film, but not here.All the vocal performances reach an acceptable standard, and at this performance Joanne Boag stepped confidently in to replace Claire Ormshaw’s Despina. Neal Davies is a notable Alfonso, despite the surrounding tomfoolery. Conductor Daniele Rustioni maintains musical order – though it’s hardly a memorable evening, except for the wrong reasons.

There’s a danger, of course, that such shows inhabit a generic world instead – but Mexican company Teatro de Ciertos Habitantes have fashioned something that can speak to artists everywhere.Their show El Gallo is about the struggle to put on a difficult new opera. But if it speaks to artists everywhere, does it also speak to audiences everywhere? On that score (and of its musical score), I am more doubtful. There’s a tendency with this kind of naval-gazing theatre for an audience to simply shrug and say, ‘Who cares? No one asked you to do it.’But if, like me, you thrill to shows such as Philip Glass’ Sanskrit opera Satyagraha and wonder how on earth a company like English National Opera ever wrestled with its demands, this show offers a glimpse of what it might have been like backstage. And as this company of six singers fights British composer Paul Barker’s insistent, occasionally beautiful score to the ground – and at some points is taken down with it, in every sense – I was drawn into its occasionally baffling but atmospheric world.With a live, eight-piece string orchestra joining the singers on a bare stage, there’s a long delay as an elevated performance platform is clumsily put into place for the climax of the piece, destroying the improvisational atmosphere that preceded it.

Lloyd’s big idea is about children – the Macbeths are childless, though fantasise about having them – as if this in itself explained their steady descent into nationwide violence. Worse are the ugliness of Anthony Ward’s costumes and the grotesque (in the wrong way) presentation of the witches, who are onstage far too often. The intervention of Banquo’s ghost is singularly ineffective.Yet musically this revival goes with a bang under the idiomatic baton of Antonio Pappano, and the singing ranges from the good to the excellent. We get an unusual edition of the score, which presents both the endings Verdi wrote – the original solo scene of 1847 followed by the revised choral version of 1865 – though Simon Keenlyside’s scrupulously sung Macbeth justifies this odd procedure. He may not persuade that he has an ideal coloristic range for the part, but his musicianship is extraordinary and his vocal acting intelligent.Russian soprano Liudmyla Monastyrska astonishes with the accomplishment of her singing, nailing just about every single note in the difficult score. She’s a more limited actress, however. Raymond Aceto’s Banquo and Dimitri Pittas’ Macduff are both on the loud and unsubtle side. Yet all in all, enough of the score hits home to make this a worthwhile evening, despite the visuals.

Faced in pseudo-Renaissance stonework, Paul Brown’s massive Rubik’s cube set is constantly on the move, opening this way and that to symbolize a society in various states of moral decay.That would seem the intention but, like everything else in an evening in which Mark Henderson’s lighting is striking but too dim to allow expression to register on the faces of the protagonists, we cannot be sure.Costumes are Fellini-inspired yet that director’s loose, hedonistic style is rigorously eschewed – the singers are often made to stand and sing in isolated social bubbles. There is a more vibrant party scene and the palazzo is impressively torched by an avenging mob at the end of Act 1, anticipating (or, as it turns out, compensating for the lack of) the hellfire of Act 2.Architectural detail impresses but the overwhelming impression is grey, even as the Commendatore returns as a blood-stained zombie rather than the statue promised in the synopsis.The finely-sung Leporello of Matthew Rose is allowed some humour, his catalogue aria supplemented by a slew of Polaroid snapshots, a motif neatly reprised at the close. Lucas Meachem’s benign Don seems to have wandered in from another production, his shimmering, high baritone ill-suited to conveying the charmless menace that, rightly or wrongly, Kent’s conception demands.Another Glyndebourne debutant, practised Queen of the Night Albina Shagimuratova, wins over the audience with her vocal warmth as Donna Anna. There is some spirited playing in the pit, several numbers being launched at a tempo marginally faster than the singers can cope with. Fortepiano colours the recitatives.

This production of Wagner’s epic comedy is a major achievement, if an imperfect one.Working with designer Vicki Mortimer, David McVicar moves the period forward from the mid-16th century to around 1820. The first act, set in a church, is wonderfully presented, though some of its fixed elements work less well later on – neither the second-act riot nor the final scene of communal merrymaking has enough space. Replacing the traditional procession of the guilds, groups of dancers and other entertainers bring the civic celebrations perilously close to kitsch.The first act’s finely detailed performances are not consistently followed through. Brilliantly realised though Johannes Martin Kranzle’s Beckmesser often is, the added pratfalls seem a betrayal of the production’s higher aspirations. The rewritten end of the opera is thoughtful, if not entirely convincing.Vocally, some performances prove fallible. Marco Jentzsch’s Walther keeps faith with the notes but his tone rarely shines. Topi Lehtipuu struggles with David’s high-lying part. Anna Gabler’s Eva is on the cool side.At the centre of the piece, Gerald Finley’s Hans Sachs holds firm throughout the long evening, though the character’s humanity and warmth are not yet fully on show. Alastair Miles’ Pogner is vocally impressive though dramatically bland.In the pit, conductor Vladimir Jurowski secures a solid performance that takes intermittent flight and will surely gain in clarity and spaciousness as the run proceeds

Sue Willmington’s costumes suggest the sixties.“On the eve of his wedding”, a revised synopsis begins, “a man returns to his old school. Long-forgotten memories of his school days come back to him in the form of a dream…” This turns out to be Paul Whelan’s Theseus, who spends the entire show watching what is presumably his own past as a child abuse victim play back. It’s heady stuff, although Alden’s thorough-going approach means that the spirit of much of the opera is stifled in exploring it, including such crucial elements as the comedy and the magic.Led by Willard White’s grand-scale Bottom, the mechanicals’ play within a play goes riotously, although it seems little more than an add-on to Alden’s central idea, as do – also problematically – the lovers. The vast fairy troupe (some 40 strong) makes its mark, their members mainly drawn from Trinity Boys’ Choir. The If-like rebellion launched when the cigarettes are passed around and the school set on fire is brilliantly staged, though Alden’s stagecraft is assured throughout. Vocally and musically this is a remarkable evening, surviving even the loss of Iestyn Davies’ Oberon, who mimes the part while William Towers sings it magically. There’s some beautifully detailed conducting from Leo Hussain, but also a slight lack of momentum.

John Fulljames returns to Leeds for his second Janacek production following the success of The Adventures of Mr Broucek in 2009. Based on Dostoyevsky’s semi-autobiographical novella about his experiences in a Siberian prison camp, House of the Dead is strong stuff, and might sound depressing were it not for the humanity and warmth the composer brings to his task of revealing ‘the spark of God’ in every human being – even the brutal murderers who form the central characters. Episodic in structure, the opera centres on Goryanchikov, the Dostoyevsky figure, humiliated and flogged on his arrival by Stephen Richardson’s sadistic Governor. During the course of the piece, a series of monologues exposes the guilty torment of individual prisoners.The ensemble nature of the piece is wonderfully realised by an exemplary cast and the outstanding male chorus under Fulljames’s taut direction, while Dick Bird’s designs and Bruno Poet’s lighting provide atmospheric realism interspersed with symbolism.Among the standouts are Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts’s nervy Filka Morozov, Alan Oke’s resonant Skuratov and Robert Hayward’s solid Shishkov, each with his harrowing tale to tell. Claire Wild is deeply moving as the young boy Alyeya, who finds in Goryanchikov a father figure. The central role itself was finely presented at this performance by Richard Morrison, standing in for an indisposed Roderick Williams.Opera North’s orchestra attacks Janacek’s punchy writing with serious commitment, producing a wonderfully rich sound – conductor Richard Farnes, like the late, great Sir Charles Mackerras, reveals the lyricism at its heart.

Are these ‘Triplets’ really archangels carrying out God’s work, or fundamentalists bent on destroying their enemies? The trio’s furtive glances and their ritualistic changing from manual workers’ clothes into suits (concealing gun holsters) before leaving for their ‘mission’ suggests one thing – the atrocities they claim to want to halt in the neighbouring towns suggest another.The trio’s fervent, penetrating intensity is matched by the string players of the Britten Sinfonia – a highly motivated army of generals under the lucid direction of Clark Rundell.Amid all the searing drama it’s easy to overlook the figures of Abraham and Sarah. Director Katie Mitchell (who also worked on MacMillan’s recent The Sacrifice for Welsh National Opera) succeeds in beautifully and delicately conveying their mutual respect, while Grant Doyle sings Abraham with a pure, uncomplicated richness one could happily listen to all night and Janis Kelly perceptively reflects the burden of Sarah’s longstanding sterility seemingly as much by what is thought as what is sung. Equally powerful in narrative and in musical terms, this work seems to have hit the ground running.

A new synopsis is provided in the programme, which is useful given that the action is radically different from anything Berlioz might have imagined.Designed by Hildegard Bechtler and Katrina Lindsay, Gilliam’s version attempts to follow “the trajectory of German art and history from the late 19th century to the mid-20th century”. So we get the First World War (the crowned heads of Europe tear a giant cake apart to the strains of Berlioz’s Hungarian March) and then the Nazis. One might have thought that there was enough material in the original by Goethe – a theme that has fascinated artists in many genres for centuries – without the glib substitution Gilliam performs.Given his genuinely extraordinary visual talent, however, several scenes are brilliantly staged – including the grotesquely shocking Minuet of the Will o’ the Wisps, used as a background for a highly-choreographed Kristallnacht, or the Ride to the Abyss, with Peter Hoare’s Faust and Christopher Purves’ Mephistopheles racing through a nightmarish forest on a motorbike and sidecar.Quite a lot of the rest looks inept or even amateurish. And the basic concept seems an application of highly-charged imagery to lend a specious sense of seriousness to something far flimsier.Wonderful singing from Christine Rice’s Marguerite, though Hoare’s character tenor sounds thin and Purves’ Mephisto lightweight. And Nicholas Folwell makes a dull thing of Brander’s Song of the Rat. Conductor Edward Gardner secures a performance that is diligent while short on fire and brimstone.

And the roaring applause was, mostly, richly deserved. Villazon may perhaps not be back at full vocal power, following the removal of a cyst from his vocal cords two years ago, but there’s plenty of expressive shading. This doesn’t always go for the acting, which – though he can tense and relax his entire body at the drop of a hat – sometimes turns towards the hammy.French mezzo-soprano Sophie Koch displays impressive vocal richness and openness as Charlotte, the object of Werther’s passion, all the while torn between her love for Werther and the promise to her dying mother to marry Albert. The latter comes across as an unnecessarily bland figure in Audun Iversen’s portrayal, though it is well sung.Though there’s a strong supporting cast, Charles Edwards’s set designs define the production – from the running fountain set among effusive creepers within the Bailli’s garden wall in Act I, to Act III’s expansive colour-sapped room in which Charlotte stands in stark isolation. Werther’s own loneliness is underlined in Act IV, his garret initially lost at the rear of the stage before drawing towards the front amid glinting snowflakes.It almost goes without saying that conductor Antonio Pappano gives his best to this lyrical Romantic score, lavishing upon it – perhaps unlike Werther upon Charlotte – love as well as passion.

Accurate gait from the chorus members of Edinburgh Studio Opera – carrying signifying horns, ears or tails according to the animal – provides a delightful visual starting point.It’s simple stuff, reflecting the simplicity of the rest of this project. Alexander McCall Smith’s central idea is that the matrilineal baboons of the Okavango Delta in Botswana exhibit Lady Macbeth’s murderously ambitious traits. After a spot of local creation myth, a trio of primatologists observe a troop of baboons, discovering with glee that evil exists even here.Among the baboons, the main soloists acquit themselves reasonably well. Beth Mackay’s slight frame belies a gorgeous voice for the obviously ambitious Lady Macbeth, with Lucinda Stuart-Grant clear of voice as her friend. Ronan Busfield’s Macbeth is clearly not up to the job of king, driven to murder Andrew McTaggart’s easy and powerful alpha male, Duncan, and pin it on a passing leopard.Not that they have a lot to work with in Tom Cunningham’s score. Redolent of English church music, with a couple of Lloyd Webber-ish soaring melodies and the odd calypso rhythm stirred into the easy mix, this is not going to challenge. Nor, however, does it give much to stir the cockles, even with Mr McFall’s Chamber providing the band.McCall Smith’s libretto has lovely moments, but the big concept is too slight. As one primatologist observes: “There are no tragedies in nature, only events, things that happen.”

Using images from Caspar David Friedrich as backgrounds centres the visuals in Beethoven’s own day, though the costumes and interiors are from modern times – the opera’s message of oppression defeated by personal heroism can work at almost any period. Yet there is a specificity to Albery’s direction, worked through with finely managed physicality by the entire cast and chorus, which reveals the truth of the characters and situations in an unusually involving way.Strong singing, too, virtually throughout, though at this performance tenor Steven Harrison struggled with Florestan’s aria. Emma Bell negotiates the sheer awkwardness of Beethoven’s writing with aplomb as part of an entirely convincing overall interpretation. Andrew Foster-Williams’s Pizarro has a tensile strength of purpose that makes his villainy frighteningly real. How nice to see the versatile Jeremy White deployed in the major role of Rocco, and revealing its depth and potential. Fflur Wyn and Joshua Ellicott shine as the optimistic Marzelline and over-persistent Jaquino respectively. A special word for the horns, who have a great night in some very exposed passages, and Opera North’s chorus, which makes a thrilling sound.

Rimsky-Korsakov’s historical tragedy (1899) is a staple in Russia, virtually unknown everywhere else – it receives its belated but well deserved Covent Garden premiere. Also arriving on the UK’s leading operatic stage for the first time is British director Paul Curran – highly admired internationally.It’s a fortuitous combination, because Curran and designer Kevin Knight bring contemporary Russia alive before our eyes, seeing parallels between the repressive mayhem of the reign of Tsar Ivan the Terrible and the blend of vulgarity and violence associated with the modern Russian mafia. The beautiful but innocent Marfa Sobakina, already an object of malign love and jealous hatred, is selected to be the Tsar’s unwilling bride, a combination of circumstances that will destroy her. Dramatically, the evening rises steadily up to Marfa’s searing final mad scene, Curran charting its slow burn with unerring skill.A strong cast makes the most of their opportunities. Marina Poplavskaya’s sensitivity is to the fore in her recreation of the vulnerable Marfa. Danish baritone Johan Reuter is utterly focused as her ruthless admirer Gryaznoy, Ukrainian tenor Dmytro Popov lyrical as her gentle betrothed Likov and Ekaterina Gubanova thrilling as her unforgiving rival Lyubasha, while Paata Burchuladze retains presence and compassion as her father Sobakin. But it’s remarkable company achievement, held together by Mark Elder’s persuasive baton, all adding up to a gripping evening.

A dark piece, in which an unnamed protagonist is consumed by the guilt of having murdered an old man whose beating heart he believes he can hear under the floorboards, turns jauntier here notwithstanding the expressionistic stage movement favoured by director Jonathan Moore. Giving the characters cheesy names (“Edgar” and “Alan”), Copeland enlists the loftier presence of Richard Strivens to incarnate “Shadow Edgar”, the narrator’s unintegrated dark side. The music bumps along for 35 minutes, its propulsive rhythms crying out for tighter articulation than Robert Ziegler obtains from Chroma Chamber Ensemble on opening night. The frequent shadowing of Richard Suart’s Rex Harrison-style declamation with a halo of pitched voices may work in time but creates synchronisation problems.The Doctor’s Tale is a lighter, longer entertainment devised by Anne Dudley, the gifted pop arranger and purveyor of incidental music, with Terry Jones of Monty Python, who also directs. Their central character, a much-loved doctor (“I know he’s a bit gruff/ But he really knows his stuff”) is threatened with the sack and later with death because he is in fact a dog. Drawn from a forthcoming children’s book, the concept skewers racism deftly enough yet the show seems oddly risk-averse. While ideas recur, vocal ensembles function and almost all the text is audible, the idiom resembles Sondheim minus the melody – amiable, charming, bland. Both performances are enhanced by the video designs of Finn Ross.

The present revival has not been problem free, but late replacement Mark Elder is at least familiar with the score. On stage the perspectives intended by set designer Robert Israel again seem oddly foreshortened. We are trapped in a drab and literal mid-20th-century detention block with guns in plentiful supply, not that there is always sufficient motivation for their presence.The cast is mostly new. Only the Florestan, Endrik Wottrich, is a returnee, recalled to his unlit vault alongside the battered suitcases of the disappeared (invisible from the cheaper seats). Though he sings well and looks right, there is something nasal in his timbre which does not qualify as heroic. Willard White’s brief cameo as a veteran Don Fernando brings the requisite dignity notwithstanding co-ordination problems with the pit. Kurt Rydl’s Rocco sounds generous, the wide vibrato not inappropriate when the character is getting on in years. Elizabeth Watts sparkles superbly as his daughter Marzelline. Ironing obsessively, she is unfazed by a production that at one point has her admirer Jaquino (Steven Ebel) poised to shoot his prospective father-in-law.Singing her first staged Leonore, Nina Stemme is less lankily convincing as Fidelio, less obviously the star of the show than predecessor Karita Mattila. To her credit, and/or that of revival director Daniel Dooner, she seems more plausibly part of this eccentric community. In the final tableau, set outdoors as it should be against a darkly evocative sky, she rides over first-rate choral forces with perfect intonation. Best ignore the curious shenanigans upstage involving John Wegner’s weaselly Pizarro and some equine statuary.

But this neglected piece is not forbidding – in embellished form, it tells a story from the composer’s own life, when his wife Pauline opened a letter, addressed to him by mistake, that led her to believe he was having an affair. All hell broke lose, with the lawyers called in. Only Strauss’ return home calmed Pauline down.In the opera she becomes Christine, with Richard Strauss renamed Robert Storch. But the scenario is the same, with the addition of an amusing young man – Baron Lummer – to whom Christine takes a shine during her husband’s absence, but who turns out to be on the make.Designed by Manfred Kaderk with some references to Gustav Klimt, Wolfgang Quetes’ production is a clever, witty affair, nicely matching Strauss’ busy, lavish score, which is marvellously played here under the company’s music director, Francesco Corti.The cast do a fine job, with German soprano Anita Bader furiously flamboyant yet genuinely touching as Christine – a star part carried off with aplomb. Roland Wood sings the more feet-on-the-ground composer with enriched tone and solid presence. Nicky Spence is the debonair but dishonest Baron, disguising his low intentions under some brilliant high notes, and Sarah Redgwick makes a great deal out of the Storchs’ knowing maid, Anna. All the small parts go well, though it’s a pity that this wordy, fast-moving comedy is sung in German rather than in the immediacy of an English translation.

This year’s choice is Monteverdi’s post-Trojan War tale of Penelope’s long wait for her absent husband, Ulysses.As usual with ENO these days, a director who’s a virtual opera novice makes his company debut. Unlike many recent occasions, the result is neither a disaster nor a qualified failure, but a significant success.Australian Benedict Andrews produces an intense and observant realisation of an ancient story, brought up to date in Alice Babidge’s contemporary costumes. Set designer Borkur Jonsson presents the Ithacan palace as an upscale modern interior laid bare within a perspex box. Night vision scenes of war play constantly on the television. Cameras record intimate secondary events in close-up, including detailed facial expressions, on screens placed above the stage. The entire cast enters into the spirit and the letter of Andrews’ sometimes disturbing vision with serious purpose and accomplishment. Given their combined vocal and dramatic quality, the result is one of ENO’s finest evenings in a long while.Particularly special are Pamela Helen Stephen’s Penelope, worn out by endless waiting and her importunate suitors, who are unusually unpleasant and invasive in this staging. Tom Randle’s Ulysses is a masterpiece of intelligent acting and focused singing. Ruby Hughes shines as the goddess Minerva, who enigmatically replicates Penelope physically. There are wonderful performances from Diana Montague as Penelope’s old nurse and Nigel Robson as the shepherd Eumete, while Jonathan Cohen and ENO’s instrumental ensemble accompany distinctively.

The work is performed in a mixture of German for the sung numbers and French for the spoken dialogue, which is largely new. Just seven singers take part in each of two casts, plus a couple of actors. Anything larger than a duet disappears, alongside the Three Ladies and Three Boys and the accompaniment is for piano – sensitively played here by Franck Krawczyk.What remains offers the essence of the narrative, yet somehow its unique balance has got out of kilter. While Mozart’s blend of spiritual mystery play and pantomime finds plenty of room for comedy, there is little here. Virgile Frannais’s Papageno is likeable but underplayed. Though neatly sung, neither Agnieszka Slawinska’s Pamina nor Leila Benhamza’s Queen of the Night offers special dramatic impact.Yet the simple designs – a forest of bamboo poles, doubling as Sarastro’s mystical realm – are subtly lit by Philippe Vialatte and there are moments of magical intimacy and wit. The Papageno/Papagena scene, with Betsabee Haas partnering Frannais, is a genuine highlight (she gets an additional number, too). Other episodes lack focus. If the small-scale nature of the vocalism is deliberately low-key, too much of the acting matches it – Patrick Bolleire’s Sarastro needs more weight to carry the charge of his spiritual mission. Ironically, given Brook’s intention of coming closer to Mozart, it feels more distant than more conventional stagings.

Always a committed artist, his latest opera represents one of the most overt political statements of his career.The libretto by David Pountney – who also directs – collates three narratives of rebellion against a repressive system. In the first, baritone Adam Marsden represents James Meredith, who in 1962 became the first African American to register as a student of the University of Mississippi. In the second, set in Germany in 1942, members of the White Rose movement protest against the actions of the Nazi regime before being caught and executed – their rallying cry, addressing “fellow students”, gives the opera its arcane title. In the third, set during the Chinese Cultural Revolution, a young brother and sister denounce their “reactionary” parents, in whose subsequent officially-sponsored murder they are complicit.Fast moving in its presentation, the production is a punchy piece of theatre that proves surprisingly topical, even if its overall look and naive stance – there are obvious heroes and villains, with nothing in between – recall 1970s agit-prop.So does much of the score, wide-ranging and effective though its use of pastiche is, and drawing on the techniques of the memorable music theatre works that first brought Maxwell Davies to notoriety. Visually, this is a fine realisation, purposefully conducted by Jane Glover, though ultimately its simplistic viewpoint and air of nostalgia tell against it.

Vitellia seeks revenge for her father’s death by Tito’s father, but show signs of faltering under the moral fortitude of both Sesto and Tito. For his part, Tito craves the freedom to form uncomplicated friendships, which his position denies him. This is proved by his ultimate torment, that of having to choose whether to condemn Sesto for treason or pardon him as a friend.The strength of these dilemmas shines through James Conway’s production for ETO, in Andrew Porter’s English translation. Gillian Ramm’s Vitellia is coolly fierce, controlling Sesto more with a fiery temper than by feminine wiles. She makes an immediate and lasting impression vocally, even if there’s relatively little sense of her transformation.In Julia Riley’s portrayal, Sesto’s increasing guilt and despair is keenly heightened. And Mark Wilde paints Tito as an intriguingly ambiguous emperor, whose clemency may be as much the result of naivety as of unwavering principles.The updating to the 1930s adds little commentary and Neil Irish’s plain, brass-like back-wall design is pretty drab, though the stage is dominated for the most part by an imposing sculpture of Tito’s head, which appears smashed to pieces after the burning of the Capitol and Sesto’s apparently successful assassination of Tito.There’s real punch in the pit, with Richard Lewis pushing the tempos hard – just occasionally ramming the recitatives, but lacking nothing in momentum and revealing a seam of raw emotion.

Verdi’s popular ancient Egyptian epic falls into that category, though when David McVicar’s staging was new in 2010 it didn’t garner the universal welcome accorded to some of his more sure-fire shows at this address – Figaro and The Magic Flute, for example. For a start, its avoidance of specifically Egyptian imagery and substitution of mix’n’match motifs from the Aztecs to Afghanistan seems perverse. The semi-sexualised choreography for the ballet sequences looks ridiculous. And at this first revival, there is a low level of serious dramatic engagement from most of the principals.This is perhaps understandable given that the Aida, Ukrainian soprano Liudmyla Monastyrska, was only awarded the central role following the departure of Micaela Carosi after the general rehearsal. Monastyrska makes a more than decent vocal shot at the part, clearly knowing it well and certainly able to sing it, even if she is dramatically tentative. Her words barely register. Roberto Alagna sings a characteristically eager Radames, if not a subtle one, but rarely seems to connect with her.Michael Volle makes more sense of Amonasro and Olga Borodina’s Amneris has all guns blazing, producing the most convincing realisation on stage. Vitalij Kowaljow is an impressive Ramfis and Brindley Sherratt a vocally commanding King, though it’s easy to see that the power in this kingdom – wherever it’s supposed to be – resides with the priests.Fabio Luisi’s conducting needs more dramatic dynamism, too, but that’s the show’s general weak spot.

As the company’s director, James Conway notes, Suor Angelica – the third panel of Puccini’s triptych – is for another time.And a very good job it makes of these strikingly contrasting pieces. Conway himself directs the taut thriller Il Tabarro (The Cloak), set on a barge moored in the Seine, where barge owner Michele first suspects then murders his wife Giorgetta’s lover, Luigi. Julie Unwin fleshes out Giorgetta’s unhappiness, with Charne Rochford perfectly presenting her doomed romantic partner and Simon Thorpe excellent as her unloved husband. All three sing with passionate engagement. Neil Irish’s heavy, metal set gives us the industrial background and poverty of Puccini’s sombre creation.But Irish excels himself with the second piece, the brilliant comedy Gianni Schicchi, about a group of relatives circumventing the will of a recently dead relative but outwitted in turn by the eponymous hero. Irish presents us with a perfectly-realised bedroom in a comfortable household in Puccini’s time (updated from the original medieval setting), while Liam Steel’s direction is sharp and witty. The only fault is that the singers clearly realise they are in a comedy – it would be funnier if they took their collective situation entirely seriously.There are wonderful standouts from Paula Sides’ lyrical Lauretta and Ashley Catling’s alert Rinuccio, while Richard Mosley-Evans’ Schicchi is treasurable. Michael Rosewell conducts with a flawless sense of style and the orchestra is top-notch.

Despite – or because of – having given more than 150 performances of the role in various productions, Suart’s comedy is so naturally bound into the character. Camp but not hammy, physical but not slapstick, he is the dynamo that drives the cast and his dialogue soars into the auditorium, combining the dry irony of Ronnie Corbett with the effortless suaveness of Leslie Phillips; with side-curls constantly flailing, his energy is boundless. His latest ‘little list’ of those who ‘won’t be missed’ includes swipes at Wayne Rooney, Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary and Silvio Berlusconi (in a rhyme deftly pairing ‘hunger’ with ‘bunga bunga’).Suart’s sharpness perfectly matches the cool chic of the brilliant (and brilliantly lit) monochrome-cream sets by the late Stefanos Lazaridis, placing the action in a thirties art deco hotel. Small dancing troupes of chamber maids and camp bellboys flood the stage at a moment’s notice, and there’s an amusing routine for decapitated, penguin-suited nobles.Otherwise, this 25th-anniversary revival might seem less sprightly. Long-standing Mikado Richard Angas and Poo-Bah Donald Maxwell fail to ignite, and in the pit Peter Robinson controls the pace instinctively but could draw more sparkle from the players. However, heart-throb crossover tenor Alfie Boe and soprano Sophie Bevan make a dashing central couple as Nanki-Poo and Yum-Yum, both of them contrasting wide-eyed innocence with moments of touching reflection. Judging by the enthusiastic reception by the audience, this quarter-century revival still hits the spot.

This UK premiere of its full version (a shorter form appeared at Opera Holland Park last year) features a fine cast and a striking, swirling, knotted wood, designed by Neil Irish, which envelops a revolving foxes’ den. The costumes are equally colourful, and the music and staging work hand in hand in distinguishing between the ground-level human world and the subterranean foxes’ den.The trio of mean farmers, Boggis, Bunce and Bean, are less grotesque than as depicted by Dahl and Quentin Blake, but are sharply characterised, not least in Mark Wilde’s gambolling, Gallicised Bunce. In the pitless Ashcroft theatre, Picker’s new orchestration sometimes obscured the singers – a problem most venues won’t have – but it emphasised a wordy libretto which can be taxing to sing intelligibly.The production successfully blends in local primary school children (as it will throughout the tour) who provide the cute chorus of trees (matched by suitably moonlit music) and six of the eight fox cubs.Picker’s music steers a middle course – neither aiming at a young audience in clearly defining the characters, yet sounding slightly reined in. And the klezmer-style inflections, most prevalent in the sage Rita Rat’s set-piece (ably sung by Caryl Hughes) are bafflingBut the opera still carries an entertaining narrative, and also espouses broader issues, such as the comfort of the family unit, loneliness and companionship (in Hedgehog and Porcupine’s romance) and Fox’s sense of emasculation after his tail is shot off.

The associate director is Dan Dooner. As in many modern productions, the work’s dodgier aspects are carefully side-stepped. In the final act, Lehnhoff’s usual set designer Raimund Bauer presents us with a length of railway track going somewhere but probably not, or not specifically, to Auschwitz. It could be the path to salvation. In Act I Wagner’s Teutonic warriors are rendered as vaguely Oriental monks inhabiting what looks and occasionally sounds like a cement works. The flower maidens of Act II are notably unalluring, images of the natural world being rigorously eschewed throughout. The rapturous musical invention of Act III (Mark Wigglesworth’s orchestra at last rising splendidly to the occasion) is contradicted by a directorial concept that traps us in a post-cataclysmic endgame of Beckettian non-specificity and nihilism. We never see the grail.The consistently grey stage is dominated by John Tomlinson’s Gurnemanz, inspiring still in a role he has sung many times though not previously in English. Doing such a piece in the vernacular creates problems elsewhere. Tom Fox’s Klingsor is decently sung but his vowels are distractingly American. And could not translator Richard Stokes have avoided the titters which greet Kundry’s Act III saloon bar cry of “service, service?” In that demanding role, Jane Dutton, a late substitute, proves herself at the very least a determined trouper. Like Stuart Skelton’s physically robust Parsifal, she is hideously costumed (by Andrea Schmidt-Futterer). Iain Paterson’s tortured Amfortas is a shapeless terracotta warrior – Andrew Greenan’s noble-sounding Titurel wears Dr Who monster chainmail.

A satire on the modern cult of celebrity and one of its highest flying victims, the narrative is sharply presented by Jones in his familiar comic-grotesque style. Miriam Buether’s sets and Nicky Gillibrand’s costumes move back and forth from trashiness to would-be chic with sassy ease.If only the material itself were stronger. Thomas’s text, though, is banal, offering the characters no more than a cartoonish one-dimensionality and presenting the action in a sequence of cliches. At his best, a major talent, Turnage here seems content to set the libretto without giving it the resonance or ambiguity that might have humanised it or deepened its moral outlook. The style blends various pop/jazz idioms into a classical frame, but the parodies are unmemorable and little of the score registers with distinction. Ultimately, and disappointingly, it’s an evening that rarely rises above the cheap-laugh potential of its subject.Remarkable, though, is Eva-Maria Westbroek’s presentation of Anna Nicole, wearing her tawdriness with flair, and Alan Oke’s J Howard Marshall II, who comes over, rather surprisingly, as the most sympathetic character in a heartless piece.

But Orlando also possesses one of Handel’s finest scores, a treasure chest of memorable arias, all in his best and most immediately appealing vein.Dramatically, too, it’s a winner. The plot derives from the poetic epic by Ludovico Ariosto, in which the hero has abandoned heroic deeds and spends most of the opera hopelessly in love with Angelica, whose lack of interest in him eventually drives him mad. By the end he is cured and ready to go back into battle.Cleverly designed by Yannis Thavoris, Harry Fehr’s production pushes the action forward to a London hospital just before the Blitz, where Orlando becomes an RAF pilot too depressed to do his duty and fight for his country, and Handel’s magician is a doctor charged with curing him. Andrzej Goulding’s projections remind Orlando (and the audience) of the choice between love and duty recently made by Edward VIII. Though there’s some physical resemblance here between Orlando and Angelica and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, this is sensibly not pushed too far. The result is a stimulating and well executed staging.The singing, too, reaches a high standard, with countertenor Tim Mead fluent and sensitive as Orlando, though not always cutting through. Claire Booth’s Dorinda is a charmer, though she needs clearer enunciation, and Sally Silver’s flamboyant Angelica shows enormous flair. Paul Goodwin conducts a pacy, detailed performance, with excellent playing from the orchestra.

Thomas Rosner conducts the on-form orchestra with the lightest of touches, bringing out the full piquant Viennese charm of this bitter-sweet romp.The updated version by David Pountney and Leonard Hancock (sung and acted in English, with English surtitles for the songs, plus Welsh for venues in Wales) moves the intricate plot along at commendable pace with witty asides and topical references, while downplaying the decadent amorality with an innocent gloss. John Copley’s uncluttered direction and sight gags are stylishly self-assured, set off by high society costumes by Deirdre Clancy and attractive settings by Tim Reed.Nuccia Focile is an excellent coquettish Rosalinde, well matched by Mark Stone as her roving-eyed husband Eisenstein – the sexual chemistry between them palpable. Paul Charles Clarke’s over-the-top Italianate tenor Alfred provides great fun for opera buffs, while Joanne Boag makes much of the ambitious maid Adele. Notably in support are David Stout as Falke the hoaxer Bat, Alan Opie as the eccentric prison governor Frank, Carthaigh Quill as the stuttering accident-prone lawyer Blind and Helen Lepalaan as the bored Russian aristocrat Orlofsky.Truly memorable is the stand-up out-front comic performance of Desmond Barrit as the hopelessly inebriated jailer Frosch, gathering laughs with everything he says and does in this melody-filled, warm-hearted entertainment. Operetta at its very best.

Coad oozes flirty confidence, but also captures the depth of her moral dilemma and of her genuine love for the dishy Paris. A flexible soprano with an instinct for drama, she could soon be high-profile. Christopher Diffey shows great charm and vocal stamina as Paris, while David Menezes sportingly plays the downtrodden, BlackBerry-besotted Menelaus.Signalling where Helen’s dream begins and ends is the main flaw in the staging (especially given a pre-existing dream in the original operetta’s Act II), but in terms of comic appeal, Harvey delivers what you might hope for from one half of the cabaret duo Kit and Widow. The Greek gods’ game of charades becomes a name that tune quiz of popular classical themes – Ajax 2 is an amusing hand-puppet attached to Ajax 1, and Orestes (brilliantly played by Anthony Flaum) is a chick loving hip hop DJ.The ‘orchestra’ of six instruments plus piano under Stephen Hose’s direction negotiates its way through Offenbach’s often frothy score with vim. With its talented and enthusiastic cast, this entertaining, intimate operatic venture deserves to do well on its ten-stop tour.

The Polish-born composer (1919-96) lost most of his family in the Holocaust but himself managed to flee to the Soviet Union. During a chequered career, he gained the friendship of Shostakovich and other important musicians but was largely sidelined creatively. In recent years there’s been renewed interest in his music internationally, including his seven operas.The Portrait was premiered in Brno in 1983. Based on a short story by Gogol, it charts the career of the unsuccessful painter Chartkov, who buys a portrait that turns out, literally, to pour forth money. Sacrificing his artistic integrity, he becomes the favourite painter of St Petersburg society, but eventually realises the hollowness of his achievement on seeing an exhibition by a truly great artist.This satire on art and society is delivered by director David Pountney and designer Dan Potra with an appropriate blend of the surreal, the comic and the grotesque, taking us from the original nineteenth-century setting through the period of Stalin and on to Andy Warhol. Paul Nilon pulls out all the stops in the demanding title role, dominating the evening while being impressively bolstered by the large and talented supporting cast.Yet the score itself is uneven. Highly eclectic in style, it veers from the folksy through various twentieth-century idioms, losing cohesion and consistency on the way, though conductor Rossen Gergov and Opera North’s orchestra give it all they’ve got.

John MacFarlane’s handsome 18th-century sets provide monumentality, colour and mystery, and the comic element is well served by some crisp performances and nicely paced dialogue.Kate Royal is once again a Pamina of finely shaped vocalism and strong character. Canadian tenor Joseph Kaiser – new to this staging, though he sang Tamino in the Kenneth Branagh film of the opera – offers bright tone and complete dramatic assurance. Jessica Pratt debuts as the Queen of the Night, supplying physical authority and all the money notes.So, too, at the opposite end of the vocal range, does Franz-Josef Selig, whose resplendent bass is matched by his physical grandeur as Sarastro. Matthew Best is a sonorous Speaker, and all the secondary roles are skilfully presented – notably Peter Hoare’s comic-grotesque Monostatos and Irish soprano Anna Devin’s perky Papagena.Two marvellous artists make particularly outstanding contributions to the evening. One is baritone Christopher Maltman, whose Papageno is impeccably sung and both genuinely funny and deeply touching in his humanity. The other is the Royal Opera’s former music director, Colin Davis, who conducts. Now 83, Davis brings the same precision and refinement to his performance that have long made his Mozart special, and these days there’s a warmth and wisdom to his interpretation that shine out of the orchestra pit. It’s altogether a very superior account of the opera, and a treat for both eyes and ears.

The material, based on a play by Victor Hugo set in Donizetti’s characteristically flamboyant and vocally iron-pumping style, is strong. But Figgis shows little ability to enliven it with interaction or even action. It’s a long time since such a static, inert and at times inept realisation of a classic work took to the Coliseum stage.Figgis supplies some additions to the score in the shape of short films that precede, rather than specifically introducing, each scene. These represent his most assured contribution to the evening, though they inevitably hinder the piece’s musical momentum and at times seem seriously tangential. Their big-budget glamour also upstages Es Devlin’s meagre sets.Not all is lost, however. The cast is never less than solid and at best impressive. Claire Rutter coasts her way through the title role unscathed, though makes little of the character. Michael Fabiano sings Gennaro with lyric warmth. As Lucrezia’s repulsive husband, Alastair Miles is an appreciable asset. Why Elizabeth DeShong plays the trouser-role of Gennaro’s buddy Maffio Orsini as a girl remains mysterious. All of them, as well as the chorus, would have benefited from direction by a skilled operatic hand, and from more energised conducting than Paul Daniel supplies.

Daniel Kramer’s Opera North staging, set in the contemporary Midwest but sung in French, equips the Toreador Escamillo with a star fighting dog and a drink problem, while excising marching urchins, smugglers, and the parade of bullfighters to the bullring.Micaela in a Basque blue frock and acres of green eye-shadow totes a gun in Act III.The passing Seville crowds seem to be on an outing from an old people’s home, though all strip down to their undies for a wedding scene of sorts at Lillas Pastia’s bar, ending with Keel Watson’s Zuniga strung up in a wedding head-dress. This expanded Zuniga is nastier than usual as a sadistic corrupt police boss who beats up Carmen – does Kramer want us to be sorry for her?The final row with Jos? suggests ritualised sacrifice – though the crucial thing about Carmen is its eye-balling lack of sentimentality. Jose’s final stab is a samurai-like dash.Kramer cuts all the spoken dialogue except the odd new line of bland explaining. He turns Jose into a wimp, preferring bald cliches to developing characters that convince. Unlike his model Calixto Bieito, the violence is not executed credibly and the attention-seeking ‘realistic’ acting makes little sense.Heather Shipp’s sexy Carmen exposes her breasts to entice Peter Auty’s stolid Jose in buff-coloured shorts. Neither’s singing is charismatic or punchy. Kostas Smoriginas’s Escamillo sounds decent, but Kramer ignores the whole issue of challenged honour and identity. As Micaela Anne Sophie Duprels isn’t pure-sounding or youthful enough. Conductor Andreas Delfs happily brings delicacy and restraint to the finely-played orchestral accompaniment, so Bizet’s universe can be relished whatever the vulgarity.

Bruno Pratico (Doctor Bartolo) dazzles in the patter section of A un dottor della mia sorte in Act I and Ildar Abdrazakov retains the slitheriness and faux-mysticism of Don Basilio, imagining the slander with which he proposes to taint Almaviva as if a love object. Most impressive of all is Polish soprano Aleksandra Kurzak, whose unforced high coloratura presents itself with crystalline clarity and with agility to match.But there’s a distinct limpness to the comic component of the piece under revival director Justin Way – the first real laugh coming with the dart-throwing Rosina’s Una voce poco fa, 50 minutes into the opera – and, although highly competent, Rory Macdonald in the pit doesn’t release the flair in Rossini’s score.Set and costume designs (by Christian Fenouillat and Agostino Cavalca respectively) are brightly coloured but uncluttered, but the hydraulic shake and tilt action of the entire set in the Act I finale (reflecting the giddy confusion of the entire ensemble) hijacks rather than intensifies the drama.

The company’s new production of Madam Butterfly (or Bangkok Butterfly) goes a step further in chiselling a contemporary edge.Butterfly is transformed from a Nagasaki geisha girl to a Bangkok ladyboy, and her predatory lover, the US Navy lieutenant Pinkerton, becomes an American Airlines pilot. But there’s nothing masculine, camp or vulgar about this supposedly shemale Butterfly-for-rent, sung by Margaret Cooper with a good deal of vocal and dramatic expression.The only real edge here is Pinkerton’s attraction to Butterfly possessing the “heart of a boy but the soul of a woman” and to her being “firm like a boy in all the right places”. And the plot takes a tumble when Pinkerton and his new American wife still come to take Butterfly’s son away for a better life in the USA – even though, in this version, he is not even Pinkerton and Butterfly’s son, but instead the son of Butterfly’s recently deceased sister.The mostly impressive cast is let down by Mario Sofroniou’s wooden Pinkerton – lyrically depleted and limited in character. By contrast, Alison Dunne produces rich tonal depth as the maid Suzuki and radiates tacit expression with a face that speaks as clearly as a Greek chorus. Oliver Gibbs also makes an impression as Sharpless, Pinkerton’s friend and conscience.If reducing an orchestral score by one of opera’s greatest colourists leads to inevitable compromise, the piano, clarinet and viola trio still do not always get to the heart of the music’s tangled emotion.

Hansel and Gretel’s trapezoid-framed bedroom, set within the forest, may seem unprepossessing, but the forest itself shifts in mood from a source of wonderment to one of menace. In the children’s dream sequence the directors call upon squirrel-headed white angels with illuminated wings while the impoverished parents are imagined in a warm, well-appointed home, the climax arriving as the children chomp away on dreamy hunger-sating sandwiches. Then a pantomime Barbie-like Dew Fairy arrives, rubber-gloved, with her trolley of brushes to sweep away the final vestiges of night.Disappointingly, though, the production neither offers any particular psychological angle on the tale, nor does it give full rein to the humour. However, the Witch’s kitchen is a coup, with children hanging from meat hooks at the rear and two looming industrial-sized ovens to the right. In go the children, out come child-sized gingerbread girls and boys, baked to perfection. Having received a taste of her own medicine, the Witch too emerges as a (more or less) life-sized doughy confection.The cast is strong: Christine Rice’s glowing mezzo lends a boyish masculinity to Hansel, while Ailish Tynan’ s agile tone brings lightness to Gretel, whom she acts with child-like, pre-feminine charm. Vocally, Yvonne Howard manages to counter the dowdy attire of the mother, and Thomas Allen is predictably assured as the father. In the pit, Rory MacDonald shows he can cast a light touch, but is less convincing in conveying the score’s rich German Romanticism.

That’s a surprisingly long gap, but the excellence of Tim Albery’s staging and the top-notch quality of its music-making look likely to ensure that Tannhauser is well and truly re-launched.Albery’s skilled and economical opera direction means that such a potentially static scene as the second act, when Tannhauser shocks the assembled courtiers at the Wartburg singing contest by praising the decadent delights he has experienced in the Venusberg, makes a striking impact. Wagner’s conservative society is represented here by gun-toting warlords and their followers, as in newsreel images of the Balkan wars or the Chechen conflict. Michael Levine’s set offers a theatrical Venusberg, with a smaller reproduction of the Covent Garden proscenium and curtain that has been wrecked by Act 2 and is a sorry, ruined fragment by Act 3. Wonderfully executed by a group of twelve dancers, Jasmin Vardimon’s choreography for the sensual Venusberg ballet is vital and exciting in another scene that rises to a difficult challenge. (The opera is performed in its final, Vienna edition.)The cast is strong from top to bottom. Discretely costumed by Jon Morrell, tenor Johan Botha scythes his way tirelessly through the title role, his tone consistently bold and gleaming. Eva-Maria Westbroek charts the depth of feeling of the saintly Elisabeth with unerring intelligence. Michaela Schuster’s plush mezzo has never sounded better on this stage as hieratic, iconic Venus. Christian Gerhaher’s absolute vocal mastery and keen acting make his Royal Opera debut as Wolfram unforgettable. Christof Fischesser’s firm Landgrave is another asset.Micro-managed down to the last detail, Semyon Bychkov’s conducting is immaculately shaped, setting the crown on one of Covent Garden’s great evenings.

Director John Savournin also sings Captain Corcoran and makes every slight facial gesture tell in this intimate venue. However, his words are not always as spry.Rosie Strobel is a buxom, larger than life West Country Little Buttercup who turns Kate Bush-mystic in Things Are Seldom What They Seem. Ian Belsey’s Sir Joseph is keenly observed and suavely executed – a camp and faltering patricianIn this scaled-down, chorus-less version, Sir Joseph’s ‘sisters and his cousins and his aunts’ become singular of type – the sister and cousin bounding around with near-manic energy, the aunt carried by them in the form of ashes in an urn. As a comic romp the performances are near-faultless, yet the true love of the lowly sailor Ralph Rackstraw (David Menezes) shines through with its touching drama.The ‘band’ comprises the Eaton-Young piano duo seated at a small grand piano. They combine a kind of suppleness that would likely elude most orchestras, with an ardour for the score that would almost certainly do the same. It’s well worth booking for this Pinafore before it leaves harbour.

Seeing the opera, the ban is not surprising.The story describes a dog becoming a man after a grotesque operation. The dog then proves far more dangerous and even more morally disgusting as a human. A biting allegorical satire on the recently established Soviet regime, on human nature and specifically on the proletariat, it is easy to see why the story fell foul of Soviet censorship.The story is brilliantly presented in McBurney’s virtuoso staging. The director uses a thrillingly wide range of theatrical devices to articulate the seriously dark yet humorous narrative.Blind Summit Theatre’s puppetry recreates Sharik, the scrawny, ill-treated hound that transforms into Sharikov the man. Designs by Michael Levine (sets) and Christina Cunningham (costumes), together with Finn Ross’s projections, depict the locale of 1920s Moscow with surreal pungency.There are outstanding performances from many in the large cast, especially Steven Page as the surgeon who performs the operation and Peter Hoare as the monster he unleashes. Visually, this is a production of exceptional quality.Yet despite the excellence of the cast and Garry Walker’s cogent conducting, Raskatov’s score is disappointingly thin – often little more than a sequence of meagre and fleeting effects, lacking the richness and resources that might have turned this hugely promising material into a genuinely great opera.

Here, the historic diva is sung by Angela Gheorghiu, who makes surprisingly little of some of the big dramatic opportunities offered and sounds less than lavish in her famous opening aria, though elsewhere her silvery tone and shapely line are major assets. She is vividly partnered as her lover, the politically ambitious Maurizio, by Jonas Kaufmann, one of today’s greatest tenors, in ringing voice and fully engaged dramatically, though the rich Latin tone ideally required is arguably not his to command. Michaela Schuster’s grand manner defines the haughty Princess of Bouillon, whose enmity for Adriana results in her death through poisoned violets. Alessandro Corbelli gives the evening’s most detailed performance as Michonnet, stage manager of the Comedie-Francaise, whose unselfish love for Adriana is not returned.Yet the overall impact is less than it should be. Charles Edwards’ sets and Brigitte Reiffenstuel’s costumes expertly conjure the period locale, and McVicar’s staging goes through the motions without engaging with the material in any profound way. Cilea may not be Puccini – his range and technical skills are at a much lower level – but more charm, wit and authentic passion would deliver his piece more convincingly, though conductor Mark Elder proves a conscientious presence in the pit.

Thanks to a Harold Child libretto replete with folksy, Cotswold village archetypes, it is rarely staged by the big companies and the present revival, which plays up the neighbourhood element by deploying a children’s chorus drawn from local schools, is well worth catching. The score, always strongly melodic and hinting at more familiar Vaughan Williams, includes some radiant music for Hugh, a benign (and here bewigged) proto-Peter Grimes, sung by the experienced tenor Daniel Norman, and Mary, his rebellious love interest, a fine portrayal from the young Australian soprano Celeste Lazarenko. The professional, mainly Anglo-Australian cast also boasts rising baritone Grant Doyle as both the Johnny Depp-style showman and a stentorian sergeant.Yann Seabra’s accessible design favours simple wooden forms, while signalling the lure of a freer natural world beyond rigid communal boundaries. The key props are a gibbet and the village stocks. The central fight is choreographed with conviction and only the show’s downbeat ending runs counter to the text. On opening night with Simon Thorpe unwell, the role of John the Butcher was bravely sung in from the side of the stage by Adrian Powter – the chorus sounded nervous. There are four more performances with which to celebrate New Sussex Opera’s commitment to indigenous music theatre without public subsidy. The orchestral texture is sensitively handled by a 33-piece ensemble under Nicholas Jenkins.

The milieu is vaguely contemporary – an incomplete Docklands redevelopment perhaps – with rich and poor living cheek by jowl beneath a crown-of-thorns corona of disco lights. At ground level, Ian MacNeil’s geometric mini-sets, redolent of urban decay and dodgy interior design, are manhandled by a hyperactive troupe of masked devils. Conceptually unfocused perhaps but of a piece with Jeremy Sams’s free translation which goes all out for laughs at the expense of context, morality or character development. Leporello’s famous catalogue of his master’s conquests is rewritten as a ‘spreadsheet’ aria with back-projected graphs. The key text is Giovanni’s Life is a party. Life is a game. And, for a time, it works.In the pit, the much-touted Kirill Karabits has a mixed night – his overture is fuzzy although the rest of Act I goes with appropriate vigour. Standing in for an indisposed Rebecca Evans, Sarah Redgwick shines brightly as Donna Elvira before tiring amid the general disarray. Sarah Tynan is an unaffected Zerlina while Katherine Broderick, a buxom Wagnerian strangely cast, acts her socks off as Donna Anna. The production does not allow Iain Paterson to display his suave side in the title role and relies on regional accents for Brindley Sherratt’s dark, firmly sung Leporello and John Molloy’s put-upon Masetto. Matthew Best’s sonorous Commendatore is a plus even if the director has no idea what to do with him.

Scottish Opera emerging artist Nadine Livingston immediately excerpts her authority as Susanna while Thomas Oliemans, returning to the role of Figaro, gives his lilting voice free reign to glide through the music.It is flash stuff, with Ulrike Mayer getting the horny teenage lust of Cherabino down pat as he thrusts himself upon anything in a skirt and Roderick Williams displaying the older-man’s version of such attitudes as the irrepressibly randy Count Almaviva.The shade comes with Act II and Kate Valentine’s exquisitely melancholy opening aria of regret – sung to a child standing statue-like, their back to the audience in the centre of Simon Higlett’s tall, unfussy design. As the comedy of the Act in the Countess’s bedroom plays out, Allen picks out the chinks of depth to the characters, while reminding that it is the Countess who is the real victim here.It is a production which nods knowingly to the unlikely plot devises, and finds strength right down the cast. Francesco Facini is particularly notable in the tongue-twisting role of Dr Bartolo.

It proves a worthwhile venture from all points of view.Haydn’s 1779 score sets a text by the leading opera librettist Metastasio against action played out on the desert island of the title. Costanza and her sister Silvia have been abandoned there, so they believe, by Costanza’s husband Gernando, and left for 13 years. In fact, Gernando was abducted by pirates and sold into slavery, from which he escapes to seek his wife in the company of his friend Enrico. It’s a simpler set-up than many of Haydn’s works, and the music itself, including an overture written in his pre-Romantic ‘storm and stress’ manner and powerful accompanied recitatives, is near the top of his operatic range.The piece comes to the ROH for the first time in this staging by the Greek director Rodula Gaitanou. Her staging, played in Jamie Vartan’s effectively grungy and distressed set, has a couple of moments of excessive hyperactivity – the two women limp and twitch a little too much – but generally delivers the narrative and characterisations skilfully.Elisabeth Meister’s warm-toned Costanza is an asset, nicely offset by Anna Devin’s flakier but attractively sung younger sister Silvia. Steven Ebel is a purposeful Gernando and Daniel Grice a determined Enrico. The piece comes over strongly musically, thanks to conductor Volker Krafft and the excellent Southbank Sinfonia in the pit.

Its unashamed vulgarity and frivolity, and the saucy frocks, will give audiences a much-needed boost in these gloomy times. The cheering and collective joy as the men dance a high kicking, music hall chorus is wonderful to witness.Stephanie Corley makes her Opera North debut in the title role and she looks ravishing. Ravishing enough to have this reviewer sitting bolt upright. She sings rather well too. Her Widow is a gorgeous creature, sexy and sensible, a mix of city glamour and country girl vowels. As Valencienne, the Ambassador’s wife and former chorus girl, Amy Freston is a sparkling, vivacious revelation and boy can she cancan.Ace wordsmith Kit Hesketh-Harvey has been drafted in to translate, along with ON’s Giles Havergal, and to give the dialogue some fizz. With a plot about a mythical Balkan country’s financial perils, he has a glorious time. Happily just about all of his lines can be heard.The choreography, from Stuart Hopps, has lots of neat and nimble footwork, and surprising cartwheels, but in one or two scenes the stage is looking overly crowded. No bumping or bruising as yet.Altogether a timely reminder of why The Merry Widow has remained so popular. Even conductor Wyn Davies shows nifty side steps as he comes on stage to take his bow.

We are in the thirties Paris of Cartier-Bresson, and Jean Kalman’s lighting is photograph-flat. Isabella Bywater’s zinc-grey set is certainly handsome – a two-storey, two-unit construction which revolves to give us the artists’ garret, the Cafe Momus and a suggestion of the streets beyond. The drawback is that key scenes have to be played at a considerable height, robbing them of intimacy. With the director determined to show us a band of rather ordinary young people, without too much emblematic social, emotional (or even merely physical) connection, any allusion to our own economic slide remains disappointingly low-key and our heroine dies in a chair so physically remote that the associated stage business feels redundant. No matter. The score itself provides firmly focused theatre, even if conductor Stephen Lord can be sluggish in his pursuit of emotional verisimilitude.The singing is only so-so. Gwyn Hughes Jones is a chunky Welsh rugby prop of a Rodolfo, while rising star Elizabeth Llewellyn (winner of the inaugural Voice of Black Opera competition) makes a bigger splash with her house debut as Mimi. She might have been less vocally stretched as Musetta but the sumptuousness of her lower register promises great things. There are some detailed pantomimic character portraits, the most persuasive being the flustered old Benoit of Simon Butteriss. Richard Angas’s preposterously barking Alcindoro should be retired however. Designed for singability rather than genuine wit, Amanda Holden’s new rhyming translation is at pains to avoid the obvious, hence – “This hand of yours is freezing.” The coolness threatens to extend to the evening as a whole.

This season departs from tradition in returning to Smetana’s 1876 comedy, which was played in English in 1974. In the event it seems entirely forgivable that the current artistic director, David Agler, should want to revisit this charming piece, sung this time in the original Czech.The Kiss almost never appears outside the Czech Republic, although it is just as delectable as the much better known Bartered Bride or even The Two Widows. The story tells of the recently widowed farmer Lukas, returning to his first love, Vendulka, after his wife’s death. Their romance seems to be successfully renewed until he demands a kiss, which she refuses so soon after his loss. A small matter becomes a big disagreement, and the rest of the action describes how the contretemps is eventually resolved with the inevitable, if belated, kiss.Though the premise seems slight, Smetana charts the humanity and reality of his 19th-century village characters with depth. The subtle and entrancing score comes over marvellously with the Wexford Festival Orchestra on superb form, under the gifted young Czech conductor Jaroslav Kyzlink. South African soprano Pumeza Matshikiza adds further to her rising reputation with her beautifully sung and acted Vendulka, with Peter Berger bold and bracing as the more volatile Lukas – but there are no weak links in the cast.To unfailingly clever and attractive designs by James Macnamara and Fabio Toblini, Michael Gieleta’s staging is flawlessly judged.

This year, that partnership manages another local first with The Golden Ticket, its libretto derived from Roald Dahl’s 1964 children’s classic Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Unfortunately, Peter Ash’s score for the new piece, unveiled in St Louis in June, has no more substance than Corigliano’s proved to have last season.Much of the evening works – at least visually. Bruno Schwengl’s complex sets and Martin Pakledinaz’s costumes offer cleverness and dark humour in purveying Dahl’s strange and disturbing dream world of childish fantasy consumption and a rough kind of moral retribution. Donald Sturrock’s libretto supplies a narrative flow, though it’s sometimes a slow-moving one. James Robinson’s production is inventive. The cast delivers in terms of the one-dimensional parodies the awful kids (apart from Charlie) and their awful parents present as dreadful warnings.Yet it’s hard to know who this show is aimed at. Both Wexford and St Louis audiences, not to mention those in other opera houses, are pretty much all adult – yet there’s a strong feeling of a kid’s show about this entire project. Nothing wrong with that, of course, but where were the kids?Where, too, is Peter Ash’s style as a composer? Half-remembered bits of innumerable 20th century composers – Puccini, Ravel, Strauss, Britten, Berg et al – do not make an opera in themselves. Ultimately, it’s the evening’s musical thinness that weighs heavily against its amiable visuals and drags it down.

Virginia has a particularly interesting history. Composed in 1851 to a story that shows an ancient Roman patrician, Appio, abusing his power in order to claim the love of the plebeian Virginia, it fell foul of the censors. Unlike most of his colleagues, who would reluctantly make changes to allow their works to be performed, Mercadante stuck to his guns and held on to the score for 15 years, until it was finally released in 1866.It registers here, in a focused production by Kevin Newbury, as a lost masterpiece, dealing with the theme of injustice in a stark and potent way. Allen Moyer’s designs, incorporating elements from the ancient and modern worlds, work brilliantly.Wexford has also found an unbeatable cast for this powerful and vocally demanding piece. In the title role, American soprano Angela Meade shows a comprehensively strong vocal technique and much expressive refinement. She is expertly partnered by two exceptional young tenors – Sicilian Ivan Magri as the villainous Appio and the Portuguese Bruno Ribeiro as her lover Icilio. US baritone Hugh Russell is moving as Virginia’s father, whose final gesture in the piece is to stab his daughter rather than let her enemy take her. Marvellously conducted by the young Venezuelan Carlos Izcaray, the opera makes a thrilling opening night and shows Wexford at its absolute best.

No surprise, then, that it should have been a wildly popular success in its day – an even bigger box-office draw in Georgian England than John Gay’s Beggar’s Opera (performed 75 times in its first season as opposed to the Beggar’s Opera’s 63). Byron called it “the best opera ever written”.Yet after staying in the repertory for over 70 years, Sheridan’s comedy fell so far out of fashion that it could only muster two stagings in the 20th century. Which makes English Touring Opera’s new production a welcome act of theatrical resuscitation.By staging The Duenna at the Royal Opera House (in the Linbury Studio) and then taking it on tour, ETO is retracing the work’s earliest steps – it was first performed at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden in 1775, the same year as Sheridan’s hit play The Rivals (itself currently on tour in Peter Hall’s acclaimed new production). Over the following decades, however, large parts of the author’s original text were chopped and changed beyond recognition. ETO’s new production, carefully reconstructed from recently discovered manuscripts, is the first time the opera has been performed in its original form for over 230 years.Strictly speaking, The Duenna isn’t an opera, but something closer to a singspiel (like Mozart’s The Magic Flute). More than half the work is spoken dialogue – the remainder is set to arrangements of ballads and folk songs, and to original music composed by Sheridan’s father-in-law and brother-in-law, both called Thomas Linley. Only 19 when he composed his (lion’s) share of the music, Linley Jr was dubbed the English Mozart. He died, aged 22, in a boating accident three years later – a tragic loss for English music.Concocted in this fashion, you might expect The Duenna to be a musical and theatrical mishmash, but in Michael Barker-Caven’s production, conducted from the harpsichord by Joseph McHardy, it all hangs together surprisingly well. Adam Wiltshire’s simple, but ingenious stage design helps enormously. Constructed around a series of frames and screens, modelled on Baroque architectural drawings, it sets off the performances to striking effect and pulls together the separate strands of the play’s farcical and complex intrigue.Echoing Sheridan’s own life, the plot revolves around a dual elopement (famously, Sheridan had not long previously eloped with Tom Linley’s sister, Elizabeth). A pair of young lovers outwit a father and an ageing would-be suitor with the aid of a wily chaperone, the duenna of the title, roguishly played by Nuala Willis.If the plot sees the younger generation triumph, on stage it is the older performers who come out on top. Adrian Thompson gets laughs aplenty from the elderly beau’s vanity and folly, but doesn’t make him solely a figure of ridicule (tactfully, the production removes all references to the character’s Jewishness). Richard Suart is, if anything, even funnier as the splenetic, blustering father. Of the young lovers, Charlotte Page’s perky schemer Louisa is the standout, both vocally and dramatically.Like Page and Suart, well-known for his Gilbert and Sullivan patter roles, several of the cast have experience with D’Oyly Carte and it’s striking how often The Duenna anticipates Gilbert and Sullivan in its rhythms and mood. Looking back, however, Sheridan’s comedy draws on the traditions of commedia dell’arte, and Barker-Caven underscores the debt through the supple figure of Adam Tunnicliffe’s masquerader, who haunts much of the action.In places, the acting is more assured than the singing, and the ETO Baroque Orchestra, performing behind the stage, sometimes lag behind the action (erratic tuning is also a problem). Indeed, the whole production could be brisker (at nearly three hours, it’s at least half an hour overlong). Expect the show to pick up pace as the tour progresses.

Rossini’s orchestra is replaced by an upright piano, played with accomplishment by musical director Alison Luz.What makes the production a success is the comic interaction amongst the ensemble. Gareth Dafydd Morris’s Marquis, though he over-saturates the room vocally, is hilarious when returning to woo Rosina in the guise of a camp, lisping Spanish music teacher.Richard Immergluck is a convincing Figaro, Salisbury’s premier barber and matchmaker, and amusingly works his way around the audience in his first aria.Booming bass David Freedman makes for an eccentric Mr Basil (Don Basilio), almost disturbingly aroused by his plan to force Figaro out of town on a wave of slander.But while Dickon Gough steals the show dramatically with an acutely judged, effete, whimpering and occasionally creepy Dr Bartley (Bartolo), Belinda Evans is perfectly coquettish as Rosina and successfully masks the role’s towering vocal challenges.Being at the back of a pub perhaps helped, but there’s no doubt the show went down well with the audience.

Sutherland sang at this address between 1952 and 1990, including the role of Gilda, which she first performed at Covent Garden in 1957. And whether the Australian diva would have liked Michael Vale’s ugly sets for the current staging, one can’t say, but they don’t improve on renewed acquaintance. Nor does David McVicar’s 2001 production, which is getting fuzzy around the edges. Maybe time to think about a replacement.Yet the evening has an outstanding performance at its centre. Dmitri Hvorostovsky is a seasoned and traditional interpreter of the title role of Verdi’s tormenting and tormented jester, a part he conceives on the grandest scale and performs to considerable effect. Maintaining the complex physicality of the role throughout a no-holds-barred assumption, he brings distinction to the evening.Patrizia Ciofi’s Gilda also possesses considerable vocal authority and is committed, even if she’s a little mature to play the ingenue. As the dissipated Duke, Korean tenor Wookyung Kim offers liquid vocalism if less dramatic focus. American bass Raymond Aceto once again impresses as a menacing Sparafucile, with Daniela Innamorati memorable as his sluttish sister, Maddalena. In a smaller role, Elizabeth Sikora’s knowing Giovanna also hits the mark.Making his Royal Opera debut is Israeli conductor Dan Ettinger, who delivers an above routine account, though hardly a gripping one.

The only other option is alchemy, which is what Lynne Hockney has mastered, returning for a second time to direct Sir Peter Hall’s La Cenerentola (new in 2005) for Glyndebourne on Tour.Jonathan Veira’s pot-bellied Don Magnifico and Luciano Botelho’s truth-seeking Prince Ramiro are the twin fulcrums around which the remainder of the cast pivots – the former disarmingly deft in the tiniest gesture (and with vocal apparatus to match), the latter a Brazilian tenor perfectly cast as Cinderella’s suitor. His effusive, honeyed upper range is beguiling and, while he may not yet rival the sheer agility of a Juan Diego Florez, the effortless tone-colour is similarly special. Joan Martin-Royo’s Dandini strings the preening ‘ugly’ sisters along a treat – their jaw-dropping increasing as their rejection becomes ever clearer – and Allyson McHardy’s Cenerentola marries a rich, oaky bottom register with decent agility up top. The vertically unchallenged Paul Whelan makes an almost sculptural presence as Ramiro’s tutor Alidoro, the sage architect of Cinderella’s journey to the throne, gushing vocal richness to match his height. But across the entire ensemble cast there’s discipline and freedom held in delicious balance, a feature directly reflected in Enrique Mazzola’s conducting, which delivers rapier-sharp comic touches and almost unbearably ratchets up the tension in the vocal ensembles, where a seed of uncertainty leads to overwhelming confusion.Perhaps the madly slamming window shutters during the storm weren’t supposed to raise a titter, but everything else seems impeccably judged – even the surtitles at one point carry a gag.Be sure to catch this operatic treasure, at Glyndebourne or on tour, before it slips back to base-metal state.

Promised End, on which composer Alexander Goehr collaborated with the late Shakespearian scholar Sir Frank Kermode, is an operatic version of King Lear – not the entire play, but a kind of filleted version, focusing on the plight of Gloucester as well as Lear himself. Whether the drama works, in what seems like a highlights form, is a moot point.Thus far, Shakespeare’s play has failed to achieve a successful operatic setting. Both Verdi and Britten considered it, but neither followed through – German composer Aribert Reimann’s crude and noisy version, from 1978, has deservedly disappeared.For all the goodwill attending the much liked Goehr, now 78, who spent the bulk of his career as professor of music at Cambridge, it is hard to see his opera lasting the course either. His word setting is undistinguished, and the overall result lacks pace, variety and sheer memorability. Even in an impressive musical performance under the talented Ryan Wigglesworth, it feels protracted.ETO has nevertheless made a very presentable show out of the piece. Adam Wiltshire’s designs borrow from the ritualised sparseness of Japanese Noh theatre. James Conway’s production is alert and focused. Considerable achievements are Roderick Earle’s dominating Lear, Nigel Robson’s noble Gloucester and Lina Markeby’s touching double act as Cordelia and the Fool. But however worthy the artistic intentions, they are not enough to keep a lacklustre score afloat.

Now revived by Ashley Dean for Glyndebourne’s touring troupe, it’s on the whole underwhelming.Some of the touches are effective. The theatre plunges dramatically into darkness before those stern opening orchestral chords, and Paul Brown’s versatile revolving cube stage design turns through myriad settings (though it is sometimes dowdily painted). The Commendatore’s statue in the graveyard scene takes the form of a bloody corpse and at the end of Act 1 the philandering Giovanni’s palazzo is torched, with real flames reflecting the strength of anger rising against him. The setting, updated to the fifties, allows Leporello not only to list but also to photograph the thousands of women bedded by his master.At Zerlina’s wedding, though, the costumes mix fifties dresses with suits apparently from Burton’s, while Don Giovanni’s servants wear liveried frockcoats. But the main flaw is that the characters themselves need to be more sharply drawn.Making his UK opera debut, Norwegian baritone Audun Iversen makes for a fairly suave Don Giovanni, though he is just occasionally outsung by Robert Gleadow’s Leporello – the former sometimes needing to work too hard to project. None of the cast stands out, though Natasha Jouhl (Donna Anna) has a clean, powerful instrument which just needs a finessing in the upper reaches. Young Czech conductor Jakub Hrusa, Glyndebourne on Tour’s new Music Director, proves highly capable though not alight with inspiration.

The plot is relatively simple – the tyrant Tiridate lusts after his sister-in-law Zenobia, and invades her husband Radamisto’s kingdom to acquire her, but his intentions are thwarted by the mutual faithfulness of Radamisto and Zenobia. Eventually Tiridate himself is removed from power by his rebellious army, and – slightly optimistically – all the other characters forgive him.Gideon Davey’s sets and costumes evoke the locale of the story – a vaguely defined Asia Minor – at different times in its long history. They liven up as the evening proceeds. Alden’s direction is skilful, but seems less committed than in his finest work.Laurence Cummings conducts with alacrity, and there’s some outstanding singing from Lawrence Zazzo as a generous Radamisto, Christine Rice’s loyal Zenobia, Sophie Bevan as Tiridate’s ultra-submissive wife Polissena, Ryan McKinny’s unstable Tiridate, and Henry Waddington as Radamisto’s father, Farasmane. In the role of Tiridate’s ally Tigrane, who eventually removes him from power, Ailish Tynan is less secure.

Centre stage is a bed – symbol not only of the sexual secrets hinted at in the piece but also of dreams, such as the exotic forest and night sky conjured up by the governess’s fevered imagination. But the result looks cluttered, and not always responsive to the needs of the piece. A sequence where young Flora plays with puppets, however, exerts a disturbing fascination.The central performances go well, and sometimes brilliantly. With her soprano vividly employed, Atherton’s overwrought governess goes right up to the emotional wire. Yvonne Howard’s good-hearted Mrs Grose epitomises the solid background against which strange events stand out sharply. Benjamin Hulett’s Prologue and Quint will develop further, but are already notably well sung. Gisele Allen offers a striking Miss Jessel. The children are excellent, with Fflur Wyn’s hyper-active Flora offsetting James Micklethwaite’s flawlessly sung and immaculately acted Miles.Best of all is Opera North’s orchestra under music director Richard Farnes, which charts Britten’s intricate score with perfect precision and a palpable sense of atmosphere.

The piece is a substantial Italian opera of the period midway between the better known Cavalli and Handel, with shorter arias than the latter. An uneven score, at its best it proves worthwhile.The story tells of the queen of Thebes whose pride leads her to disrespect the gods – a dangerous thing to do in the world of Greek legend. Not surprisingly, her come-uppance, in the final scene, is suitably devastating: her children are all killed, her husband commits suicide and she herself is turned into stone. But the action takes its time getting there, with complex plots based on love or power politics all along the way. A stronger production might help to clarify the journey. As it is, Lukas Hemleb’s facetious rather than funny staging does not succeed in doing so, while designs by Raimund Bauer and Andrea Schmidt-Futterer are of mixed quality.Uneven singing, too. The Polish male soprano Jacek Laszczkowski, singing Niobe’s husband Anfione, is small-scale and distinctly uneven. Veronique Gens remains cold and unsympathetic as the wilful Niobe. Iestyn Davies provides one of the evening’s best performances as Creonte, who eventually succeeds to the Theban throne. Conductor Thomas Hengelbrock brings his own Balthasar Neumann Ensemble to the Covent Garden pit, though despite their best endeavours the end product is a long and patchy evening.

As with so many of her assumptions, the fine soprano searches out the character’s darkest corners and presents them with a personal commitment that is both brave and incisive.The plight of Janacek’s extraordinary creation – doomed to live for centuries, but eventually desperate to free herself from her meaningless existence – is commandingly revealed.But the show is far more than just a personal triumph for Roocroft. Around her, ENO assembles an excellent cast, all of whom seek out the inherent lyricism of Janacek’s notes as well as defining their characters with precision. Outstanding are Andrew Shore’s fussy lawyer, Kolenaty, Ashley Holland’s bullish Baron Prus, Alasdair Elliott’s faddish Vitek, and Peter Hoare’s impulsive Albert Gregor.Veteran Ryland Davies makes something lively and touching out of mad old Hauk-Sendorf, who encounters Emilia again after a gap of 50 years and is besotted by her a second time.The designs by Charles Edwards and Sue Willmington present a spare but handsome twenties locale for the strange events to take place in.

Fabled artistic director of San Diego’s La Jolla Playhouse, latterly in charge of Ontario’s Stratford Shakespeare Festival, Des McAnuff has only one previous opera production on his CV, Berg’s Wozzeck, a 2007 show reportedly dominated by the noise as well as the visual impact of Robert Brill revolving set.Squaring up to Gounod’s operatic warhorse, McAnuff’s inclination to sacrifice 19th-century trappings sits uneasily with the renewed 21st-century requirement for big-scale spectacle: this, like Anthony Minghella’s ENO Butterfly, is a co-production destined for the Met. Whichever edition is used Faust takes the form of a series of tableaux; the narrative is fragmented yet we need to believe in the interaction of its protagonists. How to square the circle?  At Covent Garden David McVicar ditched the original German setting for a Parisian parable of the composer’s own life. McAnuff, going for a more radical displacement, has Faust and Mephistopheles invade the milieu of John Adams’s Robert Oppenheimer opera, Doctor Atomic, doing little with the conceit other than exploiting its visual possibilities.Brill’s ever-present metallic shell, with spiral staircases, gantries and, at the rear, a large blank panel lending itself to video projection, anchors the action in what appears to be a nuclear research facility, a reminder that science has brought Faust – and ourselves – to the edge of total annihilation. But when the shambling post-Hiroshima Faust of 1945 is propelled back to his youth courtesy of his Mephistophelian Big Daddy, we find ourselves in the First World War era, another period of mechanised mass destruction, and the production loses focus. Lord Harewood would have disapproved: “the attempts of modern producers to suggest in general the horrors of war and in particular wounded men returning from the front involves so great a solecism as to be doomed to failure.”Could it be that the action plays out in the laboratory of Faust’s mind? Might Mephistopheles’s demons suggest the charred victims of atomic Armageddon? Outwardly things turn oddly conventional. Predictable props include a large cross lowered to suggest a church. Kelly Divine’s choreography is Broadway slick; Paul Tazewell’s costumes are in period. Only the lighting and video designs of Peter Mumford and Dustin O’Neill have the wow factor. There is a visual coup of sorts in Act 5 when, rather than mounting a scaffold, Marguerite ascends to heaven up the back stairs, an angelic chorus having pronounced her saved after all. Faust is returned to 1945 for a brief nuclear flash and the evening ends.Edward Gardner obtains coolly competent work from the orchestra, even if rhythms could be lifted more. The choral response is patchier. Faust is personable and slightly wooden as portrayed by Toby Spence in a variant of his Tom Rakewell persona. The voice, recognizably that of an English tenor, is projected with conviction and force. The unlikely agent of his destruction is Iain Paterson’s suave Devil majoring on elegant phrasing and good diction. There is little menace: the role lies rather low for him. And why the ponytail? Melody Moore is an efficient lyric soprano whose Marguerite lacks charm. Shining in smaller roles, Anna Grevelius’s Siebel is notably well sung and Pamela Helen Stephen is affecting as Marthe.

While he enjoys a substantial following, many listeners find the sheer repetition of his scores simplistic rather than simple.In this work premiered in Seattle in 2000 and based on a short story by Franz Kafka, an unnamed Visitor to some far-flung colony finds himself the witness to a judicial execution which involves the use of a complex machine that inscribes the victim’s back as it kills him.Becoming increasingly aware of the ghastly barbarity of the execution, whose virtues are explained to him with loving devotion by the Officer in charge, the Visitor distances himself morally from the act without actually trying to prevent it. It is the Officer himself who submits to the machine’s final killing.What might work as a literary artefact is harder to present dramatically, and Glass’s stop-go, static score is little help. What does succeed is Michael McCarthy’s economical staging, designed by Simon Banham, which climaxes in a riveting recreation of the execution.Omar Ebrahim excels as the Officer, with Gerald Tyler moving in the silent role of the Condemned Man. Michael Bennett needs more heft to strike home as the Visitor.

Unlike Boheme (and many other Miller productions), Don Pasquale is not updated, in this case, from its mid-19th-century setting (except that Norina’s spending spree after duping Don Pasquale into marrying her is evidenced by boxes from Versace, Prada, Escada and La Perla).Isabella Bywater’s three-storey-high doll’s house set is a triumph, not only for its loving detail but also in enabling several strands of action to play out simultaneously. Hence, at the opera’s beginning, Ernesto and his lover Norina are engaged in a tryst while Pasquale below is plotting to disinherit Ernesto, plus there’s the usual ‘below stairs’ activities of servants in the kitchen.English tenor Barry Banks rises well to the challenge of stepping into a role taken in 2004 by Juan Diego Florez, and while he lacks the Peruvian sensation’s seamless fluency, the voice has a distinctive ringing quality, as well as a winning lyrical quality in his Cerchero lontana terra.Paolo Gavanelli as the duped elderly Don Pasquale throws great energy into his comic role, and Jacques Imbrailo brings vocal authority to the scheming Doctor Malatesta. But it is Costa Rican soprano Iride Martinez who is especially striking, as the flirtatious, self-assured Norina, navigating with ease the coloratura writing.Evelino Pido, replacing the late Sir Charles Mackerras, not only serves the drama as well as the comedy, but brings life to the accompanying figures that in many other hands can sound lumpen.

Vast audiences will have caught this wonderful show.Miller’s largely self-designed and locally resourced modern-dress staging, replete with mobile phones and laptops, is inexpensive to mount but still looks clean, elegant and genuinely cool. It must be one of the best investments the company has ever made. Witty, profound and apparently endlessly revivable, it never fails, and certainly doesn’t on this occasion.The largely young cast forms a perfect ensemble, skilled and detailed in their acting and brilliant in some sure-fire comic routines. Vocally, Maria Bengtsson’s Fiordiligi tires a little but otherwise shows consistent intelligence and purpose. She’s perfectly partnered by Jurgita Adamonyte as her flightier sister, Dorabella.Like Bengtsson, Pavol Breslik’s Ferrando sounds a little worn in Act II but he’s generally persuasive and stylish. So too, is Stephane Degout’s macho-man Guglielmo, firmly and vividly in character. Thomas Allen, who turned 66 on the first night of the run, remains a masterly, conscienceless Alfonso, manipulating everyone in sight. Vocally and dramatically, Rebecca Evans is a Despina of the highest possible class.Making an extremely auspicious debut with the company is German conductor Thomas Hengelbrock. His highly individual interpretative touches convince, and the orchestra plays sensationally well for him.

During its 15-minute span, the piece affectingly charts the woman’s mental uncoiling. Neatly diffused electroacoustic effects almost graphically present the voices in her head and the hands of a jittery video clock jump randomly to suggest a temporal limbo.Heldt’s whispering and nervous repetition of phrase fragments make for involving drama and her undoing proper comes over a suitably gothic crashing piano cadenza. Saleeb uses his ensemble of six players to skilful effect.Next came only the second London performance of Steve Reich’s Three Tales (2002), a collaboration with his wife, video artist Beryl Korot. The 70-minute video opera is a commentary of the 20th century via three technological milestones – the crash of the Hindenburg airship in 1937, atomic bomb testing at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific during the forties and fifties and, most recently, genetic cloning as represented by Dolly the sheep.Though the work makes use of documentary footage and eyewitness accounts, plus interviews with contributors including Marvin Minsky and Richard Dawkins, there are longueurs in the last two acts. But under the musical direction of Nick Sutcliffe, the young Ensemble BPM, joined by the Ligeti Quartet, put in a concentrated and vivid performance. A bold and impressive achievement indeed for a group formed only last year.

The show itself is sponsored by Lloyds TSB. So what does this have to do with a review of an operatic version of Porgy and Bess? Well, the price of the £50 seat that I was occupying, that’s what. If I’d actually had to pay for it, what would I have been getting?Not a lot, to be honest. To be sure the vast CinemaScope-style screen that dominates the top half of the stage is impressive most of the time it is used, mixing monochrome live action play with RGB arty video collages, but that still leaves a whole lot more to take into account.Directors Jose Montalvo and Dominique Hervieu’s vision is breathtakingly and almost intentionally hit and miss, throwing in impressive huge set-pieces in the hope that we won’t notice the lazily recycled concepts linking them. The words emperor, new and clothes spring to mind but, sadly for the theatre industry and paying audiences, their gamble that people accept this will pay off. The choreography is half-baked, the orchestration pedestrian and the civil rights movement connection insulting. Montalvo and Hervieu have assembled a line-up of singers who, although clearly talented, are abysmally miscast and struggle to project and enunciate, which may be fine for plodding your way through Britten but is the kiss of death for Gershwin. There are exceptions – notably the older and presumably more experienced performers – but they clearly cannot carry the show, and the story sinks in this ocean of errors.One should be wary about tackling Porgy and Bess as an opera for the simple reason that it is a musical already conceived of as opera.Glitzy window-dressing to distract the eye and a screen as cheap (yet ultimately expensive) compensation for real-action development in Catfish Row do not make a Big Idea. Talent and a simple understanding of one’s subject do. Plus respect for one’s audience. Standing outside at the interval, a large family group of three generations with two teenagers emerged clutching their programmes, announcing they were off home and disappeared down the road. For the loss of those two kids alone, all one can say is shame, shame, utter shame on the showmakers.

He is strangely unperturbed by his general Pilpatoe’s reports of a band of foreigners who are marching on the capital. Unease deepens when the Spanish captain Navres turns up, flinging a Coca-Cola bottle dismissively into the court as a harbinger of the devastation that is to come. Sure enough, when Cortes does materialise, we can but watch as Montezuma approaches his doom with Christ-like resignation – a decision that damns his subjects too.The damage done, everything is thrown up into the air for Act III where the resonance with present-day Mexico is manifest. The orchestra joins the cast onstage – the conductor pushes Cortes aside – in a circle around Montezuma who stands again Christ-like atop a huge column draped in a huge Mexican flag, Eupaforice Mary Magdalene-like at his feet, the irony complete since they have refused to become Christian. The Mexicans now are dressed for carnival, each brandishing a Coke. But, though corrupted en masse, they know the long road to independence has already started and Montezuma’s demise is no celebration for Cortes, lost in the crowd of the missionary-led chorus closer.Sung in Italian with surtitles, Montezuma confidently meets the challenge of dramatic contrast posed by the lengthy arias distributed equally among the protagonists, whose high parts are written mostly for castrati (today’s counter-tenors) and sopranos. Athletic Flavio Oliver cuts a sympathetic figure, although a little uncertain in the lower register, while Adrian-George Popescu is a powerfully restrained Cortes along with Christophe Carre’s sinister yet comic Spanish captain Navres. Lourdes Ambriz sings Eupaforice, a deeply complex character, with an enviable range of emotions and almost steals the show with her extraordinary aria sung while being shoved down the steps of a pyramid by her fellow Mexicans. The Concerto Elyma under Gabriel Garrido’s deft hand and Herman Sorgeloos’ monolithic Aztec pyramid flow with director Claudio Valdes Kuri’s remarkably focused movement.If we’re talking colonialism, corruption and even globalisation, Montezuma pushes all the right buttons, while there is a singular joy in experiencing an opera that is musically and visually accessible to wider audiences, entertaining as it is intellectual. In a show that finds room for very human humour in such tragedy, the sight of Navres’ dog happily wagging its tail over the first violin is worth the ticket price alone.

A week into the festival comes Intolerance, a collaboration between Northern Irish musical dramatist Conor Mitchell and playwright Mark Ravenhill (of Shopping & Fucking fame, in his first operatic project). Taking its title and text from one of the Shoot/Get Treasure/Repeat plays, the monologue features soprano Rebecca Caine as the housewife Helen who suffers from a mysterious gut problem. Yoga practice, probiotic yogurt ingestion and avoiding caffeine seem to offer some relief (all of which point to a self-absorbed, middle-class existence), but there is a hidden intolerance demonstrated by her anti-Semitic outbursts. The episodic nature of the text makes for a satisfying musical-dramatic framework, and Mitchell handles his six-piece ensemble with evident craft – though in performance, they occasionally drown out Caine’s highly intelligent yet natural performance. Her voice draws lyricism out of sometimes anti-lyrical (but always appealing) lines, and is rich in tonal shading.In Jordan Hunt and JohnJoseph Bibby’s straightforwardly comic Golden Years, aging soprano Lavinia Greengarden – effectively Hyacinth Bouquet cast as a parochial opera starlet – has a violent intolerance of pre-show bonbons, causing her apparently to pop her clogs just before a crucial performance for the local light opera society in the presence of the local arts-funding tsarina. At the last minute, Lavinia’s faithful friend Toots Mulholland is thrust into the limelight, later joined in a triumphant duo as Lavinia recovers. Jordan Hunt sets the quick-fire text with skill, taking Britten as his benchmark. While in some ways unambitious, the piece is well executed and genuinely, if lightly, entertaining.

It shocked Moscow’s traditional public when premiered in 2006 – the great soprano Galina Vishnevskaya, a legendary Tatiana, was outraged. Yet it is a hugely perceptive piece of work in which the presentation of characters and situations, if regularly extreme, possesses a truthfulness that grips the attention throughout. Rarely does a director show an ability to draw such searching, immaculately realised performances from a cast as here. They respond with utter commitment.There are some controversial departures from the text. Alexei Dolgov’s Lensky takes over Monsieur Triquet’s innocent little song in a performance suggesting an individual increasingly out of control. The duel between Lensky and Onegin is presented as a clumsy struggle over a rifle with a fatal conclusion. But the central performances – Tatiana Monogarova’s pathologically withdrawn Tatiana, Mariusz Kwiecien’s awkward Onegin, Anatoli Kotscherga’s paternal Gremin – are all outstanding, while the perfected detail of the smaller roles and broader background are mesmerising, with Gleb Filshtinsky’s interventionist lighting adding immeasurably to the unsettling effect.

The show needs a little tightening but its spirit is well captured here in John Warrack’s translation, though not enough of the words come across.The Britten is stronger, defining the familiar narrative with music of real atmosphere and imagination. Mark Chaundy impresses as the devil-like Tempter, with a persuasive performance from Daniel Joy as the Younger Son and James Harrison sketching in the Elder Son effectively. Trevor Alexander makes a strong Father in the Britten and shines brightly as the equivalent figure in the Mendelssohn.Both shows are cleanly staged by Joe Austin in economical designs by Simon Kenny. Elizabeth Burgess’s conducting needs more initiative in places, but she generally manages her fine players efficiently.

The production was first seen in 1975 and has returned to Glyndebourne numerous times, as well as being reproduced by other companies the world over. Judging from the ovation the creative team received at their curtain call, the audience is delighted to see it again.And so they should be. Hockney’s inventively coloured and textured designs are distinctively unified and provide a memorable frame for Cox’s skilful presentation of the narrative. 35 years old at this revival, this is not just Glyndebourne’s most durable staging, but one of its most outstanding. Its only problem is the unduly protracted pauses between scenes, which induce a loss of momentum.The cast is strong though not immaculate. Charmingly personified as the young lovers are by Topi Lehtipuu’s Tom and Miah Persson’s Anne Trulove, neither is quite big enough vocally to seize the attention. Matthew Rose’s more solid Nick Shadow is a winner, and Clive Bayley does sterling work as Anne’s respectable father. Elena Manistina’s Baba the Turk and Graham Clark’s Sellem are both excellent.Conductor Vladimir Jurowski draws fine playing from the London Philharmonic in his detailed account of the score, yet while the chorus are marvellous in their acting, some of their singing is rhythmically imprecise in a piece that demands consistent pinpoint accuracy.

Now the Soho Theatre has taken the production (its first opera) under its wing, and the intimacy and edge are still there.This is partly thanks to director Robin Norton-Hale’s updated setting to a shabby but lovable Soho student flat. It is also due to some small but judicious cuts.In modern-day Soho, Mimi is a migrant worker from Ukraine, a cleaner who sends her wages back home, and the four creatives – Rodolfo, Schaunard, Colline and Marcello – are poor but middle-class. As became the hallmark of the Kilburn production, for Act II’s Cafe Momus scene, the audience decamps to the bar downstairs, making for a genuinely unusual, if chaotic, operatic setting.Music Director Andrew Charity’s solo piano replaces the orchestra – a small feat of stamina and finger dexterity. But there’s an occasional lack of fire in the playing, and little connection with the cast.With eight performances a week, the biggest roles are quadruple cast. On press night, Rosalind Coad’s Mimi was the performance that thrilled in purely vocal terms – unfolding an already rich vista of expression in her upper range. Anthony Flaum (Rodolfo) proved a natural singer-actor, his myriad facial expressions counting for much in this small venue. Norton-Hale manages to produce some real theatre, not least in the poignant Act III scene in which Mimi and Rodolfo determine (again) to part, but then put the break-up on ice. Musically there may be some shortcomings, but as a piece of musical theatre, this is an intelligent, cohesive and satisfying show.

Marking the high point in the career of a composer a generation younger than Puccini, it subsequently disappeared from the repertoire. All credit, then, to Holland Park, for offering a major revival as part of their imaginative policy of turning the spotlight on Puccini’s neglected contemporaries.Based on the famous love story sketched in Dante and dramatised by Gabriele D’Annunzio, Francesca sounds nothing like Puccini. Its influences are Wagner, Debussy and Strauss, brought together in a blend of impressionism, modernism and even expressionism. It’s a heady mix, conveyed in some extraordinarily vivid choral and (particularly) orchestral writing, as well as harmony that combines subtlety with punch. Conductor Phillip Thomas and the company’s resident chorus and orchestra do it proud.Less immediately memorable, perhaps, is the vocal writing, though the piece certainly intrigues enough to make one want to experience it again. Here the individual performances carry ample conviction and authority, with Cheryl Barker physically alluring in the title role and Julian Gavin earning maximum respect as he takes on the huge challenge of her lover, Paolo. Equally impressive are Jeffrey Black’s nasty Gianciotto and Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts’s even nastier Malatestino. Not every moment works in Martin Lloyd-Evans’s staging, which include starkly effective designs by Jamie Vartan. But enough of it is effective, to make this an evening of real intensity, not to be missed by Italian opera fans.

He achieves this partly by keeping the staging simple throughout.There’s no set to speak of, and very few props (if you discount the 40 or so chairs that are nearly always on stage. This chair fixation reaches new heights, literally, in Act 3, when a number are strikingly, but inexplicably, suspended at various angles from red ropes).Second night, Act 1 – the least rambling of the four – was a surprising slow-burner, with Gweneth-Ann Jeffers’ Leonora dramatically unconvincing in her confusion about whether to elope with Don Alvaro.But her Act 2 arioso upon her arrival at the monastery – and her touching subsequent duet with the Padre (a rich-toned Mikhail Svetlov) was affecting.If Jeffers continued to improve over the evening, so did Peter Auty, who not only acquired greater vocal heroism, but brought a mastery of tonal colour in his war-wounded duet with Alvaro.If Aled Hall’s assured pedlar Trabuco steals the comic thunder from Donald Maxwell’s Friar Melitone, he’s matched by Carole Wilson’s war-mongering gypsy Preziosilla, who gives an unnervingly natural performance. Mark Stone’s Don Carlo is another highlight, combining richness with dramatic heft.In the pit, conductor Stuart Stratford’s obvious enthusiasm for the score results in a reading that displays affection and ardour in equal measure.

However brilliant the designs by Barbara de Limburg Stirum, without a more focused critique of consumer capitalism, the show’s visual coups make little sense. The enchanted forest of Act II is rendered as a clearing of defoliated trees hung about with plastic bags, a conceit rescued by the bold lighting of Joel Adam. The costumes are Pelly’s own.If conceptual problems remain, revival director Stephane Marlot has a line-up of singing actors at least as capable as that originally assembled in 2008. The new Hansel is mezzo Alice Coote, whose exhaustingly boyish stage business and distinctive vocal timbre (she sounds something like a hollowed-out Janet Baker) is well-suited to a role she has sung with equal success at the Met. Gretel is reallocated to the fresh-voiced German soprano Lydia Teuscher, making a memorable, even touching UK opera debut. Wolfgang Ablinger-Sperrhacke reprises his hardworking drag-act Witch, quite a sight with his shocking pink attire and removable wig, less impressive vocally. Another returnee, Irmgard Vilsmaier offers a Mother on a Wagnerian scale – you won’t hear this role more compellingly sung.It is a tight show, but it falls to the London Philharmonic and conductor Robin Ticciati, already an old Hansel and Gretel hand, to contribute the requisite fairy-tale tenderness and warmth.

Happily, no hitches interfered with this revival. Under the work’s original conductor, Franck Ollu, and with the luxury of the London Sinfonietta at the back of the stage, the score once more impressed as a clever and effective piece of work that counterpoints Martin Crimp’s libretto – a resonant reworking of the Pied Piper of Hamelin theme – neatly and skilfully.Susan Bickley and Claire Booth share all the roles in the piece, encompassing the Minister, his Wife, their Child and the Crowd, as well as the elusive and wronged Stranger (alias the Pied Piper) himself, who takes his traditional and terrible revenge for the Minister’s cynical deceit.In John Fulljames’s clear and spare production, and with Soutra Gilmour’s equally laconic but memorable designs, this impressive revival makes one look forward to Benjamin’s second and larger opera, apparently already underway.Fulljames and Gilmour also collaborate on Luciano Berio’s Recital 1, once again staged with flair. Bickley has her work cut out singing the main role, written for Berio’s first wife, the extraordinary Cathy Berberian. The piece is literally a thing of shreds and patches, made up of fragments from umpteen repertory pieces, joined together with a self-indulgent text. Unfortunately the result has dated badly, and now seems little more than an upmarket cabaret act.

At the back we see not only the snow falling outside but disordered yet evocative images (designed by Ian William Galloway) from Mr D’s memory bank.Other characters come and go – Elizabeth Sikora’s moving Mrs D, trying to deal with her husband’s condition, Benedict Nelson as the Clinician-Scientist who treats him, Rachel Hynes as the Caregiver, who brings her daughter to the home because she’s unable to afford a babysitter, and Fflur Wyn as the teenager herself, bored and mildly resentful.Maxwell’s overly poetic libretto is more occluded than it need be. Although it is expertly presented by the cast, the piece remains fuzzy round every possible edge. Langer’s score, skilfully performed under conductor Nicholas Collon, is a patchwork of slender ideas, very few of which make any appreciable mark.

Messages lie strewn on tables, a book is left open at a certain page, individuals in period costume flash past you on their way to an uncertain fate.The effect is deliberately disorienting, and part of the evening’s fascination lies in trying to fit it all together, not quite succeeding becomes part of a mysterious and resonant journey. There are mid-scale and big set pieces, too, including a finale whose ultimate visual statement is shattering.Rasch, best known for his song-cycle Mein Herz Brennt, based on the work of the German industrial metal band Rammstein, supplies a wide-ranging and highly atmospheric score that uses spare modernist gestures as well as some recycled late-Romanticism. It’s an integral part of a show that employs familiar operatic devices to underscore a vivid and regularly unnerving experience.

Aided by Francis O’Connor’s starkly effective sets, Verdi’s commentary on love destroyed by the machinations of the powerful, derived from Schiller’s classic play Kabale und Liebe, emerges as a masterpiece.The two fathers battling away in the interests of their respective children – one a peasant girl, the other a flaky young nobleman – are David Kempster as the old soldier Miller and Balint Szabo as his local lord, Count Walter. Both are superb from a vocal and dramatic viewpoint, their respective mind-sets wonderfully revealed. The two doomed young lovers – Susannah Glanville’s anxious Luisa and John Bellemer’s barely controlled Rodolfo – are finely realised, though each needs a touch of firming up at the top of their voices. Miroslava Yordanova makes a great deal more than usual out of the role of the Duchess Federica, keen to marry Carlo but uncertain of his real feelings. Andrew Slater plays Wurm, the chief villain, to the hilt, without ever going over the top – how nice to see him in a part he can sink his teeth into.Conductor Andrew Greenwood leads an excellent musical performance, setting the seal on this thrilling evening.

To modern ears, the most obvious influence is Berlioz.Like Rossini’s Figaro, Cornelius’s barber is the Mr Fixit of his city, whose oriental ambience and sensuousness are fitfully conjured up in Cornelius’s patchy score.Stephen Barlow conducts, though even with more pep than he supplies, the work’s weakness – a lack of genuinely strong ideas – would show through.Alessandro Talevi’s production starts irrelevantly, with Cornelius and Liszt appearing during the overture in a sequence that would leave anyone not familiar with the background lost.The first act, played against an attractive eastern backcloth in Madeleine Boyd’s designs, is weak, with jokes that look on the desperate side.A Heath Robinson tricycle for the Barber’s entrance has to stand in for the performance of real personality and humanity that Jonathan Lemalu does not provide.Michael Bracegirdle’s Nureddin is insufficiently pleasing on the ear for the romantic lead.After the interval things improve, with Boyd’s set a strikingly beautiful interior. The score, too, is more interesting here, but once again the principals fail to realise the potential of their roles.

The set becomes increasingly lopsided and cluttered as the evening goes on.An overall problem is tone. Like many directors, Kent seems to view the piece as containing occasional comic scenes as opposed to being a comedy with some very serious interventions. Here there is rarely a laugh except when there’s a witty surtitle. Opportunities are missed to present Gerald Finley’s Don Giovanni and Luca Pisaroni’s Leporello as a comic double act, although the latter makes a fair attempt to be funny.Finley’s Don is vocally strong but over-earnest – cool and handsome in his shades, he never really seems to be enjoying himself. Nor does Kate Royal’s Donna Elvira, who sounds stressed as well as, more understandably, looking it. Anna Samuil possesses a rich, substantial tone, well deployed in Donna Anna’s arias. William Burden’s Don Ottavio is on the dry side, but the peasant couple of Anna Virovlansky’s Zerlina and Guido Loconsolo’s Masetto are unfailingly perky and bright. With a hard-driven reading of the score from conductor Vladimir Jurowski, there’s genuine musical quality, though an essential thread within the piece has gone missing.

Second time around, and the whole show works vastly better. Conductor Hartmut Haenchen delivers a riveting account of the score, with the ROH orchestra on searing form.And this is a much stronger cast. Angela Denoke’s Salome is fearless in her attack, and while her mature, respectable persona at first seems ill-matched with the ’16-year-old princess with the voice of an Isolde’ that Strauss optimistically hoped for, her portrayal of the central character’s slow but steady descent into the blood-covered psychopath of the final scene is superbly charted.Similarly, Johan Reuter’s John the Baptist looks like a tramp in his spattered old raincoat, but then prophets are not generally known for a taste for haute couture. More importantly, he floods the theatre with his baleful pronouncements, putting the fear of God into anyone who hears him. Gerhard Siegel’s Herod is masterly in its detail and neurotic overview, Irina Mishura’s Herodias flamboyantly and maliciously queenly.The staging (revived by Justin Way) itself also makes more sense. The Dance of the Seven Veils – with Salome and Herod moving from room to room as we explore a relationship whose past is as murky as its present – flows beautifully, while the watchful attendants at Herod’s court add to the shocking intensity of the experience.

Here it returns with a fine cast, enabling Beethoven’s great hymn to freedom to excite and inspire a new audience.Designer Jamie Vartan gives us a modern context. The run-down facility where Florestan and other prisoners are held carries resonances of Guantanamo Bay in the inmates’ orange jumpsuits, while contemporary items such as CCTV and a shredder – the latter hastily employed when Njabulo Madlala’s Minister turns up – show a set-up run with meticulous irregularity. Nicky Spence’s Jaquino is a viciously brutal guard, even physically threatening his girlfriend, Sarah Redgwick’s Marzelline – which contradicts the comic tone with which Beethoven deliberately introduces the drama before the full horror of Florestan’s plight is revealed. The Holland Park stage is brilliantly used, with the prisoners’ appearance from their cells a shattering coup.But it is with the central performances that the show really strikes home. Yvonne Howard’s Fidelio is credible in her male disguise and blazes fiercely in her singing. Tom Randle’s Florestan wrings the heart with his anguished vocalism and flawless acting. Stephen Richardson presents gaoler Rocco’s moving moral goalposts and instinct for self-preservation. Phillip Joll’s Pizarro suffers from a spreading voice, but there’s no denying the fearsome image he presents of a petty tyrant willing to murder his enemy. Peter Robinson conducts a secure account of the score, with the chorus on terrific form. Overall, a wonderful evening.

It’s an astonishing feat for a man who turns 70 in January, and who has had a recent operation for cancer, to sing like a performer half his age, and put one or two other cast members in the shade. As always, Domingo gives his all, here as the corsair turned compassionate father and Doge of Genoa, fulfilling the requirements of Verdi’s portrait of an ideal ruler with his customary dignity and attack.But the show as a whole is more than just a vehicle for a much-loved artist. Although the staging is old-fashioned, and probably was even when new in 1991, it has been decently rehearsed.Marina Poplavskaya sings the role of Amelia, Boccanegra’s long lost daughter, though the heavy repertoire she specialises in has taken its toll of the top of her voice. Ferruccio Furlanetto is solid and secure as Boccanegra’s implacable enemy, Fiesco. Nearly stealing the evening is Joseph Calleja as Gabriele Adorno – Domingo’s former role. Taking on a heavier assignment than he has sung hitherto, Calleja proves himself a match for it and supplies the most exquisite singing of the evening.Antonio Pappano conducts, attending to the many subtleties of the piece as well as to its overall momentum. These may well be Domingo’s last Covent Garden appearances, but with his voice in its current state, that’s not a foregone conclusion.

Designer Yannis Thavoris uses the ancient terrace of Holland Park House and its long, narrow performance space with imagination, wood-panelled lengths evoking interior and exterior settings with wit and aplomb. Other aspects are less consistent. Pistols replace swords, much use is made of unattractive masks and the final scene descends into incomprehensibility when the Commendatore reappears in Giovanni’s costume and forces his suicide. Is some psychological point being made? Earlier, master and servant address their remarks to the statue’s corpse, which makes no sense either.Nicholas Garrett is unexceptional as a Don whose personal magnetism must be taken on trust. His Leporello, Matthew Hargreaves, fares better, cataloguing his master’s exploits on a map of Europe that emerges from an early example of the Filofax. The three principal ladies are all making company debuts. Laura Mitchell is Donna Elvira and it is not only her penchant for hats that marks her out from the jewellery-encrusted Donna Anna of Ana James. Mitchell’s shining soprano and rather rapid vibrato should make an interesting foil for Ana/Anna’s rounded, lyrical tone, but neither is reliably audible. Claire Wild’s Zerlina, no more stylish perhaps, is properly penetrating as well as decently acted.It is a curiously uneven display. Robert Dean’s City of London Sinfonia mixes driven, period-influenced playing with slacker moments. Synchronisation falters – the Masetto of Robert Winslade Anderson is prone to lag behind the beat – and, there being no pit, the singers are frequently overwhelmed, the effect coarse. The opera is sung in Italian with surtitles.The opening night of OHP’s summer season coincided with exceptionally heavy rain. This time it was extreme heat and a high pollen count, which took its toll on performers and audience members alike.

We follow the stream of consciousness of an ordinary woman living in an ordinary flat. Perhaps through boredom, she imagines a genie who grants her three wishes – her first is for nothing – for everything to just go away. Her second wish is to return to her humdrum life, upon which her third is for a breathless succession of pleasures and diversions, the excitement of which in itself seems to drive, or restore, her happiness. With just a single voice (sensitively sung and acted by Melanie Pappenheim) plus live electronics (processing and looping), we hear not only the woman’s self-babbling but also her interaction with her other voices. The dream-like atmosphere of the piece (helped by Caryl Churchill’s libretto) allows for an ambiguous character – either a normal, cheery woman having a down moment, or a complex depressive desperate to escape.Nitin Sawhney’s Entanglement combines five female voices with a six-piece ensemble (including Indian tabla and bansuri flute) and draws on philosophical and mathematical principles to explore simultaneously the outcomes for five women awaiting the results of a pregnancy test. Although giving rise to some powerfully individual vocal styles, including Indian and Japanese, its multilingual text is impenetrable. The highly static staging and a musically repetitive second half also don’t help.Lastly, in both senses, comes Jocelyn Pook’s football-themed Ingerland, a noisy, colourful reflection of fanatical passion for the beautiful game. Its 55-minute series of extended numbers – many based on the most cliched stock dance rhythms (a tango here, a rhumba there) – allude to a West End flop. The most striking contributions are the video and audio interviews with Millwall fans. “I cry, I laugh”, goes one chorus – I know which I wanted to do. Pook crassly debases the fans’ religious fervour with a choral Kyrie Eleison. Lord have mercy indeed on this two-dimensional meeting of opera and football, a lamentable no-score draw.

Not that anyone knows how the story is meant to end. In one original source, Zaide and Gomatz are revealed as brother and sister. Here Michael Symmons Roberts’s po-faced English-language libretto, with additional spoken interludes by Ben Power and director Melly Still, handles the theme of redemptive love with a clunking fist while the production’s awkward blasts of theatrical realism contradict the deft stylisation of the music.Intrusively jangling, Anna Fleischle’s designs ring the changes on a single cage motif, erratically lit by Natasha Chivers.Artistic director Ian Page, whose period band lacks its usual absolute assurance, just about holds everything together but the absence of subtitles points up some poor diction on stage.It is an uncomfortable evening: the promising South African dramatic soprano, Pumeza Matshikiza, seems miscast as the heroine and Mark Le Brocq is too much like Iain Duncan Smith to exude much menace as the jilted camp commandant.Making his UK debut as Gomatz, Australian-born tenor Andrew Goodwin comes across as a mild-mannered, tight-throated Nanki-Poo.

Netrebko rises to this particular challenge with an unbeatable combination of scrupulous acting and immaculate vocalism. In his Covent Garden debut, rising star Italian tenor Vittorio Grigolo wins the audience’s hearts with good looks, ardent singing and an eager demeanour that takes on the full tragic dimension of Chevalier des Grieux’s predicament. Between them they generate enough electricity to light up the West End.Music director Antonio Pappano opens up a lot of cuts, adding to the coherence of the piece, and his fluid, emotionally charged conducting helps steer the show towards the status of a gold-plated triumph for the Royal Opera.

Maybe it was the three generations of witches emerging from their caravans, or Macbeth’s claustrophobic breeze-block castle, or the disconcerting smiley motif, drawn on the cardboard box containing the murdered Banquo’s body parts (echoes of David Fincher’s Seven?), and also looming large on the curtain that rises on glitter balled banquet scene of Act II.If it’s difficult to find coherence in Jones’ conception – in which the banal and the sinister both seem to draw laughs (perhaps that’s the point?) – and if it steals Verdi’s dramatic thunder by shouting about itself, there are some compelling devices. That looming smiley reflects the Macbeths’ blithe remorselessness for having killed King Duncan to secure their own ascendency, while in her sleepwalking scene Lady Macbeth obsessively attempts to cleanse her guilt by placing pair after pair of white gloves in a basement washing machine, before suffocating herself inside a plastic laundry bag. Macbeth’s own impending insanity takes on a disturbing physical component, released through epileptic seizures.Swedish-American soprano Erika Sunnegardh – famously plucked from obscurity in 2006 while understudying Karita Mattila at the New York Met – sings Lady Macbeth with impressive depth and lustre. Returning as Macbeth, Andrzej Dobber doesn’t quite bring off the king’s escalating despair, although Yonghoon Lee, on first night, was warmly applauded for his Act IV Ah, la paterno mano, the only truly affecting dramatic characterisation of the evening, after identifying the wheeled-on bodies of his murdered children.Vasily Petrenko makes an auspicious UK opera debut, extracting lusciously balanced and often searing playing from the London Philharmonic Orchestra.

It glistens on the front cloth and is seen more ominously both through the wide windows of the captive Ilia’s cool-chic apartment, and also framed by strip-lights as Idomeneo, confesses to Arbace that he has unwittingly sacrificed his son to the sea-god Neptune.In the static formal arias Mitchell sometimes crowds the stage with distractions. So we have a profusion of sharp-suited palace attendants, as well as a team of cleaners that needlessly erupts upon the VIP lounge at the ferry port in Act 2.And even if Act 3 apparently opens in a conference room – complete with pastoral video footage reflecting the gentle breezes that Ilia invokes – the film projector shouldn’t require adjustment quite so regularly by a willing minion.More revealingly, the dancing/drinking guests in Act 2 allude to an extended celebration following the Idomeneo’s safe return – throwing into relief the torments of the principal characters.And in this scene comes Electra’s aria, during which she coaxes a passing waiter into servicing her need for a spot of foot-fondling – calling into question her professed love for Idamante.The singers are generally left physically unhampered by the direction, and able to deliver the goods vocally. Sarah Tynan’s Ilia combines vocal sweetness with unrivalled intelligibility of the words, while Paul Nilon’s anguished Idomeneo reaches a thrilling emotional climax in his big Act 2 aria – the highlight of the evening.Robert Murray captures well Idamante’s confusion after being apparently rejected by his father. Just occasionally on first night, ENO music director Edward Gardner struggled to align the orchestra with the singers, slightly marring a performance that otherwise carries dramatic weight and turbulent energy.

Both in terms of the alternate grandeur and intimacy of his singing, as well as in his physical presence and stature, he rightly dominates the show.But the cast as a whole is impressive. Christopher Purves is finely attuned to Beckmesser’s malicious comic villainy. Amanda Roocroft is sensitive and involving as Eva, the young woman whose happiness depends on the Nuremberg singing contest producing the right winner.As her preferred choice, Raymond Very’s Walther is taxed by Wagner’s exceptional vocal demands but is valiant in his attempt. Andrew Tortise is slightly overparted as the apprentice David, Anna Burford memorable as his girlfriend, Magdalene and Brindley Sherratt makes an exemplary Pogner.Richard Jones’ broadly traditional staging – designer Paul Steinberg’s visuals mixing the traditional 16th century apparel of Wagner’s libretto with the 19th century of the work’s creation – is more conventional than one expects from this director, but clear in narrative outline as well as intelligent in detail.WNO’s music director Lothar Koenigs draws sumptuous sounds from the orchestra and expanded chorus, though occasionally there’s a lack of forward drive in his careful conducting.

Jeffrey Lloyd Roberts is the hypochondriac Prince, attended by an army of Freud-lookalike physicians, who is transformed from stay-at-home lethargic to citrus-searching lothario. The jester Truffaldino is Wynne Evans, who – whether parading in a banana suit or lumping a suitcase full of rubber chickens – matches the exuberance of his recent guise as the moustachioed pop-up tenor in the Go Compare TV adverts. Director-designer David Fielding occasionally overuses his video screen, but the device fulfils a range of functions – from amplifying the Prince’s pill-trolley, to providing the sun for the desert scenes, to creating a mirror of the auditorium, before which Truffaldino’s two brilliantly colourful divertissements take place.Vuyani Mlinde and Rebecca Cooper make a perfectly sinister pair of sorcerous rivals as the top-hatted Celio and long-legged, ultra-high-heeled Fata Morgana – their scenes accompanied by strip-light lightning rods carried by the Cranks, as well by as a decent sprinkling of smoke and fire. The Prince and Truffaldino are spirited away in Doctor Who’s Tardis, and after pacifying the Cook (butch bass Francisco Javier Borda, coyly flirtatious in his blonde wig and short white pinny), they wrest the Oranges – actually three huge cartons of orange juice – from the frozen corpses in the Cook’s fridge.

It’s visually witty and intriguing, so deftly staged that the whole complex set of manoeuvres moves without faltering.The quartet of lovers – Anna Stephany’s Hermia, Katherine Manley’s Helena, Andrew Staples’s Lysander and George von Bergen’s Demetrius – are young, good-looking and good-sounding, too.

Yet Grange Park’s new production by Lindsay Posner often seems dramatically muted, in contrast to Gianluca Marciano’s impressive conducting, which – especially as heard in this small theatre – unleashes the full force of Puccini’s Technicolor score.The Acts I and II sets – Rome’s Church of Sant’Andrea della Valle and the scheming Scarpia’s apartment in the Palazzo Farnese – appear almost too dark, adding to a muted feel, and in the former the lovers Cavaradossi and Tosca fail to light things up, seeming almost awkward in their few embraces. Indeed, Tosca – a passionate, jealous opera singer – too often appears ordinary, and, in Act I, dowdily dressed.But the singing is good all round, from Timothy Dawkins’ cavernous Angelotti to Robert Poulton’s searing chief of police, Scarpia. Poulton also presents Scarpia’s calculating, sexually intimidating and remorseless nature to chilling effect. Peter Auty’s ringing Cavaradossi, although occasionally showing just a hint of tiredness, is a fine match for Claire Rutter’s boldly penetrating Tosca. The depth of musical expression in this production may be clear to the ears, but it isn’t always reflected by the drama on stage.

Even with the remnants of a throat infection holding her back, the grand expressivity of Connolly’s singing is outstanding.Less vocally even, Antonia Cifrone offers an insecure, combative Elizabeth. Between them is Bulent Bezduz as Leicester, his youthful good looks and vibrant lyric tenor creating a potent counterweight.David Kempster’s Cecil is a tower of strength, and at this second performance understudy Trevor Bowes stepped in with increasing assurance as Talbot.Conductor Guido Johannes Rumstadt maintains positive momentum throughout this memorably handsome and articulate show.

The original idea was developed by Strauss’ librettist Stefan Zweig, who was then prevented from collaborating with the composer because he was Jewish. Zweig’s presence in the end result is suggested here by identifying him as the prompter, Monsieur Taupe – a fine cameo from Stuart Kale – who has a small yet memorable scene near the opera’s close.By this time, the characters, who started out wearing the 18th-century costumes of the work’s original setting (1775), have moved into forties dress. Susan Gritton’s Countess sings an immaculately beautiful final scene with a vision of a city devastated by bombs rising above her.It’s a thoughtful and considered realisation, strong throughout the central performances, even if the theatrical crew – notably Matthew Best’s articulate theatre director La Roche and Sara Fulgoni’s actress Clairon – could do with a touch more flounce. But there are perfect assumptions of the composer Flamand and the poet Olivier from Andrew Kennedy and Roderick Williams, while conductor Stephen Barlow and the English Chamber Orchestra revel in the intricate beauty of Strauss’ writing.

Since then it has become the most popular of operas, and from the moment Mark Willis energetically whips the admirable City of London Sinfonia into the prelude, it is clear that there is to be little hint of failure in Jonathan Munby’s orthodox but sensitive Holland Park production.The second night’s Carmen, the willowy Hannah Pedley, first appears centre stage in a shower of red petals, leaving it three hours later in a sea of bouquets scattered for her latest lover, the toreador Escamillo. In between, she shows all the gypsy fire and passion necessary to win both the unfortunate Don Jose and her audience, singing and dancing with equal success.The production is not entirely convincing in its opening scene, with the rather wooden male chorus of soldiery struggling to hold back a group of well-scrubbed cigarette girls who seem unlikely to have been rolling anything much between their thighs, but it soon picks up a pace that from then on never falters. Mark Panuccio as Don Jose convinces from the moment he delivers his flower song, and builds his jealousy powerfully until its inevitable deadly explosion.Good support comes from David Stephenson’s gentlemanly toreador, while both Stephanie Bodsworth and Alexandra Tiffin deliver sexy cameos as Carmen’s gypsy companions. Julia Sporsen makes the most of her brief appearances as the spurned Micaela.Designer Emma Wee has supplied some unnecessary plywood screens to prop up the first two acts, but sensibly leaves it to her fine costumes to do the visual work in the second half.

It also requires a small army of women in long white dresses to move the structures around.In addition to enacting the mysterious interventions of Debussy’s resonant silent figures, they are given extra movements that distract from the drama’s essential events.Despite Pelleas’s reputation for being pallid and recherche, and for all the enigmas that surround Melisande herself and her relationships with her husband and his half-brother, the opera’s characters and emotions should engage us directly.Here, Anne Sophie Duprels’ doll-like Melisande and Palle Knudsen’s dandified Pelleas do not suggest the ambiguity of the attraction between them.Casting a tenor as Pelleas would have provided greater contrast between the two male leads. Both voices are a standard option in the role.A tower of strength, nevertheless, is Alan Opie’s Golaud, his inner uncertainty perfectly charted as it rises to the violence of incomprehension.Anne Mason’s Genevieve is also beautifully realised, while under conductor Brad Cohen the orchestra brings out all the subtlety and refinement of the marvellous score.

Portraits of Count Almaviva’s distinguished antecedents loom from the walls of his castle, as if frowning upon his desire for extramarital bliss. Taking full advantage of the terrace stage’s situation, when Cherubino (Anna Grevelius) jumps from the Countess’ window, he actually lands in the adjacent parterre garden – for once, visibly in view of the gardener Antonio. And just as dusk settles over the stage, the Act IV sets turn to reveal the foliage of the garden scene, magically blending the stage into its crepuscular surroundings.This would count for less if Cox’s direction were less assured. The web of secret desires, deceits and mockery is cleanly spun. The comic tension in the scene where Cherubino and then the Count are forced to hide (unknown to each other) as Susanna (Sophie Bevan) receives her unexpected visitors is a model of ratcheting comic tension. And, while sending Cherubino off to his military commission, Figaro shaves him, picking up on his former self in Beaumarchais’ The Barber of Seville.Kishani Jayansinghe needs a smoother vocal line to give expression to the role of the abandoned Countess, but James Oldfield is a confident Figaro and Grant Doyle is a rich-toned Count, while Jean Rigby and Conal Coad bring a whiff of (classy) pantomime to the roles of Marcellina and Dr Bartolo.To round things off, Douglas Boyd extracts beguiling balances and stark colouring from the Garsington Opera Orchestra. This is a production as thoroughly distinguished, yet engaging, as you could expect to enjoy.

It’s hardly essential – the opera does not touch on the work of the pearl fishers – but visually it is more impressive, unfortunately, than what succeeds it. Bird’s first set is a stagey recreation of the densely-packed village where the priestess Leila (Hanan Alattar) comes to bless the villagers and their trade, but it hampers movement and the chorus is stuck in serried ranks. Even less striking is the scene in Zurga’s tent where Leila pleads for the life of her lover, Nadir. Woolcock seems unable to get her singers to connect meaningfully with one another. The solo arias, too, are ineffectively presented.But they’re often well sung. Alattar’s spicy soprano suits the French repertoire and she looks the part. Alfie Boe has some graceful and exciting moments as Nadir. Quinn Kelsey’s impressive baritone focuses attention on Zurga, while conductor Rory Macdonald delivers an alert account of the score.

Figaro has rarely seemed so realistically intricate.The cast has many strengths, led by the suavely intelligent Figaro of Erwin Schrott. In magnificent voice, he’s a little free with the notes, but entirely credible as a valet challenging his master and boldly fighting his corner. Eri Nakamura’s Susanna sounds brittle at times, but she enters into the vitality of the staging with aplomb.At the top of the ladder, Marius Kwiecien’s arrogant Count is a tour-de-force, as strong in tone and definition as his vividly willful character.Annette Dasch’s Countess is less vocally even, with some moments of blowsy tone and dodgy pitching blemishing a generally assured and sentient performance.Jurgita Adamonyte’s Cherubino is perceptively sung and gracefully acted, and all the smaller roles are impressive.Best of all is Colin Davis’ luminous conducting, immaculately balanced, and maintaining a flawless momentum without ever rushing Mozart’s notes.

And, but for the radiant azure-blue sky and the floral offerings of the disguised soldiers Ferrando and Guglielmo, there’s little bold colouring on stage.The maid Despina derives laughs more from a surly edge to her demeanour than by any fun-loving extroversion. When the soldiers return in Albanian guise, their coats are darkly austere, rather than vibrantly attractive.All this, we assume, is designed to throw the light back on to human emotions: the sisters’ battle between head and heart, the soldiers’ willingness to test their fiancees, and their petty rivalry each to woo the other’s girl.Sir Charles Mackerras, in the pit with the period-instrument Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, readily underlines this intention – as we hear in the sublime lyricism of the soldiers’ duet Secondate, aurette amiche.The cast is first-rate. Allan Clayton’s ringing tenor (Ferrando) is amply matched by Robert Gleadow’s rich yet agile Guglielmo. Barbara Senator’s bright Dorabella is a foil for the extended dramatic richness of Sally Matthews, in stunning form. Pietro Spagnoli as Don Alfonso, chief architect of the social experiment, oozes quiet charisma.And yet it wouldn’t have hurt to have a few more laughs. Indeed the poignant moments of Cosi can prove more heartrending when cast against buffoonery elsewhere. The lessons may be fully learnt in this School for Lovers, but you can’t help feel they’re somewhat soberly taught.

Transferring David Freeman’s in-the-round Carmen from the Royal Albert Hall to the O2 Arena means opera really can reach the masses.Another popular touch sees Darius Campbell – recent Popstar to Operastar winner – in the role of the toreador Escamillo, for one-performance only.But, unsurprisingly, the production is defined by the spectacle. Twelve dancers (four of them with flames) set the scene for Act 4’s lavish pre-bullfight procession – a festival of acrobats, stilt-walkers, more flame dancers and juggling unicyclists.David Roger’s twisting serpentine stage dominates the arena, symbolising the temptress Carmen, but Cristina Nassif in the title-role fails to loom as large. This is mostly not her fault. With a stage of this scale and 360-degree aspect, it’s difficult for any individual to make a visual impression.Perhaps this was why tens of people around me left before the interval. Or perhaps it was because the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra – miked, then mangled and spat out of a woefully inadequate speaker system – would have sounded less canned on a kitchen radio. A real misjudgement by the producers and an insult to the musicians.John Hudson as the obsessed Don Jose matches Nassif’s capable Carmen (though his dialogue is often wooden), but Elizabeth Atherton is alone in coaxing her microphone into conveying something of the range of her vocal colour, not least in her Act 3 aria – in which, in a quiet coup de theatre, she is alone on the vast, semi-lit stage.If opera is even remotely about the music, then this isn’t a fine ambassador. For vocal and orchestral impact, ENO’s current Tosca would be a much safer bet.

Christopher Oram’s designs, making finely judged use of the stage of Sussex opera house, are outstanding, presenting the tension and claustrophobia aboard HMS Indomitable during the French Wars of 1797 with vivid authority. The action strikes forward into the auditorium to tremendous effect. With conductor Mark Elder leading the musical performance with an immaculate sense of balance and flow, all the words of E M Forster and Eric Crozier’s libretto comes across, and the immense power and subtlety of Britten’s score are wonderfully realised.Under Grandage’s scrupulously observed direction, the characters and their interaction resonate and engage throughout a piece where a metaphysical sense of conflict between good and evil has a palpable presence amongst its political and sexual themes. A masterpiece of emotional ambiguity, Billy Budd here seizes the audience and grips throughout.The central performances are all remarkable. Jacques Imbrailo makes an important career step with his assumption of Billy. In imposing voice, he has the difficult task of presenting a character of natural goodness and entirely succeeds. As his eventual victim and nemesis, John Claggart, Phillip Ens emanates both evil and an almost terrifying sense of inner suffering. Not quite in his best voice on the first night, John Mark Ainsley nevertheless identifies the tight-buttoned rectitude of Captain Vere, inescapably caught between the two. The smaller roles are superbly done and the chorus magnificent. An exceptional evening.

Lighting in this scene is also poorly managed. Overall, and despite some strong moments, the show is not a visual success.Where it scores highly is in the central performances, especially from a vocal point of view, and in music director Edward Gardner’s detailed and magnificently confident reading of Puccini’s score. The orchestra is on virtuoso form and the result is consistently gripping.Rising South African soprano Amanda Echalaz takes on the title role, in which she has already shone at Holland Park and at Covent Garden. Her rich and finely-balanced voice is up to every one of Tosca’s demands, and she shapes the line beautifully – less strong is her diction, and she needs tauter direction to bring her interpretation to its full potential.Julian Gavin’s Cavaradossi is not dramatically charismatic but his voice is on superb for – he seizes on the score’s peak moments to sensational effect. Anthony Michaels-Moore’s Scarpia needs a firmer lower register, and the crucial confrontation with Tosca never quite reaches boiling point. It’s a mixed evening, but the best is remarkable.

The contrast between the military world of the regiment where Marie has grown up and the polite society of her affluent ‘aunt’ is clearly signposted. True love wins out in the end with the added bonus for Marie that she finds out the truth about her family ties.Pelly’s ideas are effective if in no way radical. Dressing the protagonists in attractive, vaguely Edwardian gear, he is content to tell the story with old-fashioned directness and plenty of broad physical comedy. Chantal Thomas’ unlovely designs at least never get in the way – a conceptual tangle of wall charts and laundry for Act I, a sparsely-appointed wood-panelled room for Act II.It is the performances which carry the day. Natalie Dessay and Juan Diego Florez effortlessly reprise their star roles. Indeed they are today synonymous with them, as were Sutherland and Pavarotti for an earlier generation. Ann Murray, new to the lists as the Marquise de Berkenfeld, may be vocally frayed, a less commanding presence than Felicity Palmer last time around, but she is always game. So too is Dawn French in the beefed-up, non-singing role of the Duchesse de Crackentorp.Bruno Campanella’s conducting could be tighter at the outset. Still it’s difficult to imagine an audience feeling shortchanged. Florez’s top Cs are effortlessly placed, the voice sublimely lyrical and unforced, while Alessandro Corbelli is impressive throughout in the supporting role of Sulpice. Vocal pyrotechnics apart, Natalie Dessay’s feisty, hyperactive stage presence belies her age in calendar years. And like Chaplin, she can do pathos as well as comedy.

As expertly authoritative in his singing as he is impressive as an actor, he is by far the most focused and consistent of the three principals.Up until then, Ermonela Jaho’s Violetta has proved able without really stamping her own personality distinctively on the evening. She plays too often to the front to engage with her fellow artists and lacks vocal charisma. But she gains conviction later on, building to a presentable death scene.At her side, her fellow Romanian, tenor Saimir Pirgu, makes a likable Alfredo. His pleasant tone suggests the ingenue, and he’s a decent actor, though there’s more in the part than he currently discovers. Among the smaller roles Changhan Lim’s Marquis stands out for his vitality and Robert Lloyd’s Dr Grenvil for his sheer dignity.But the 1994 staging remains a tepid affair, going through the regular Traviata motions without much in the way of specificity or insight. The parties seem respectably dull for the hectic and hedonistic Parisian demi-monde of the mid-19th century, with the chorus doing its duty unengaged. Yves Abel’s conducting is correct and disciplined, but lacks both the bigger picture and an observation of detail.

Aida demands visual grandeur and up to the interval, Jean-Marc Puissant’s sets and McVicar’s management of sizable stage forces fit the bill entirely. The period is left open – this is an alien culture in thrall to religion and violent ritual, but it’s not the traditional ancient Egypt of the libretto. But it certainly packs a theatrical punch and covers the emotional and intellectual terrain of the piece with easy assurance. Only in the ballets does the tension falter. After the interval, the visuals become more generic, responding less to the work than to the potential of the set.None of the individual performances are sung with much subtlety, but the voices are well chosen and the high voltage required of the principals is regularly achieved. Micaela Carosi’s Aida becomes shrill towards the end, but is potent elsewhere. Dramatically, she never seems very interested in Marcelo Alvarez’s Radames, nor he in her, but his singing is strong and delivered on a heroic level. Marianne Cornetti blasts her way effectively through Amneris and Marco Vratogna is a forceful Amonasro. Distinguished are Giacomo Prestia’s Ramfis and Robert Lloyd’s King, while conductor Nicola Luisotti gives full measure in the score and both orchestra and chorus are magnificent.

Sometimes the movement mirrors the words especially Milton’s “Trip it as you go on the light fantastic toe”. At others, it reflects the music and, in making his own response to the sound, this is also a tribute by Morris to the modern dance movement. Here is a company without a clear hierarchy with enlivening humour and some androgyny between roles. The backcloths, inspired by William Blake’s watercolours, subtly change the mood from scene to scene, as the dancers twirl and leap, somersault and crawl on all fours, climb on each other, prance like horses and form sculptural shapes that gracefully unravel in a seemingly carefree way.A subtle synthesis of design, lighting, poetry, music and dance make this an enriching work of 32 dances full of joy for the 24 barefoot vivacious dancers. It closes with an exuberant choral chant in praise of mirth, with the naturalistic steps all being ones which everyone has experienced and can physically identify with – walking, running, skipping, jumping, spinning – though all more gracefully performed than any untrained body could achieve, which leaves the audience skipping home on a high.

The visuals reference Italy in the 1960s, courtesy of films by Fellini, Vittorio de Sica and others, and still look sharp and witty, with Aleksandra Kurzak’s Fiorilla flaunting her colourful frocks to the manner born. Caurier & Leiser manage to take the intricate comedy seriously while flinging in sight gags that are genuinely funny. The show remains a brilliantly clever piece of entertainment.Masterminding proceedings is Thomas Allen’s Prosdocimo, a librettist stuck for a plot who sees in the other characters and their situations the basis for his new creation. Alessandro Corbelli is perfection as Fiorilla’s flummoxed husband Geronio, always retaining his humanity. Colin Lee’s Narciso has some untidy moments vocally and doesn’t quite carry off the Latin lover-boy look.At the centre, Kurzak achieves star quality with the sheer personality of her capricious Fiorilla, triumphing over vocal unevenness; there are some worrying moments at the top of her voice. Ildebrando D’Arcangelo fulfils every requirement as her exotic love-object.

William Dudley’s designs offer mechanistic imagery blended with Disney-like cutesiness. The real magic of the natural world as presented in Janacek’s score is only intermittently realised. The inn scenes, full of a sense of nostalgia, loss and human disappointment, need some visual tightening.But there are some vital performances, especially from Emma Matthews’ lively Vixen, with Elisabeth Meister stepping up on the first night as cover for the Fox to present it with energy and definition. Christopher Maltman looks on the young side for the Forester, whose sympathy for the woodland creatures rises to a radiant moment of spiritual unity with them at the close.Jeremy White is game as the Badger, though the crucial moment when he is turned out of his home by the Vixen goes for little. Robin Leggate makes the Schoolmaster’s melancholy painfully real. As the villain of the piece, the poacher Harasta, Matthew Rose is big and bold but not quite nasty enough.

No major loss there. Morrell’s costumes are good at fixing the characters’ natures in the mind. Edwards’s spare sets provide atmosphere, although the absence of the ruined church in which Katya’s fragile mental state collapses and she publicly confesses her adultery is felt. It’s arguable, too, whether playing the relatively short three-act piece without any interval is a good idea. Somehow the overall impact of the evening is not quite what it should be.Yet there are many fine things. American soprano Patricia Racette, a star in the US, makes her English National Opera debut as Katya. She registers as a little mature for the part, and her voice is on the slender side – but she’s a strong actress. Stuart Skelton partners her purposefully as her vacillating lover Boris, with John Graham-Hall making a good deal of her craven, cowardly husband, Tikhon. Susan Bickley is properly appalling as Kabanicha, the mother-in-law from hell, and Alfie Boe shines in the secondary role of Kudrjas.

It takes a little while for the magic to kick in. During the first act, a lack of emphasis from the four lovers and a dearth of differentiation between the rude mechanicals – Andrew Slater’s deliberate Bottom and Mark Wilde’s intricate Flute aside – keep the piece at a distance from the audience. Confusingly similar costuming doesn’t help. But connections are made during Act II, and by Act III the production is firing on nearly all cylinders.Individual performances, however, are strong throughout. Jonathan Peter Kenny’s haughty Oberon carries a definite other-worldly charge, while Gillian Ramm’s Tytania gleams and glistens in a vocally strong interpretation. Cast against the regular traditions of the part, David Gooderson’s Puck is seasoned and expertly delivered. The junior fairies are a little tentative.Nicholas Lester’s Theseus and Lise Christensen’s Hippolyta bring some regal authority to their intervention in Act III, when the brilliant Pyramus and Thisbe parody is finely crafted and hits the target. The evening’s magic rises pure and unalloyed from the pit, where conductor Michael Rosewell delivers a secure and sheeny account of the score, relishing its moonlit half-colours and genuine sonic enchantment. By curtain time, the piece has the audience well and truly in its spell.

Carlos Acosta brings his crowd pleasing personality to the part of Colas. William Tuckett as Lise’s guardian aunt brings the right amount of underplayed music hall humour to the role of Widow Simone, especially pleasing the audience in the jaunty clog dance. Humour and pathos too from Jonathan Howells as the unfortunate Alain.This show has much to please, from the cockerel of Paul Kay, and his four hens, the real pony, the charming ribbon dance, the maypole and, typical of any English picnic, a storm. With pastoral sweetness, the rustic dances are performed with a joyous spirit, though of course Ashton’s gorgeous ensembles of villagers and harvesters have as much farm worker authenticity as Marie Antoinette did when she played at being a shepherdess. The wedding pas de deux has a beautiful elegance.This is a work of charm and each generation of dancers makes it their own, though the English schooling based on the De Valois interpretation of the Cecchetti technique seems subtly diluted, which if unchecked will change the character of the piece.Osbert Lancaster’s designs still amuse and delight, as does the score, the orchestra of the ROH being conducted by Daniel Capps. Other valuable casts perform during the run.

It’s a handsome looking show, with Agnes Treplin’s period designs suggesting the interior and exterior locations in the Spanish castle of Aguas Frescas economically, yet with unerring skill, and the pre-revolutionary context of social hierarchies starting to melt lightly sketched in.The staging is also astute in telling the story – a far from easy matter given the minute detail of the opera’s plotting. With more words coming over than they currently do, things might be clearer yet.The cast is a strong one. Laura Mitchell fields a soprano full of feeling as the countess and cuts a moving figure. Her husband’s arrogance is impressively developed by Nicholas Lester, whose aria is a highlight. Robert Davies makes a likeably engaged Figaro. Eliana Pretorian’s Susanna needs to make her quick-wittedness more visible, but her vocalism is neat and graceful.As the young page Cherubino, Niamh Kelly remains resolutely female in a male role, but again sings attractively. There are comprehensively excellent contributions from Andrew Slater’s firm Bartolo, Lise Christensen’s feisty Marcellina and especially Mark Wilde’s busybody Basilio.Best of all is Michael Rosewell’s distinguished conducting and the pristine orchestral playing, which would be hard to better. Overall this should prove a near ideal introduction to the opera as it tours Great Britain and Northern Ireland between now and the end of May.

Donizetti’s protagonist, the old miser intent on stealing a young bride, is here re-imagined as a tyrannical maestro. Agnes Treplin’s set makes a virtue of economy, whether evoking Don Pasquale’s study with a back wall plastered with pictures of himself in Toscanini-like poses or persuading us that we are backstage at the opera house. Lighting designer Matthew Haskins favours unexpectedly muted colours with plenty of blue. Costumes are Edwardian.The substantial figure of Keel Watson is on stage during the overture, not merely wielding his baton to comic effect but intervening to disrupt the musical discourse, as if at rehearsal. The conceit is typical of an effective, thoroughly theatrical evening, less concerned with grace, subtlety or charm.Mary O’Sullivan’s Norina is here a budding opera star, her suitably feisty performance growing in confidence throughout.The traditional story can seem creaky, even cruel once Pasquale starts receiving his comeuppance, so perhaps it helps to have Malatesta’s pivotal plotting re-imagined as the machinations of someone active in artist and project management.The opera plays in English without surtitles and Owen Gillhooly makes every word intelligible. As Pasquale’s nephew Ernesto, Nicholas Sharratt’s plangency can pall, but he brings some bel canto elegance to the treacherous tessitura.Detailed direction is lavished on the chorus. Notwithstanding the odd uncoordinated moment, Dominic Wheeler, the conductor in the pit, prevents the music from seeming overly formulaic through scrupulous attention to rhythm and colour. The dynamic range is wide yet never obscures the singers.

The production was very much predicated on Domingo’s vocal personality and appeal in the major role of the Emperor Bajazet, and this was likely to be one of his final appearances with the company. His illness and the need for an immediate operation put paid to all that.American tenor Kurt Streit, already due to sing the role at two performances, stepped into the remainder. Streit is a fine artist, but neither vocally nor dramatically does he raise the role of the fallen emperor with a burning hatred of his oppressor, the shepherd turned tyrant Tamerlano, to the level of tragic grandeur required.Much of what surrounds him is vocally drab. Dutch mezzo Christianne Stotijn makes a disappointing debut as Tamerlano and Christine Schafer is awkward as Bajazet’s daughter Asteria, whom Tamerlano wants to marry.Giving the show some much needed vocal authority are Sara Mingardo as Asteria’s beloved, the Greek prince Andronico – her rich contralto consistently impressive – and Croatian mezzo Renata Pokupic as Tamerlano’s betrothed Irene, princess of Trabisond, in a finely sung and acted performance. It’s not enough to save the show.Neither is the show worth saving. Designed by Richard Hudson, Graham Vick’s staging, first seen in Florence in 2001, is flippant, fussy and lacking in focus. Ivor Bolton’s conducting is correct but dutiful. Tamerlano is one of Handel’s greatest operas, but it feels a very long, slow evening here.

This is a touring showcase of new work by some of the UK’s emerging professional choreographers. The works are accompanied by an installation by Heather Eddington’s State of Flux dance film company, blending dance, film and animation.4M2 is an energetic and engaging physical theatre performance from choreographers Claire Cunningham and Jose Agudo, combining real stories, a filmic backdrop and a multi-layered soundscape.Cabin Fever by Tom Dale is enigmatic, intriguing and a very well made piece for Stephen Moynihan. Lost in a world of his own, the character’s cabin fever and mental twists produce an exhilarating and powerful performance. This expressive and physical work is a metaphor for a state of mind but it isn’t clear what is tormenting this troubled lone figure. The choreography is excellent, no move is wasted and it works well on the long back and body of superb dancer Moynihan.Passing Strange and Wonderful by Ben Wright is an intense physical conversation for the two fine performers, Kier Patrick and Lise Manavit. Framed by fluttering light, it shows the desire to break through barriers between a couple with expressive  moments of soft tenderness and insatiable desire.With the current poor triple bill of modern works by the Royal Ballet on the main stage, this is a tonic in its studio theatre for all who appreciate contemporary dance and its future.

In their un-surtitled ENO production of 1997, revived now by David Kneuss with many original cast members, Phelim McDermott and Julian Crouch go their own way – up to a point. Even for this theatrical director-designer partnership in this totemic venue, Satyagraha plays in Sanskrit. The libretto, derived by Constance de Jong from the Bhagavada Gita, is plundered for key phrases which are projected, sporadically, in English across the semicircular, corrugated, wall-like set.Evoking Mahatma Gandhi’s early years in South Africa and his spiritual progress towards satyagraha (resistance to oppression by non-violent means), we have a series of tableaux vivants which eschew linearity and politics in favour of contemplative abstraction. Historical icons – admired (Tolstoy, Tagore) or admiring (Martin Luther King) – are discreetly referenced upstage while Improbable’s brilliant troupe of physical actors, puppeteers and illusionists set about the creation of mythological beasts (Hindu gods?) from papier-mache and thin air. Kevin Pollard’s costumes, surprisingly in period, and Paule Constable’s lighting contribute their own magic.Act 2 brings the biggest blast of energy. Molested on the streets of Durban, Alan Oke’s poignant Gandhi is protected by redoubtable Mrs Alexander in a new and feisty impersonation by Anne Mason. And in the next scene’s pseudo-quintet, Elena Xanthoudakis’ Miss Schlesen and Janis Kelly’s Mrs Naidoo prove impervious to strain. The difficulty is that the young activist whose beliefs will change the course of history is ultimately rendered as a figure of lonely inaction. His Act 3 soliloquy, musically all scales, is dramatically comatose. Still, the audience seems prepared to make the required leap of faith. For the most part, conductor Stuart Stratford secures amazingly precise work, given the stupefyingly repetitive nature of the score.

The locale is transferred to the American Midwest in the fifties, with Kelley Rourke’s sweet and sassy translation articulated by the cast with appropriate accents. In Isabella Bywater’s bright and breezy set, the action takes place in and around Adina’s Diner, the popular local eatery where the owner – Sarah Tynan’s Marilyn Monroe-lookalike Adina – is as much in demand as the food she serves. Together with the smart period costumes and quack doctor Dr Dulcamara’s roadster, the visuals combine to form an iconic image of fifties Americana. It’s a delightful looking show.It sounds pretty good, too. John Tessier fields a clean lyric tenor in his personification of mechanic Nemorino, eating his heart out for the best looking gal in town, and rises to a superb account of his big aria to crown a genuinely touching performance. Sarah Tynan matches him note for note in her pristine singing, without quite avoiding a suggestion of hardness in Adina’s character that needs to melt a little more visibly. But that the two young leads are both so good looking is a definite plus.David Kempster is solid as the brash Sergeant Belcore, the local military ladies’ man and Andrew Shore’s Dulcamara is expertly done, with a brilliant Elvis impersonation thrown in. Making his debut is the Spanish conductor Pablo Heras-Casado, who delivers an immaculately neat performance, just a shade short on theatrical punch and impetus.

Opportunities for lyricism are few in this tale of Alexei’s obsession with the fickle, unstable Polina, whose guardian, the General, is his employer. The General has bankrupted himself at the tables and hopes that the arrival of his elderly aunt will save his financial bacon. But she too gets the gambling bug and loses his much looked forward to inheritance. The result is a grotesque and surreal comedy, with no likeable characters but with plenty of energy and some memorable scenes.It’s very much Richard Jones territory and his sharp-edged, satirical production to Weimar Republic designs by Antony McDonald and Nicky Gillibrand presents the ambience with poster paint brilliance. Antonio Pappano conducts a terrific account that balances the music’s brutalist vitality and momentum while allowing the voices to come through. Sterling performances from the large cast, with John Tomlinson’s bewildered General, Kurt Streit’s super-suave Marquis and Jurgita Adamonyte’s flouncy Blanche all exceptional.

In her torment, Lucia murders her husband on their wedding night and begins to imagine her wedding with Edgardo in the ensuing Mad Scene. Learning of Lucia’s death, caused by her madness, Edgardo kills himself.The monochrome look for the sets and costumes captures Lucia’s faceless, male-dominated milieu, though it sometimes fights with Donizetti’s often rather colourful score. Alden also adds an intensifying twist to Enrico’s manipulation of his sister, who, here portrayed as a young girl, becomes an all-round plaything, even on a sexual level. In her tryst with Edgardo, and in her Mad Scene, she appears on a stage within the stage – by contrast, the duel scene plays out from behind the flats of that false stage. Are those gathered on stage to watch her performances remote voyeurs, disinterested in her plight? And are we the same?What is evident is the high standards of execution. Anna Christy sings the title role with laudable agility and musters considerable power, despite her light, youthful tone. Barry Banks as Edgardo is endlessly thrilling and fearless. And while Clive Bayley makes a fine character role of the chaplain Raimondo, Brian Mulligan (Enrico) stands out for his richly furnished and tonally varied baritone. He should be asked to return soon and the same goes for Antony Walker, making a strong impression in his ENO debut.

The command of tone is flawless, and number after number hits its mark. The entire second act – especially a resplendently high-energy Gothic-comic ghost scene – goes with unerring spirit.It’s a strong cast, too, from top to bottom. Amy Freston’s gracefully strait-laced Rose Maybud falls for the attractions of Grant Doyle’s decent but dull Robin Oakapple, while Heather Shipp’s crazed Mad Margaret eventually finds happiness and a sort of sanity in the arms of Richard Burkhard’s stylishly satanic Sir Despard Murgatroyd. Anne-Marie Owens’s solid Dame Hannah, Richard Angas’ loyal Old Adam Goodheart and Steven Page’s vividly sung Sir Roderic all come to life, with Hal Cazalet’s lithe Dick Dauntless supplying numerous nautical interventions.Crucially, director Davies has understood that for Gilbert’s subversive stage logic to work, the participants have to take their increasingly ridiculous plight seriously. Here the result is not just a major hit for Opera North but one of the best Gilbert and Sullivan productions for decades.

Vast audiences will have caught this wonderful show.Miller’s largely self-designed and locally resourced modern-dress staging, replete with mobile phones and laptops, is inexpensive to mount but still looks clean, elegant and genuinely cool. It must be one of the best investments the company has ever made. Witty, profound and apparently endlessly revivable, it never fails, and certainly doesn’t on this occasion.The largely young cast forms a perfect ensemble, skilled and detailed in their acting and brilliant in some sure-fire comic routines. Vocally, Maria Bengtsson’s Fiordiligi tires a little but otherwise shows consistent intelligence and purpose. She’s perfectly partnered by Jurgita Adamonyte as her flightier sister, Dorabella.Like Bengtsson, Pavol Breslik’s Ferrando sounds a little worn in Act II but he’s generally persuasive and stylish. So too, is Stephane Degout’s macho-man Guglielmo, firmly and vividly in character. Thomas Allen, who turned 66 on the first night of the run, remains a masterly, conscienceless Alfonso, manipulating everyone in sight. Vocally and dramatically, Rebecca Evans is a Despina of the highest possible class.Making an extremely auspicious debut with the company is German conductor Thomas Hengelbrock. His highly individual interpretative touches convince, and the orchestra plays sensationally well for him.

Partly, Ingo Metzmacher’s conducting is more dynamic and theatrical than his predecessor’s, though it could still do with more character. But also the cast this time is that bit more focused and, in fact, near ideal.Toby Spence as the foolish young Tom Rakewell brings a delicate lyrical shine to Stravinsky’s clean line, his downfall inevitable in his every note and gesture. Rosemary Joshua presents Anne Trulove’s vulnerability and determination perfectly and her vocalism is impeccable. Jeremy White is a humane representative of solid middle class values as her father. As the devil Nick Shadow, Kyle Ketelsen mesmerises with his dark tone and his menacing presence. Patricia Bardon returns as Baba the Turk and in enjoying herself hugely, ensures the audience does, too. The ever delightful Frances McCafferty’s appearances as an outrageous Mother Goose are unflawed.The production updates the 18th-century London of WH Auden and Chester Kallman’s brilliant libretto to a fifties Americana visualised in Hollywood and TV imagery – thus the presence of some very British bobbies looks odd. But it’s unfailingly clever and moves nicely, even though it places the interval in an oddly ineffective place. Rarely does this subtle yet potent work pack such a definite punch.

And I think it should be shocking”.The story is well known. Girl meets boy and then some more boys, and then dies for her sins. The original setting was written as being in the 1830s. This production is updated to the Spanish Civil War of the thirties, without any appreciable alteration to the theme.The opening, however, is a revelation of design and direction. The curtain shows a ragged red line which opens to portray two dancers performing to the background of the overture. This is very visual, as is the rest of the production, helped considerably by the design flair of Rob Howell and his use of a revolve to change the scenes.The cast fills the stage and if one is to have a small quibble, it is that the eye is distracted from the singer to the fidgeting behind.As Carmen, Elina Garanca has the looks and the voice to fully justify her casting. The rest of the cast are somewhat overshadowed by her performance and can be said to perform adequately.This Carmen is, however, because of the vast expanse of a production and cast, a worthy successor to the many previous reprisals.

The rising star Polish tenor Piotr Beczala, apparently recovering from a cold, was clearly below his best and withdrew halfway through, to be replaced by the young Romanian Teodor Ilincai, due to take over later in this double and triple-cast run. Ilincai made a decent impression, but the show lost its impetus at this point and never really recovered.But there were good elements. Russian Hibla Gerzmava is an attractively lyrical Mimi, though she does not touch the heart. The three other Bohemians – Gabriele Viviani’s Marcello, Jacques Imbrailo’s Schaunard and Kostas Smoriginas’s Colline – form a lively, good-humoured trio. There are scene-stealing cameos from Jeremy White as Benoit and Donald Maxwell as Alcindoro, though Russian-American Inna Dukach’s Musetta is vocally too lightweight.Making his Covent Garden debut in the pit is the Latvian conductor Andris Nelsons, music director of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. He starts well, with plenty of detail and vitality in the first two acts, then succumbs to the loss of focus that kicks in with the change of tenors.Copley’s traditional production, to the late Julia Trevelyan Oman’s period sets, still gives good value but looks its age and more. Time for a Bohemian makeover at Covent Garden.

Three years later, following a tour and now in the Royal Opera House’s Linbury Studio, it is, if anything, even better.The score is accessible – ranging from lively musical theatre numbers to soaring opera – without being overly simplistic, while the libretto gives a knowing modern take on a classic Romanian fairy tale, in which a princess is fated to marry a pig, before discovering the transformative powers of love.If there was one criticism of the original production it was that some of the lyrics got a bit lost in the (slightly larger) space of the Young Vic. No such problems here – a mixture of the smaller environs of the Linbury and the beautifully clear singing from the superb cast means that not a word is lost – something that is really crucial for younger audiences.And this is an opera that those younger audiences will genuinely enjoy – playing to the kids without dumbing down the music or the quality of the production, which is magnificent thanks to Dick Bird’s wonderful metallic set design and cartoonish costumes.

His traditional visuals still provide good value in this latest realisation, directed by Andrew Sinclair, though they could be more subtly lit. Though the staging has lost focus – the Marschallin’s levee scene is fuzzy and the crucial Presentation of the Rose scene lacks brilliance – the principal roles are well sung.As the Marschallin, Soile Isokoski offers taste and discretion, though not enough charisma for this starring role. Unusually, she cedes the final bow to Sophie Koch’s Octavian, which is nominally the title role but not generally understood to be the central point of the audience’s sympathies. Koch too is strong vocally, her firm mezzo fleshing out the lines with impact, but she never convinces as a teenage boy. Lucy Crowe enhances her reputation with a sweetly sung Sophie, though again, rarely touches the heart. Peter Rose’s Baron Ochs has an impressive evening vocally, but he fails to get to the heart of a monster who must retain some sympathy. Even Thomas Allen’s amiably camp Faninal misses the point.The score is part magic, part note-spinning – a good performance can disguise its weaknesses. Kirill Petrenko’s conducting is determined, but charmless. On this occasion, the trick does not work.

English National Opera, meanwhile, has pipped them to the post with this first staging of a work that is a contemplation of the significance of Christ and contains very little narrative.The spirit behind the project is Deborah Warner, whose previous ENO productions include Bach’s St John Passion, a piece that also threw up predictably intractable problems when transferred to the stage for which it was never intended.Warner’s applied sequence of images utilises Handel’s score as a background to an everyday contemporary setting visualised in Tom Pye’s set and Moritz Junge’s costumes. We might be in London today. Individual scenes – a woman giving birth to a baby, a victimised male, a large silent part for an engaging child (Max Craig) – are placed within a larger frame that incorporates ten dancers (Kim Brandstrup’s choreography slides almost imperceptibly in and out at various points), 16 additional children and a 44-strong silent community ensemble recruited locally. At best, the result runs at a tangent to Handel’s religious concerns. Aiming at a feel-good factor that is only occasionally achieved, the show’s overall effect is bland.With choral entries often untidy and little punch at the big moments, Laurence Cummings’ conducting needs to galvanise the score more.

The story – based on Gogol – is light hearted and fantastical. Young Ukrainian villager Vakula the smith is in love with pretty Oxana, but she wants him to fetch her a pair of slippers worn by the Tsarina herself as the price of her love. His mother Solokha the witch, meanwhile, is the target of the amorous attention of just about every middle-aged man in the village, including the devil himself, on whose back Vakula flies to St Petersburg to gain his much needed prize.The lame visualisation of the flying episode, however, in Mikhail Mokrov’s traditional designs, is symptomatic of a staging that doesn’t deliver enough of the fantasy and magic that the piece requires. The main comic scene – wherein all Solokha’s would-be lovers hide in sacks in her cottage – is as dull as ditchwater. Things perk up marginally in the St Petersburg court scene, where the Royal Ballet provides the dancers and Alastair Marriott the choreography, and Sergei Leiferkus supplies such much-needed class in his appearance as His Highness. Much of the rest is tedious.Even some of the largely Russian cast disappoint – given the Christmas panto nature of the entertainment, it would have been better to sing the opera in English – and Alexander Polianichko’s lumpy conducting fails to save the day.

Other than that, they share a common background in the sophisticated handling of folk-inspired musical material.Kramer and his designer, Giles Cadle, give us a version of Bluebeard whose setting looks like the basement of a serial killer’s home. As his new wife, Judith, explores each forbidden door of his creepy establishment, we get closer to a dark truth that is revealed more or less as the home life of the Austrian Josef Fritzl, who imprisoned his daughter in the cellar and fathered seven children by her. The problem is that such an approach denies us the wider resonances of a piece about human secrecy and unknowability. A myth has been turned into a horror story.Reliable vocal performances from both Michaela Martens’s Judith and Clive Bayley’s Bluebeard are pluses, as is Edward Gardner’s conducting in both scores. After the interval, Keegan-Dolan gives us a 20th century Irish vision of The Rite, designed by Rae Smith, with pagan influences and much of the broader outline retained – yet once again the result feels reductive compared to the original frame.

Thomas Arne was born in the Covent Garden area in 1710 and died there 68 years later. He wrote some 90 stage works, many of them for the Theatre Royal, predecessor of today’s Royal Opera House. With the tercentenary of his birth coming up, the Royal Opera revives one of his most important scores, which was a hit from 1762 up to the 1830s.In Artaxerxes, Arne produced the English-language equivalent of the Italian opera serias then fashionable all over Europe, himself translating a libretto by the Italian writer Metastasio. Taking place in ancient Persia, the plot tells a tale of murder and false accusation, in which the king’s minister, Artabanes, has murdered King Xerxes, though it is his innocent son Arbaces who gets the blame. As is the way in opera seria, right eventually triumphs.On the way, the characters sing a sequence of arias and the odd duet in early classical style, many of them extremely virtuosic but more than presentably delivered here by the cast. Martin Duncan’s staging to Johan Engels’s designs matches the formality of the genre with intensely colourful visuals, including a resplendent throne and gorgeous costumes. Ian Page conducts the Orchestra of the Classical Opera Company in what proves to be a worthwhile revival of the once famous piece.

Algiers is the title of this one, set amidst the rich and famous floating around on yachts in the Mediterranean, having affairs and emotional crises.As modern versions of Rossini’s piece about a young Italian captive taking control of the ruler of Algiers and his harem go, it’s not a bad fit – though with piracy of the kind that inspired the piece back in 1813 so much in the news, some of its serious background gets thrown overboard. But only rarely does McColl’s staging run out of steam and the way in which the audience sees the show being filmed is brilliantly done.Individual performances are strong, with Karen Cargill’s Isabella firing on all vocal cylinders and surfing gracefully through the coloratura. Thomas Walker relishes playing the handsome young playboy Lindoro, with Tiziano Bracci amiably bumptious as his super-rich senior competitor, Mustafa. Adrian Powter’s hyperactive portrayal of Isabella’s mature companion Taddeo and Mary O’Sullivan’s neat depiction of Mustafa’s cast-off wife Elvira fit beautifully into the picture. Conductor Wyn Davies brings vitality to the score and the show gets a joyous reception from the Glasgow audience, which bodes well for its tour of Scotland’s major venues.

Tobias Hoheisel’s picturesque designs, now slightly dated and a tad overlit by Paul Hastie, evoke a conventional order, a normality that perhaps has only ever existed on the surface of things.Although less than stellar, the cast, expertly coached by conductor Robin Ticciati and revival director Daniel Dooner, is up to the composer’s idiosyncratic demands. With a tried and tested mixture of stiff formality and desperate emotion, Anne Mason’s Kostelnicka makes her fateful decision to murder her stepdaughter’s baby seem real. Giselle Allen, in her company debut, is a worthy Jenufa but sometimes fails to move us, the voice better at conveying anxiety and resolution than simple warmth. Peter Wedd copes well as a difficult, near-psychopathic Laca, while the conventionally dissolute Steva is entrusted to Pavel Cernoch, the one Czech singer in the cast. Susan Gorton returns to the production, a substantial, caring Grandmother Buryjovka.In the pit Robin Ticciati elicits softer-grained sonorities than is customary in this score – Janacek’s sound world loses a certain sharp-edged specificity. Not that there is any want of passion as the Kostelnicka goes to face judgment, leaving a vengeful mob to wreck her property – Lehnhoff’s symbolism rather than the composer’s. As always, the radiant, redemptive postscript has emotive force and universal resonance. Life goes on. The wheel turns. There is hope.

As in 2007 the show looks mightily impressive.Despite a small army of scene-shifters, the stage is largely bare – Tanya McCallin’s period costumes are dwarfed by the larger abstractions of her sliding-panel set and Adam Silverman’s bold monochrome lighting.The original female principals excel, even if Ann Murray’s Mrs Grose and especially Nazan Fikret’s ASBO-ready Flora now seem mature for their roles. Michael Colvin’s articulate, insinuating Peter Quint and Charlie Manton’s weirdly affecting Miles are new. Perhaps the biggest change is inspired by the participation of Charles Mackerras who first conducted the work in the fifties and has been working with this company for an incredible 61 years. His tauter pacing is all to the good, tightening dramatic and musical tensions which now move in tandem.So who is fantasising and who represents the evil that pervades the house? Is Rebecca Evans’ sensitive, soft-grained governess the victim or does she set the whole thing in train through her own unnatural obsessions and insecurities? Quint and Jessel are mute ghosts in the Henry James novella, but Britten gives each a voice and, as in many recent productions, McVicar wants to make tangible the forces of good and evil.Horror film cliche is only narrowly averted when Cheryl Barker’s glamorous Jessel is pulled from her grave by Michael Colvin’s Quint – there’s a sort of justification for it in Flora’s burial of her doll. While the claustrophobia of Britten’s conception may be undersold, ENO’s large-scale interpretation seems more viable when his 13-strong instrumental group is marshalled with such skill.

His subsequent madness and his daughter’s attempts to comfort him provide a scene of unusual power in a work that aims consistently high. Why this marvellous piece is not more frequently performed is a mystery.Certainly the singers here give it their best shot. Leading from the front is the American soprano Barbara Quintiliani, a real discovery, whose substantial voice and technical accomplishment keep the character and her plight at the centre of attention.As Don Pedro, her errant royal lover, Italian baritone Marco Caria is dynamic and arresting.In the unusual role of Maria’s father, Don Ruiz, the Welsh tenor Adriano Graziani charts the course of the character’s disintegration imaginatively.They would do better in a production with stronger individual direction than Marco Gandini provides and whose visuals, by designers Mauro Tinti and Silvia Aymonino, are eccentric and unhelpful.

Happily, they eventually seem to get the general idea. The score is an utter charmer, and solidly conducted here by Christopher Franklin, with Lorenzo Cutuli’s grand set and Claudia Pernigotti’s period costumes conjuring up a Rosenkavalier-like ambience. Paula Murrihy’s sparkling Helene, Luca Dall’Amico’s crisp Pausanias and especially Kishani Jayasinghe’s stylish Gontran carry the day, and the result is a winner.Things go downhill, unfortunately, after the interval, where Rossini’s early and basically straightforward comedy – about a Canadian visitor to London involved in a marriage contract from which he tactfully withdraws when he realises he’s not wanted – is updated to 2049, with portentous suggestions of futuristic technologies laid all over it. Quotations from The Tempest and Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World are flashed up on screen, although their purpose and indeed the whole point of the makeover remain utterly inscrutable.The show also suffers from some poor singing and some intrusive musical jokes from the forte-piano, although Franklin once again provides firm musical direction.

William M Hoffman’s libretto is set in a kind of limbo where the characters of Beaumarchais’ plays – best known from their operatic adaptations as Mozart’s Marriage of Figaro and Rossini’s Barber of Seville – meet up with the ghosts of Beaumarchais, Marie Antoinette, her husband King Louis XVI and others of the period. Beaumarchais tries to stop Marie Antoinette’s execution by entering the drama himself, though eventually she refuses his aid.It’s a complex, highly artificial literary conceit that gives Corigliano the opportunity for quoting and copying Mozart, Rossini and innumerable other composers. Though his pastiches are not top-drawer, they provide the most memorable parts of the score. Under his own steam, his music takes in a few modernist tricks but is otherwise bland and uneventful. A large-scale Turkish finale to Act I, originally written as a vehicle for Marilyn Horne, seems utterly redundant.If the work itself is tedious, James Robinson’s staging, with clever designs by Allen Moyer and James Schuette, possesses energy and narrative clarity. The cast does a presentable job with weak material – Maria Kanyova’s Marie Antoinette and George von Bergen’s Beaumarchais are determined and Kishani Jayasinghe’s Rosina charming. But there must be better American operas than this to introduce to European audiences.

Ravel’s suggestive farce Spanish Time shows clockmaker’s wife Concepcion dallying with her various lovers while her husband is out, with a hunky muleteer unwittingly moving them around the house in clock cases. Puccini’s mordant comedy presents wily peasant Gianni Schicchi helping a wealthy Florentine family alter the will of their deceased relative, but grabbing the big prizes for himself. Both go like clockwork in these impeccably stylish productions, with John Macfarlane and Nicky Gillibrand’s designs immaculately judged and the witty stagings flawlessly realised. In these two ensemble pieces, the Royal Opera is at its best.The casts are choice, too, though with tight playing from everyone on stage, the impression is of a perfectly aligned company achievement. But mention must be made of Ruxandra Donose’s blowsy Concepcion, Christopher Maltman’s laid-back Ramiro and Andrew Shore’s spry Don Inigo in Ravel’s sex comedy. In Puccini’s Ortonesque Gianni Schicchi, Sir Thomas Allen’s title role is a tour de force, while Gwynne Howell celebrates 40 seasons on the Covent Garden stage with his superbly articulated Simone and Janis Kelly’s house debut as Nella is very welcome. Stephen Costello and Maria Bengtsson are delightful young lovers.

Conway’s production, played in a single set by Joanna Parker whose back wall opens up to offer tiny snapshots of activity and uses colour to great effect, consistently focuses on character and action. The eighteenth century formal dress is handsome and apt.But in Handel, singing and its dramatic meaning matters most of all. ETO has put together an evenly-balanced cast, all of them up to the work’s major demands. Countertenor Clint van der Linde suggests nicely the vacillating nature of Flavio himself, the fierce rivalry between his two elderly counsellors, Lotario and Ugone, is brilliantly presented by Andrew Slater and Joseph Cornwell respectively, and the four young lovers are all striking. It makes for a highly enjoyable evening, well worth catching, along with the rest of Handelfest, as it tours over the next few weeks.

After staging his first great opera, Jenufa, in 1904, Janacek spent a decade trying to turn two of Mr Broucek’s adventures – the first to the moon, the second to 15th-century Prague – into an opera. Innumerable librettists worked on the piece and the result, unveiled in 1920, still has awkward corners – the 15th-century episode includes endless discussion about religious factions that seems pretty arcane to a contemporary British audience. But the score – luminously attractive in lunar mode, warlike in Prague — comes up fresh as paint as conducted by Martin Andre and with Opera North’s chorus and orchestra on splendid form.The show also benefits from clever and stylish designs by Alex Lowde, who conjures up a particularly witty moon scene – the production links the period of the Apollo missions with the crushing of the Prague Spring by Soviet forces in 1968 – and from intelligent and unfailingly skilful direction from John Fulljames, surely the leading UK opera director of his generation.Opera North fields a fine cast, too, most of them tripling up as Moon people and both ancient and modern inhabitants of Prague, with John Graham-Hall tirelessly determined as the flummoxed, cowardly Broucek.

And Chinese and spectacular it is, visually – though not in a traditional way. Miriam Buether’s sets and Katrina Lindsay’s costumes move us from legendary Peking to a contemporary Chinese restaurant, the first two acts set among the customers, the third in the kitchen, where Liu’s torture is enacted with cooking utensils – she finishes herself off by drinking a bottle of bleach. The customers are a diverse lot, in a weird mixture of dress – Elvis impersonators, a couple of Chelsea pensioners, Margaret Thatcher, a party of Hasidic Jews, you name it. But more damaging is a new character, called The Writer, played by Scott Handy, who starts scribbling his story as the opera kicks off and then manipulates the action as it goes on. Eventually he loses control and is finished off by Turandot’s sword as she admits her love for Calaf. A drama that encompasses an ancient fertility myth of winter giving way to spring, political and psychological resonances and a battle of the sexes is reduced to an individual fantasy. Big deal.Thank god for the musical side. Edward Gardner conducts a thrilling account of the magnificent score and Amanda Echalaz sings a world-class Liu. Gwyn Hughes Jones is a vocally handsome Calaf and Kirsten Blanck, though uncharismatic and hideously dressed, has all the notes for Turandot. But the production gets nowhere near the heart of Puccini’s darkest masterpiece.

Luis soon loses interest in his wife – unsurprisingly, as it was his father Eugenio who had put him up to winning Analia’s affections in order to acquire her inherited land.Heavily coloured – perhaps too obviously so – by Latin-American rhythms, Alberga’s score also often appears crude in its literal reflections of word references in the libretto and in its overuse of the ‘magical’ wind chimes. Strangely, Alberga passed over the chance to include an exuberant Latin-American number at the wedding of Analia and Luis. While the ensemble writing is well handled – and there are some especially effective, bittersweet lyrical wind lines – Alberta’s vocal writing tends to elongate the libretto, leading to the feeling of an essentially slow pace throughout.There are some fine performances, though. Mary Plazas is ideal as the long-suffering, impractically idealistic but headstrong Analia, singing with abandon, if with occasionally indistinct English. Jonathan May is a rich-toned Eugenio, though his characterisation is rather cardboardy. On the other hand, Christopher Steele keenly projects Luis’ hedonistic and violent outlook, though he would benefit from a touch more vocal sophistication.Luis’ death seems rather sudden, as does Analia’s summary dismissal of Eugenio, and then there’s the twist that opens the door to true happiness. Despite these weaknesses, the cast and players, conducted by Michael Rafferty, do a fine job.

Tanya McCallin’s looming terracotta set is repositioned to showcase a series of busy, large-scale tableaux that look best from the cheap seats (the choreographer is Arthur Pita). As with most musicals, there’s less room for probing psychological insights.The polyglot cast is rather shown up by Roberto Alagna. Taking a while to find his best vocal form in what is surprisingly his first Don Jose in the UK, he does make every word intelligible. Back in the role of Escamillo, that fine singer Ildebrando D’Arcangelo looks tremendous but struggles with both the low-lying tessitura and the French text. He enters on horseback in an extravaganza that also gives us a live donkey – twice. Another remarkable artist, the affecting Liping Zhang is not entirely at ease with Micaela.Elina Garanca’s Carmen provides the star turn. With her superbly focused, honeyed tone, perfect intonation and elegant physical presence, she lacks the tigerish qualities – and the castanets – often associated with the heroine. She does all that the production requires of her in the way of sexual innuendo, yet turns almost regal in her moving final scene with Alagna, played out on a deserted stage with the set reconfigured to represent the curve of Seville’s bullring. Were the production style more radical, one might conclude that some ideological point about social mobility is being made. The smaller parts include a game Frasquita from Eri Nakamura.Notwithstanding a few problems of co-ordination with the stage, Bertrand de Billy conducts with some pizzazz.

Much of the acting would be hard to surpass.And the singing, too. Ben Heppner’s lumbering Tristan, sadness dripping from his every pore, lasts the enormous trajectory of the role virtually unscathed. Nina Stemme crowns a blistering account of Isolde’s curse in Act I and a radiant contribution to the love duet with a Liebestod that could not be improved on this side of Wagnerian heaven.Michael Volle is a tireless, engaged Kurwenal. Sophie Koch’s finely envisioned Brangane is sung with flawless poise. John Tomlinson’s King Mark is a Lear-like human figure, destroyed by his betrayal.The orchestra is magnificent, with conductor Antonio Pappano achieving miraculous feats of balance and superb continuity.

But the show looks good and is straightforward in telling its tale of the emotionally isolated poet Werther and his hopeless love for Charlotte, who suppresses her own feelings for him to marry the dull but worthy Albert because of a promise made to her dying mother.Peter Savidge makes a credible foil out of Albert. Donald Maxwell sings the role of Charlotte’s father, the Magistrate, a genial but proper figure of the local community. Richard Burkhard and Joshua Ellicott provide a nice double act as Johann and Schmidt, who drink their lives away in the local pub. Fflur Wynn is perfect as Charlotte’s younger sister Sophie, battling with her own feelings for the poet.But the opera hangs on the two big roles of Werther and Charlotte, sung by Paul Nilon and Alice Coote. Neither is ideal. Nilon’s limited tenor doesn’t always cut through, and when it does it lacks a glossy sheen. Coote sings better but rarely suggests Charlotte’s warmth and never her fragility.But conductor Richard Farnes brings sweep and passion to an interpretation that rises to appreciable heights in the orchestral playing.

It is unfortunately a self-regarding and indulgent piece of choreography. There is a limit to the number of times one can bear to watch a dancer walk on stage, take a swig out of a water bottle then lie down and stretch, or view cartwheels. It could have been fascinating to see the street dancers working with ballet and contemporary dancers, especially as they all had a high standard. Maybe this was an interesting experience for the performers to undergo, though hardly a revelatory one, and perhaps it appeals to the voyeurism of some of the public, who like to watch rehearsals more than performances but this hotch-potch stew didn’t have an attractive flavour of its own. It was a wasted opportunity as the scrappy movement fragments were dull, save for a solo by Thomas Whithead and a duet with Steven McRae and Tamara Rojo.

The risk is that familiarity will breed if not contempt, then perhaps a certain cosiness.Having Miller himself back at the helm has tightened things up, even if the concept never quite works in respect of Gilda, Rigoletto’s now implausibly closeted daughter. Unlike some of her predecessors, Katherine Whyte, the young Canadian soprano making her UK debut, looks right, toying with her hair during her big number in a typical Millerish piece of observation. She is, however, as yet vocally overstretched. Not so Anthony Michaels-Moore’s practiced Rigoletto – he dominates their scenes together. If some will take issue with the relatively limited evidence of his disability, confined to the occasional lurch, the character’s frustration and bitterness does register and the text is always cleanly articulated. More fine, idiomatic singing comes from Iain Paterson’s Monterone. Brindley Sherratt convinces again as granitic, black-hearted Sparafucile.The cocktail lounge scenes find the chorus in fine fettle but need they be such abstemious smokers? Just one cigar is flourished. The Edward Hopper-esque bar for the final Act still looks a treat (the design is by Patrick Robertson and Rosemary Vercoe, with lighting by Robert Bryan). Here Madeleine Shaw shines in the relatively small part of Maddalena.Long associated with Boston Lyric Opera and now at Saint Louis, the conductor Stephen Lord makes his UK opera debut in the pit. He secures sensitive, accommodating, unforced playing which ultimately underwhelms. A characteristically roomy tempo is set for Michael Fabiano’s La donna e mobile, where Miller’s old jukebox joke still raises a laugh.

The late Hungarian composer’s only opera, first staged in 1978 and previously presented by ENO in 1982, returns in a new and visually unforgettable production by the Catalan theatre collective La Fura dels Baus, whose use of lighting and film increases the eye-popping nature of this tale of Death, in the person of Nekrotzar, visiting the all too human kingdom of Brueghelland to announce the imminent apocalypse.Darkly comic in its commentary on human nature, with its childish figures of power, drunkards and sexual pleasure-seekers, the piece is set to a sharply modernist score that scarcely sounds one idea before leaping to something radically different. Baldur Bronnimann conducts a brilliant musical realisation that jostles constantly with the visuals for the centre of attention.Brilliant though the individual performances are, the set overshadows them. But Pavlo Hunka is a commanding Nekrotzar, Wolfgang Ablinger-Sperrhacke’s Piet the Pot an irredeemable wastrel, Susan Bickley’s Mescalina a terrifying sexual dominatrix and Andrew Watts an amiably effete Prince Go-Go. The prettily intertwining young lovers – Frances Bourne’s Amando and Rebecca Bottone’s Amanda – grasp the message of enjoying life while you can, long before it’s underlined at the close.

The auto-da-fe scene, with fanatical priests and jubilant crowds cheering on the burning of heretics, remains mixed, with some additional spoken lines a directorial intervention too far. But some top-class singing keeps the long and ambitious score in the air for much of the evening. The familiar Italian translation of the French original is used.New is Jonas Kaufmann’s lyrical Don Carlos, who rises impressively to the heftier moments and maintains a genuine commitment to the drama. American mezzo Marianne Cornetti hits the spot as a potent Princess Eboli and John Tomlinson is a tower of strength as the Grand Inquisitor. Much of the rest is as before, though sometimes improved. Ferruccio Furlanetto remains a rock-solid King Philip, with much of the complexity of the vulnerable tyrant on display. Marina Poplavskaya has acquired greater consistency as Elisabeth, her drawn face and sculpted vocal lines expressing the character’s stoical sense of loss. Robert Lloyd’s appearances as the supposedly dead Charles V are properly momentous.In two elements, the performance could scarcely be improved. One is the superbly sung Posa of Simon Keenlyside, who leaves no corner of his character unrevealed. The other is Semyon Bychkov’s conducting, which brings out the unutterable dignity and pathos of the extraordinary score.

Acoustically, it’s not an ideal location – the sound system is crude and failed sporadically on opening night – but the artistic credentials of the show are solid and the piece works just as it should.On a minor textual point, the reinstatement of the cut aria for Sergeant Meryll holds up the action, which is presumably why Gilbert cut it. But it is well sung by Bruce Graham and the cast includes several distinguished singers who make sure Sullivan’s vocal writing registers with distinction.Peter Mulloy’s self-designed production offers a highly effective piece of period drama. The dialogue scenes go well and the chorus, bolstered by members of the National Youth Theatre, knows exactly what it is doing. Under conductor Wyn Davies, the score moves nicely, though there’s the odd minor orchestral blip.Paul Nicholas presents a movingly vulnerable Jack Point, rhythmically wayward but spot-on in characterisation. He is well partnered by Charlotte Page’s lucid and expressive Elsie Maynard. Donald Maxwell fields a grotesquely jovial Wilfred Shadbolt, Susan Gorton is the redoubtable Dame Carruthers and Victoria Byron’s Phoebe is alive with feeling. With strong support from the rest of the company, this is an impressive and entirely enjoyable realisation of one of the Victorian era’s finest artistic creations.

But Mitch Sebastian fuses them together with a thread of choreography that digs deep into the soul and speaks volumes about the human condition.It is consummately beautiful. He opens with the outrageously costumed and impudent Baroque, a tapestry of eight arias from eight composers. Without drawing breath and with a studied intensity that never lapses, it moves seamlessly from the mischief of Mozart’s The Magic Flute into the medieval fires and skulls of Handel’s Rinaldo.Act II exchanges gilded extravagance for a war montage, a poignant and exuberant story set in the simplicity of a family home and a recording studio in forties Madrid. There is pure sensuousness in arias like Catalini’s Ebben, Ne Andro Lontana, physical comedy in the Drinking Song from La Traviata and electrifying flamenco from Carmen.And then it turns into the Electronic Revolution. Every stop is pulled out for the huge rock gig that is Nights in White Satin, before Laura Stanford’s solo violin sets the stage alight. Her whirlwind Bach taunts dancer Dharmesh Patel into ever new heights of daring until he surrenders and the mood slips into the rhapsody of Dvorak’s Song to the Moon.The performances from just four singers, five dancers and eight musicians are faultless. It is an explosion of light and colour and it burns itself on the mind.

Even more than The Ring, this opera is the hallmark of Bayreuth. For a number of years after Richard Wagner’s death, performing Parsifal was not allowed except in the Bayreuth Festspielhaus. When the festivals were revived in 1951 after the Second World War, it was produced and designed by his grandson Wieland Wagner and was probably his finest work. It remained in the repertory with only Wieland’s minor adjustments for 23 seasons. Then Wieland’s brother Wolfgang produced another Parsifal that was equally good and apart from another production by an outside producer which was given for a few years, another by Wolfgang followed. That was the Parsifal history for some 50 years.Schlingenseif’s production in 2004 threw out story and tradition, removed any remnants of Christianity and replaced them with the cult of a dead rabbit. This was almost universally condemned and was replaced by Stefan Herheim’s current production in 2008. This did no violence to Wagner’s opera and was hailed with relief by most critics and audience.Now, however, there are more changes which result in muddle. First and second acts are sex-orientated and it is noticeable that whereas the attempt to seduce Parsifal was originally only by the flower maidens and, of course, Kundry, now child rape is suggested – Kundry is disguised as Klingsor when she attempts to win the young Parsifal.But, strangest of all, Herheim’s third act is traditional, powerful and moving. Here is the group of Parsifal, Gurnemanz and Kundry. The singers are outstanding – Kwangchul Youn a magnificent Gurnemanz, Christopher Ventris as Parsifal and the seductive Mihoko Fujimura as Kendry. It is worth enduring the muddle of Acts I and II for the glories of the last one.

The opening of Das Rheingold is perhaps the very best way to experience Bayreuth’s wonderful acoustics, for the first time, and when Christian Thielemann conducts, this experience is nearly perfect.This Ring, directed by Tankard Dorst, was first seen in 2006 and some of it gets better each year. It is not perfect, but what is? But it is effective and, in general, true to Wagner. Neither Dorst nor his colleague Ursula Ehler – responsible for the revivals – have tried to impose a new interpretation on the whole.Scene designer Frank Philipp Schlossmann and Bernd Ernst Skodzig (costumes) have adopted the most successful semi-classical style – steps, pillars, arches. All gods wear white.Rheingold introduces the drama of the whole Ring. The story unfolds partly through the action of the opera, partly recounted by the players, and the success of the performance depends on the two central characters, Woton, chief of the gods, and Loge the fire spirit, who is neither god nor human, but plays a mocking part in the events. Albert Dohme, usually a promising Woton, was not in good voice here – the tone was harsh and gravely – but Arnold Bezyeun is a brilliant Loge by any standard. The two giants Fasolt and Fafner were well sung by Kwangchul Youn and Ain Anger. Andrew Shore repeats his very effective Alberich and all the others were more than adequate.

By this they made a number of difficulties for themselves which are not solved.The most obvious is Mime’s forge. A few bangs and flashing lights behind the counter have no dramatic effect, and when Siegfried has finally re-made the magic sword he can not split the anvil at one blow. A globe of the world is no substitute.However, there are some fine musical moments. Christian Thielemann continues his inspired conducting, and if the orchestra is sometimes overloud, it fully supports the singers. In general the singing is good but not great. The new Siegfried, Christian Franz, has a fine voice but a long way to go before he can deliver a convincinghero, and the long and demanding scene when he awakens Brunnhilde needs a great deal more rehearsal. Linda Watson’s Brunnhilde is effective but rather too mature, and sometimes too passionate for beauty.Other roles are well sung – Albert Dohmen as the wanderer (Wotan) just lacks a little more authority. Wolfgang Schmidt is an excellent Mime. It is a great pity that the scene between the Wanderer and Erda (Christa Mayer) is simply played in front of a curtain because it is a very important scene. At least it is well sung.

The three wise daughters of Erda, sung by Simone Schroder, Martina Dike and Edith Haller wear long graceful robes in black and silver. They sit together on a rock and behind is a black night sky full of twinkling stars. No more, but that is enough when Christian Thielemann and the orchestra unfold the mystery of the music, and the Norns sing so well.After this, unfortunately, things begin to go wrong. Seigfried (Christian Franz) and Brunnhilde (Linda Watson) wander about in the ruined castle where he awoke her in Siegfried. She is hampered by a dull, matronly costume and he – here and throughout the rest of the opera – appears to have lacked any kind of dramatic guidance.Much the same is true of the Gibichungs Hall. This is a handsome stately residence, or is it a hotel, or a large, superior brothel?We meet Hagen, magnificently sung by Hans-Peter Konig, but he does not convey the character’s evil. Ralf Lukas is a suitably weak Gunther and Haller a particularly good Gurtrune.The second act loses all its force and drama when the vassals are guests or staff, all in evening suits and boiled shirts. Siegfried becomes a puzzled, bad-tempered young man. Linda Watson has Wagnerian attack in her singing but tends to force her voice to some very ugly sounds.The ending was sad. Red light consuming the building. No Rhine, no Rhinemaidens to treasure the return of the ring.What a pity.

Hunding’s hut for the first scene of Walkure has become a simplified baronial hall, and the famous tree from which Seigmund will draw the magic sword is a felled trunk which has fallen in through a window. But these are matters of no importance. The setting fits the events.Here the exhausted Seigmund in the person of Endrik Wottrich staggers through another window. He is now much more at ease in this role – not great but acceptable. His Sieglinde is Eva-Maria Westbroek, attractive, passionate but rather shrill in excited moments. The star of this act is Kwangchul Youn as the rough, masterful Hunding.After this, the second and third acts reveal the essence of the story, and the singers excel. Linda Watson in exceptionally good voice is a powerfully dramatic Brunnhilde, and Albert Dohmen a profoundly moving Wotan, the god with a human heart.The last act is played in a ruined castle, a very effective setting, the eight valkyries in their scarlet caps and tunics make a vivid moving picture and sing splendidly. As all opera-goers know, there are moments when a good average performance suddenly becomes great one. The last act of the Walkure had that transformation. A Wotan and Brunnhilde to be long remembered.

Then she was the younger daughter of Wolfgang, grandson of the composer and brilliant director of the festivals for more than 40 years. Now he has retired and Katharina is joint festival director with her half-sister Eva Wagner-Pasquier.This production was provocative when first seen and it is still provocative today. Only, as often happens with a new ‘shocking’ approach, it is less provocative and more boring. This is Wagner’s only real comedy and there are delightfully funny episodes, some of which are now lost. For example, Beckmesser does not now steal the words of Stolzing’s prize song – for the simple reason that Hans Sachs does not write them down. The main differences are in the interpretation of characters.Hans Sachs is down-graded to an amiable onlooker. There is no street scene, no festival meadows for the St John’s Day merrymaking. Long ago when Weiland Wagner’s first Meistersinger was staged in 1956 with no houses, the production was nicknamed Die Meistersinger ohne Nurnberg – Mastersingers without Nuremberg. This is the same.There remains the music and there is much to praise. Robert Holl, (replacing the indisposed Alan Titus) used his beautiful voice with great intelligence, giving more to the character than it had in the past two years. Adrain Erod’s Beckmesser and Klaus Florian Vogt’s Stolzing were both well sung. Michaela Kaune’s Eva and most of the others, and Sebastian Weigle’s conducting were all adequate and within the production’s interpretation.

This year marks its third revival and the gloves are still on Isolde’s hands, though attention is now called to them when Tristan pulls them off in his discrete love making.The gloves may seem a small thing, but this is indicative of Christof Marthaler’s whole production. Presumably he decided to give opera a more or less modern setting with costumes (Anna Viebrook) to show it might happen today. But frankly it could not, the passions, agony, tragedy of the Irish princess and the Cornish nobleman could not be experienced in 20th-century suburbia. Did Marthaler really listen to the music? It would reveal Wagner’s extra dimension.Happily the musical side of the performance redeemed it to some extent. Peter Schneider conducted with real feeling for the score and the prelude to the first act stole upon the ear with the magic of Bayreuth’s amazing acoustics. Robert Dean Smith is now a fine Tristan with a really beautiful voice. Dramatically he is not great, but he gives an impressionable performance, particularly in the agonies of the last act. Irene Theorin’s Isolde is not yet very good. She and Brangane (Michelle Breedt) had something of a shouting match in the first act, but both recovered and sang with beauty later. Robert Holl made a moving King Marke, his magnificent bass nobly used. Some of the most beautiful singing came from Clemens Bieber’s Young Seaman at the beginning.

It’s an exciting, laudable and sometimes hazardous concoction.In an evening featuring a triple bill, the first performance sees celebrated mezzo-soprano Sally Burgess turn director in the promising first act of Ula.The action is the story of the successful director Adam’s new autobiographical film, recounted in flashback. Visiting the Scottish Highlands to recover from the tragic death of his wife, Adam runs into a storm and is taken in by a hospitable crofter, whose daughter Ula has a compellingly mysterious quality. By the end of the act, Adam has followed Ula to the craggy coast and she has – perhaps too quickly, and seemingly against the nature of her complex character – fallen in love with him.Mark Glenworth’s music (to words by Carolyn Herail) is suitably austere and often powerfully understated. Although the video dream sequence is a touch crude, there’s plenty of scope here, not least in a satisfying role for the crofter – richly sung and warmly acted by Mark Richardson.Another work in progress is Shadowplays, devised and directed by Roswitha Gerlitz, with music by Catherine Kontz. Combining real characters and their (filmed, projected) shadow counterparts with keen dramatic purpose, this amounts to a compelling, if elliptical, insight into the nature of male and female fantasies, and the completeness (or otherwise) of the reality of being.Part installation, part performance, Nicholas Brown’s As I Have Now Memoyre seeks to explore a pupil-teacher relationship through the voice. It involves a backdrop of electronic music, an Elizabethan singing teacher and her pupil (dressed in a white jump suit), who writes up her notes on the elements of singing on a large plastic screen. When the teacher leaves the performance space, we see her via a video monitor, relaxing in the dressing room. The work appears as a random succession of incidents and, although atmospheric, is as unrelenting as it is pretentious and unrevealing.

That Nikolaus Lehnhoff’s production retains its allure is down to the set design of Roland Aeschlimann as lit by Robin Carter.Eschewing the post-modern clutter endemic to recent Wagner realisations, the action takes place in and around a sort of transmogrified time tunnel, sixties TV-style. The grave beauty of the lighting is sufficient to banish any element of kitsch, transforming the concentric crescent space with lambent intimations of ship, dawn, womb and tomb.Andrea Schmidt-Futterer’s medieval costumes seldom get in the way, an exception being the Ku Klux Klansman attire of Andrew Kennedy’s Shepherd. The overall concept might work better were characters treated more consistently as dream-like archetypes without minutely signalled human emotions or incongruous humanising movement. The broader picture is certainly seductive enough. The chorus is never seen.Ecstatic and full-on, Anja Kampe fills the theatre with her big, rather coarse mezzo-ish sound, the Liebestod acquiring extra dramatic impact from the way her image fades finally into a pinpoint of light. Torsten Kerl’s Tristan, tired and nasal at times, keeps something in reserve for Act III. The Brangane is Sarah Connolly, a late stand-in whose focused tone, fine diction and concerned manner delight the Glyndebourne audience, although the voice lacks Wagnerian heft. There’s no lack of volume or gravitas in young Georg Zeppenfeld’s stoical King Marke.Right down to the casting of the smaller parts, this is notably youthful Wagner. Glyndebourne’s music director, Vladimir Jurowski (age 37) directs pungently and with fervour, often pushing forward where the music could breathe more but securing great depth of string tone at the start of the final act. A less iconic style of production might better complement his virile take on Wagner’s sound-world.

Orchestral playing is untidy in ensemble, often thrilling in execution. Gergiev’s conducting is fast and exciting, but needs more depth and architectural control.The staging looks half finished at times and desperately old-fashioned at others. Costumes are a motley collection, due to a concept that the Ring, like all myths, is universal, and can be visualised with elements from here, there and everywhere – although it loses focus and coherence in the process.Many of the individual performances lack real command, either vocal or dramatic. Larisa Gogolevskaya’s Brunnhilde struggles and nearly runs out of voice at times. Viktor Lutsyuk’s Siegfried has energy, intelligence and even some charm, but he is not real heldentenor material. Both Evgeny Nikitin’s Gunther and Elena Nebera’s Gutrune are presentable, although their oriental costumes look borrowed from another show.Two individuals add genuine distinction to this Gotterdammerung, and raise it to its highest level. One is Nikolai Putilin’s Alberich, vehement in delivery, grandly baleful in conception – he has provided the nearest thing the entire project has to a lynchpin and would grace any production. The other is his son, Hagen, sung by Mikhail Petrenko. Arguably a bigger, darker bass is really needed, but the intelligence of Petrenko’s acting shines through a Gotterdammerung that only hits the heights and depths sporadically and provides a very mixed showcase for the Mariinsky.

Costumes and even props continue to look haphazard, the worst so far being the bobbled woolly suit apportioned to Anastasia Kalagina’s Woodbird – not a character always visible on stage, anyway, as she traditionally sings ‘off’. She vocalises the role appealingly, but is hampered not only by her own visual presentation but by an unnecessary entourage who look like they have wandered in through the wrong stage door from The Lion King down the road at the Lyceum.That said, much of the first two acts goes reasonably well dramatically, aided by the respectable Mime of Vasily Gorshkov and the commanding Alberich of Nikolai Putilin, who provides the most solidly achieved interpretation of the cycle with his trenchant singing and intelligent acting. Evgeny Nikitin’s Wotan, Leonid Zakhozhaev’s Siegfried and Olga Sergeyeva’s Brunnhilde come and go in dramatic and vocal quality. None of them is really fully up to the task in a production visiting a major opera house and emanating from another one. And it just won’t do to have Brunnhilde getting into position on the rock where she’s supposedly slept for 20 years in full view of the audience.Orchestral playing is generally fine, although again needs more discipline and refinement. Valery Gergiev’s conducting is often exciting and sometimes more.

Mikhail Kit took over Wotan for Die Walkure, with Olga Savova coming in as the first of three sopranos to tackle the role of Brunnhilde in the cycle. Neither is vocally ideal, though both are along the right lines.Indeed, there’s a general feeling that most of the biggest assignments are being parcelled out to singers who are not 100% on top of the enormous vocal demands Wagner makes – both Avgust Amonov’s Siegmund and Mlada Khudoley’s Sieglinde are the odd decibel short of a Heldentenor and lyric-dramatic soprano respectively, creditable as they are. But Gennady Bezzubenkov’s Hunding is formidable, as is Larissa Diadkova’s Fricka, though her words are indecipherable.Conductor Valery Gergiev’s approach is piecemeal, homing in on exciting individual moments rather than supplying an ongoing architectural overview. The brass-heavy orchestra plays flat out for him.Visually, the show is less cluttered than Das Rheingold, but there’s still a lack of directorial focus. Some of the outlandish costumes, borrowing imagery from central Asian folk cultures and more widely afield, bring more mystery than enlightenment – though the overall set, with its vast images of crumbling god-like figures watching over the action, has a certain potency.

The latest to arrive is Alexander Zeldin, who does a reasonable job of presenting the main events and characters of Wagner’s drama, given that he is stuck with visuals that look like a random collection of religious objects from an ethnographical museum. What they all mean is anybody’s guess.The staging works best when keeping closest to the origins of Wagner’s epic in Germanic legend, though even here there are problems. Nikolai Putilin provides a grandly malevolent Alberich, but when cornered by Evgeny Nikitin’s underpowered Wotan and Oleg Balashov’s intelligent and frisky Loge in Nibelheim, his transformations into a dragon and a toad are feebly visualised.Some of the singing is under par. Evgeny Ulanov has a good baritone but Donner is too big for it. Even the normally wonderful Larissa Diadkova gets no text over as Fricka.But the giants are strong and Andrei Popov’s Mime memorably abject. Zlata Bulycheva’s Erda might make more impact if she did not look like a walking comb.The orchestral playing is strong. Gergiev takes an effectively speedy approach to Wagner, though his full concentration only seems to kick in round about halfway through.

Once again the cast, conductor and orchestra, together with the production team, hit all the right buttons. This Kat’a Kabanova is a triumph.Janacek is the Czech Puccini – a contemporary he much admired – and although his music is superficially spikier, its ardent lyricism conjures up the characters and emotional situations in this dark 19th-century Russian tale with the same kind of potent lyricism.Designer Yannis Thavoris moves the action forward to Janacek’s own period – the opera premiered in 1921 – and his spare sets suggest atmosphere wonderfully in Colin Grenfell’s lighting. Director Olivia Fuchs charts Katya’s downfall with sensitivity – only a few artificial hand-movements from the chorus strike a false note.The principal performances are unimpeachable. Anne Sophie Duprels rises marvellously to the challenge of the title role, with Tom Randle superb as her illicit lover, the visiting neighbour Boris, who ultimately leaves her to her fate. Jeffrey Lloyd Roberts presents a fine account of her weak, alcoholic husband Tichon, with Anne Mason duly terrifying as her daunting, unforgiving mother-in-law, Kabanicha.But it’s in the choral singing, the orchestral playing and in Stuart Stratford’s comprehensively excellent conducting that the show rises to pure greatness.Holland Park, London, July 24-August 7"

It can be warmly welcomed. Though Lez Brotherston’s otherwise traditional set looks as if half of it went missing on the way from the warehouse, what Arden does is to take the comedy seriously, allowing us a deeper engagement than usual with the shy peasant Nemorino and his initially one-sided affair with the sophisticated Adina, which only blossoms into full romance late in the day. It is a beautifully achieved piece of work.Outstanding too at this performance was the contribution of Spanish soprano Ainhoa Garmendia, who had flown in on the morning of the performance to take over from an ailing colleague in the leading role of Adina. Never less than confident in her singing or her acting, she meshed perfectly with her colleagues and the staging in an entirely remarkable piece of professionalism and savoir faire, saving the show with style.She is amongst a fine company. Peter Auty’s Nemorino is world-class in his vocal accomplishment and touching presentation of the character’s plight. Alfredo Daza sounds exactly the right notes of God’s gift to women bumptiousness and fundamental decency with his good-looking, healthy sounding Sergeant Belcore. Luciano Di Pasquale hits the spot as the fake potion seller Dulcamara, bringing colour and vivacity to his every appearance. The chorus are marvellous. Maurizio Benini maintains lively music-making in the pit.

But two singers to one role caused negligible confusion, compared to certain elements of Martin Lloyd-Evans’s new production.The character names swap between those of the opera’s Swedish and American versions (despite clearly being set in the USA), and the role of Oscar is de-trousered – a woman playing a woman (instead of a woman playing a man, although her character’s name oddly remains Oscar). The fortune-teller Ulrica has become the star of a reality TV show – cue a roving cameraman and boom operator – destroying the darkly atmospheric music of Act I, Scene II, and there’s a novel approach to chronology when the murderous Renato receives an invitation for that evening’s ball, while on the far side of the screen behind him, guests have been arriving for some time. But the broad setting within the White House, and Act II’s gallows scene – transferred to a rundown, hoodie-infested alley – hold some appeal.Peter Robinson’s direction of the City of London Sinfonia is solid but unexciting, but David Rendall gives a remarkably assured performance given the circumstances. Olafur Sigurdarson as the loyal-turned-murderous Renato gives his all but occasionally sounds tired. The highlight of the production is Amanda Echalaz’s Amelia. Hers is a tangibly powerful voice, capable of wide-ranging emotions – something the production as a whole has a habit of smothering.

While the piece also inevitably has echoes of Norma Desmond hoping for a return to the movies, Wainwright’s tender, heartfelt score is nothing like Lloyd Webber’s lushly opera-lite Sunset Boulevard, but a serious, rigorous exploration of tone and character.There are just six here – besides the diva, these include her new maid Marie and her long-serving butler Philippe, and a journalist, Andre, who comes to interview her. Even if the libretto, co-written by Wainwright with Bernadette Colomine, doesn’t provide the strongest dramatic impetus, it is the music which matters here, and Wainwright’s gorgeous melodies are given full vocal reign, particularly by Janis Kelly’s Regine and Rebecca Bottone’s luminous Marie. William Joyner’s Andre is virtually pushed into counter-tenor range as the journalist, and struggles a little.Director Daniel Kramer, whose recent work has included such showy productions as Birtwistle’s Punch and Judy for ENO and Pictures from an Exhibition, co-produced by Sadlers’ Wells and the Young Vic, exhibits admirable restraint in providing a production that, instead of being saturated in effects, is merely effective. Stunningly designed by Antony McDonald and lit by Peter Mumford, this is a new opera that pays tribute to the past while pushing the form into the future.

Its latest revival, directed by Stephen Barlow, both roots its strengths and highlights its shortcomings.The architectural settings of Acts I and III may be less impressive than Zeffirelli’s, but the two-tier design for Rome’s Sant’Andrea della Valle Church deftly places the choir’s Te Deum above, while Scarpia remains the focus below. The Act III setting of the Castel Sant’ Angelo is rather more abstract though strongly effective, with a low level sweeping battlement. But this modernised setting has lured Kent into allowing a huge feathered wing to loom overhead – a symbol perhaps of the freedom Tosca and Cavaradossi hope to share, even if that has to be in death. More successfully, it’s telling that in Scarpia’s grand apartment in Act II, the only books on his floor to ceiling shelves are those fronting a false door leading to his torture chamber.There’s a touch of hammy melodrama in Angela Gheorgiu’s acting in the title role, and even in that of Bryn Terfel’s Scarpia, although both are on top form vocally, and Terfel retains his trademark magnetic physical presence. Marcello Giordani pushes out some searing top notes as Cavaradossi – but his heroic voice lacks colouring and lyricism, despite a winning E lucevan le stelle, which the audience was strangely hesitant to applaud.Young Canadian conductor Jacques Lacombe, making his Royal Opera debut, doesn’t always keep up with the swift changes of characterisation in the score, but brings a good measure of its scale and drama. On first night, the whole production didn’t quite leap off the stage, leading to a highly respectable performance, but one ultimately lacking in believable passion.

The first half, subtitled ‘Theatre of Melancholy’, consists of Birtwistle’s arrangements of six songs by the Elizabethan lutenist-composer John Dowland, whose words and music reflect the deep melancholy referred to in the title – his own motto. Birtwistle plays these straight, with Helen Tunstall’s harp accompaniment replacing the lute and tenor Mark Padmore articulating the texts with a discrete intensity. Around these are placed Birtwistle’s arrangements of Dowland’s Seaven Teares Figured in Seaven Passionate Pavanes, originally written for viol consort. Birtwistle starts by emulating the sound of viols then gradually adds in more instrumental colours. With some subtle dancing by Helka Kaski and Thom Rackett, Peter Gill’s staging adds a non-intrusively apt theatrical dimension.The second piece, The Corridor, is more obviously dramatic and revisits a constant theme for Birtwistle – that of the ancient story of Orpheus and Eurydice. Padmore sings Orpheus in this complex examination of the moment when Orpheus looks back at the wife he has visited Hades to bring back to life, while Elizabeth Atherton is the uncertain, twice-lost Eurydice. It’s a richly detailed piece, with David Harsent’s libretto encompassing several layers of meaning that Birtwistle’s score – immaculately played here by the London Sinfonietta under Ryan Wigglesworth – explores further. Once again Gill’s staging keeps things simple within Alison Chitty’s minimal designs. It’s a rewarding evening.

And deservedly so, for it is one of the richest of late-Romantic scores,Dvorak’s evocative native Czech folk idioms blend with a distinctive Wagnerian undertow in a piece as passionate as it is entrancing. It sounds wonderful with the London Philharmonic conducted by Jiri Belohlavek.In what is her debut as an opera director, Melly Still explores the dark recesses at the heart of this tale, combining elements of traditional and constructed fairy tales (Hans Christian Andersen’s The Little Mermaid lies in its background).Designer Rae Smith is aided by Paule Constable’s lighting in setting up the atmosphere of the forest lake where water nymph Rusalka meets her handsome prince, as well as the sophistication of the Prince’s court where their love affair falls spectacularly apart. Some of Rick Nodine’s movement, however, particularly with extras dressed like black Teletubbies carrying characters on and off, gets in the way.But nothing detracts from the strong team of central performances, with Ana Maria Martinez expressively potent as the tragic heroine, Brandon Jovanovich a distinguished Prince, and Mischa Schelomianski ominously foretelling doom as Rusalka’s father and engrossing even in his Fungus the Bogeyman costume. Larissa Diadkova is a gleeful witch, Tatiana Pavlovskaya a flashy foreign Princess. It’s a deeply moving experience.

But they’ve allowed their regular set and costume designers, Christian Fenouillat and Agostino Cavalca, to somewhat hijack the production.The pastel box-set of Bartolo’s sparsely furnished home features concealed doors – a sharp comment on his ward Rosina’s trapped isolation. But that message hardly hits home when the coloured vertical lines, already fairly crude, jumble into a kind of animated Bridget Riley, as the whole set lifts and tilts, reflecting the ensemble’s confusion in the Act 1 finale. It’s a mechanical miracle better left to the fairground.With some garish costumes – Figaro looks alarmingly Smurf-like, Almaviva is swamped in frills and bright colours, the policemen have plastic white helmets and black PVC capes – and the heart-shaped balloons at the end, the campness is gratuitous.Thankfully Pietro Spagnoli is a can-do, life-loving Figaro, Joyce DiDonato is a spittingly feisty Rosina and Juan Diego Florez amuses in Almaviva’s cameos as drunken soldier and obsequious singing teacher. Alessandro Corbelli’s Bartolo is simply a marvel of comic acting and Feruccio Furlanetto is a skin-crawlingly oily Don Basilio who gains almost sexual pleasure from his plans to slander Almaviva. The singing all round easily meets the high expectations created by such a top-flight cast, with the applause following DiDonato’s Una Voce Poco Fa, exceeded only by the audience eruption after Florez’s Cessare Di Piu Resistere. Shortly after the former, DiDonato slipped and hurt her right leg. Although she gallantly continued her performance (many were unaware of the injury), she returned after the interval on a crutch. It was announced she had sprained her ankle, although it turns out she broke the fibula of her right leg. Perhaps by completing the performance, she was reflecting Rosina’s steely resolve, but certainly DiDonato suddenly found herself playing two heroines at once.

ENO’s staging, its first in the UK, is by new wave circus director Daniele Finzi Pasca, best known for his work with Cirque du Soleil, to strikingly evocative designs by Jean Rabasse and Kevin Pollard.The piece itself focuses on just two characters. Jaufre Rudel is a medieval French troubadour who falls in love with the idea of a countess in far-off Tripoli, and she, Clemence, with him. Bringing them news of each other is the Pilgrim, who also accompanies Jaufre on his eventual trip to meet his distant lover, only to see him expire as he reaches her arms. It’s a simple symbolic tale of a love whose perfection lies in its unreality.In its hazy, insubstantial way, Saariaho’s lavishly coloured score is undeniably beautiful and delivered with some magic by ENO’s orchestra under Edward Gardner. Pasca’s production is a riot of movement and colour, using gorgeous costumes, video, acrobatics and flying to create an atmosphere of fantasy that disguises the paucity of solid material in the piece. There are fine central performances from Roderick Williams’ purposeful Jaufre, Joan Rodgers’ Clemence and Faith Sherman’s Pilgrim. It’s an evening of genuine beauty, visual and musical – though arguably there’s more on the surface than lies beneath.

It says much for the energy and focus of Tom Hawkes’ staging that once past a slow opening scene, it picks up momentum and maintains its pace. Oddly, the main barrier is the notion that we’re in a film studio, and that the show is being directed by an Erich von Stroheim figure. Greek mythology is enough to be getting on with.But at least the Hollywood frame gives designer Peter Rice plenty of ammunition for his sets and costumes, which are a riot of invention and good fun. So are many of the individual performances, although a general fault is a lack of kick in the dialogue, which needs punching harder over the footlights. But Jeni Bern’s nimble Eurydice, Benjamin Segal’s raffish Orpheus, Ian Caddy’s scurrilous Jupiter (wonderfully seconded by Jill Pert’s expert Juno) and Daniel Broad’s Aristaeus turning into Pluto all give good value. Nuala Willis’s grandly overbearing Public Opinion is also spot-on.Jenny Weston’s choreography has plenty of pep and the evening’s feel-good factor is high.

Dispensing with any specific sense of period, let alone the confined artists’ garret in which Mimi and Rodolfo traditionally fall in love, the wide but shallow performing space at Holland Park is dominated by a huge piece of Marcello’s artwork, blood red and indicative of passions to come. The Cafe Momus is evoked in ingenious fashion with Marcello’s canvas pulled off its scaffolding to reveal, mounted beneath, the cafe’s illuminated sign. While the stage looks over-stuffed in Act II and the scaled-down orchestra is over-driven and over-loud much of the time, the essential dramatic ground is covered effectively and economically.Linda Richardson, a veteran Mimi whose statuesque look and vibrant tones are not perhaps intended to convey vulnerability, is more professional than affecting until her final illness. Her main difficulty is that she is costumed in unbecoming forties style. In the A cast, Rodolfo and Marcello are taken by Australians, both experienced exponents of these roles, despite their youth. Aldo di Toro, short on power, sings with sincerity. His top notes ring out with clarity, the timbre as vibrantly Italian as the name suggests. Grant Doyle, a recent member of the Royal Opera Young Artists programme, makes a personable Marcello. Hye-Youn Lee, his feisty, scene-stealing Musetta, survives a few squally moments, her characterisation enhanced by her dress, a racy red number. Njabulo Madlala’s Schaunard, less sartorially challenged than his mates, is outshone by Tim Mirfin’s resonant Colline. Odd that he should be the one to sacrifice a beloved old coat when it is Schaunard who has the more remarkable outer garment.The sense of community is certainly stronger than in bigger budget productions performed indoors, but too few tears are shed.

Then it muddies the waters further by moving the situation to the aftermath of the American Civil War. Sweden certainly makes better sense.In any case, the show is visually undistinguished until a spectacular finale in which mirrors open out the ball scene to impressive effect. Elsewhere, there’s too much weak and aimless direction and a general retreat towards old-style operatic wandering about.Three of the principals suffer from this, and though they all have grand voices, none of them delivers a truly purposeful performance. Dalibor Jenis’ Renato also lacks solid low notes, while Angela Marambio’s Amelia is not always in control of her enormous soprano. As the witch Ulrica, Elena Manistina makes a darkly opulent sound but her acting is rudimentary.Two of their colleagues fare better. Though she lacks the final touch of sparkle, Anna Christy’s Oscar is delightfully sung and acted. As the doomed, light-hearted Riccardo, Ramon Vargas has clearly thought about the meaning of every note and is outstanding.Conductor Maurizio Benini offers a level of decent routine, but not much more.

Meanwhile she herself ignores the sincere attentions of her servant Fabrizio. Add in a couple of visiting actresses and you have the recipe for a straightforward opera buffa along classic lines.The score is the mid 20th century equivalent to similar works by Rossini or Mozart – spicy, in constant motion, and brilliantly entertaining. A slightly unruly overture apart, it goes with a bang at Garsington under conductor Martin Andre.So does Martin Duncan’s staging, sung in Jeremy Sams’ tiptop translation. And the company is first rate, led by Juanita Lascarro’s smart, seductive Mirandolina, Geoffrey Dolton’s Ripafratta – a tour de force of sustained comic brilliance – and with neatly engineered performances from the rest of an impeccable cast. This is the first UK production of a genuine comic masterpiece. Don’t miss it.

With Renee Fleming as the fun-loving but consumptive Violetta, Maltese tenor Joseph Calleja singing her lover Alfredo Germont and Thomas Hampson in the role of Alfredo’s domineering father Giorgio, we are treated to three of international opera’s hottest properties.So it is no surprise that the singing often sets the heart racing. Fleming is utterly vivacious in her Act I party, suitably dramatic in the next act when called upon by Giorgio to renounce her love for Alfredo, and touchingly wasting as she succumbs to her condition in Act III. While some opera stars are happy to rest on their laurels, Fleming works hard to ensure the voice is as much a dramatic tool as a musical one. Calleja perhaps overpowers her in their duets – his ringing Italianate tone exuding an intense power to thrill – although just occasionally one wishes for a more sophisticated control of the colour.Hampson also fulfils the high expectations of his singing, exuding a rich, burnished and unfailingly elegant sound, but he presents a somewhat melodramatic, whimpering Giorgio, out of line with the character’s demanding nature. Completing this powerhouse revival is Covent Garden’s musical director Antonio Pappano, who takes none of this familiar score for granted, constantly rekindling it with love and fascination.

The biggest commemoration of the year comes courtesy of Glyndebourne, which stages one of his last and grandest works, first presented in London in 1692.The form of the piece – semi-opera – is usually written off as intractable. It’s half play, half sung and danced masque. In this instance, the play is a cut-down adaptation of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, with lengthy musical sequences placed at the ends of the acts. Directors and conductors have fought shy of it for decades, often junking the spoken text altogether and leaving the songs, dances and choruses stranded without context.The first decision director Jonathan Kent and Baroque specialist conductor William Christie – here in charge of the period-instrument Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment – get right is the do the lot, bar a bit of judicious editing. It works better than anyone could have imagined, with a first-rate team of actors led by Sally Dexter’s Titania, Joseph Millson’s Oberon and Desmond Barrit’s Bottom, an equally fine ensemble of singers, plus a troupe of dancers executing Kim Brandstrup’s steps. It’s a superb company achievement.Paul Brown’s designs keep on coming up with brilliant ideas in a staging that never flags for a moment.

It focuses on the young Vixen herself, vividly personified by Ailish Tynan, a sparky presence in every scene. Presented visually as the composer himself is Robert Poulton’s Forester, his rich baritone and sentient performance shaping the spiritual trajectory of a man who increasingly realises the interdependence of all creation and the transience of living things.There’s strong support from Frances Bourne’s Fox – jauntily propositioning the Vixen before marrying her at the joyous end of Act 2 – and David Stout’s confidently brutal Harasta, the poacher encroaching upon and destroying the natural world.Alden’s staging is lively and entertaining, making a good deal of such set pieces as the Vixen tricking and then despatching the fatuous Cock and his giddy gaggle of hens. Gideon Davey’s set is a large room gradually invaded by the forest creatures, which interact with the human characters. Wynne Evans and Timothy Dawkins are among four singers who double up as both human and animal. Much of it is delightful, despite the folk dancing becoming intrusive.Conductor Andre de Ridder maintains strong momentum, though the orchestra is a touch fuzzy around the edges.

They all lived, not so happily as it happened, with their amusingly bumbling patriarch, Don Magnifico (Henry Waddington), in a caravan – proving that the family was truly no more than trailer trash.A clever director called Daniel Slater decided that the Prince Ramiro’s tutor, Alidoro, would be cast as a film director searching for a leading lady to play out the rest of her days as the Prince’s wife. This meant the chorus could pretend to be paparazzi interviewing the film stars, which was nice.It also meant that a trio of Paris Hilton lookalike dancers with awesome legs could audition for the female lead, alongside the chavette sisters (who wore, OMG, like the grossest clashing bright tops with their tight black leggings). No wonder they bombed.Cinderella was sung by Ezgi Kutlu, who mostly looked really sad (even when she arrived at the ball looking gorgeous), but her voice was a bit like an athlete and a gymnast rolled into one, and never got tired (unlike her love interest Prince Ramiro, sung by Antonis Koroneos). As Ramiro’s valet Dandidi, Quirijn de Lang looked as if he belonged on a film set, and sounded as hot as he looked. More incredibly, Joshua Bloom (the tutor Alidoro) had a gushing voice that some would say you only get in a land of make-believe.One of England’s unrecognised dukes of opera, David Parry, whipped up the orchestra with his magic wand and, not surprisingly, the audience left the beautiful manor and gardens of Garsington happily ever after.

As the action unfolds in her mother’s apartment, she explains how a falling angel, Bruno, tells her incredulous mother to be of her arrival. Part of the work’s unsatisfying nature lies in its focus on the Annunciation, with little exploration of the relationships between the mother (Kristel) and Bruno, or indeed between Kristel and her daughter – who after all have a phenomenal biological connection.Although well written for the voices, and fervently sung by Amy Freston (Kristel) and Stephan Loges (Bruno), some of the text is rendered unintelligible, and MacMillan’s conducting tends to allow the his heavily gesture-driven ensemble writing – inventively coloured though it is – to mask the singers. Vicki Mortimer’s detailed and atmospheric sets, along with Gareth Fry’s sound design, create a psychological back drop which is under-exploited.The piece may prove to repay the effort of a repeat hearing, but on first contact, Parthenogensis, like the story on which it is based, seems as improbable as an immaculate conception.

Perhaps surprisingly, Minghella with his set designer Michael Levine resisted the temptation to recreate the opera’s turn of the 20th-century Nagasaki setting with lovingly detailed Japonaiserie. Instead we have a proliferation of plain sliding panels, bold, single-coloured backdrops and sliding panels. An overhead floating mirror offers another angle on the events, sometimes a sense of distance, sometimes a hidden view, but rarely, in fact, much of significance.Drawing influence especially from Japanese bunraku puppet theatre, there is much visual intervention of jet black-dressed puppeteers, who choreograph globe lanterns during Pinkerton’s night under the stars with Butterfly, and wear blossom-jackets, plucked by Butterfly to decorate her home for what she thinks is Pinkerton’s homecoming. More controversially Butterfly’s three-year-old son is played by an expressive and quite magical puppet figure. There’s also a dream ballet in which a Butterfly puppet and male dancer act out Butterfly’s desperate path of love, rejection and death.The visual feast, though, tends to distract from the emotional substance of the story, an impression not helped in this particular context by Brian Hymel’s portrayal of Pinkerton as something of a damp squib. With his voice tightening in its upper extremities, he was the only weak link in a very strong cast featuring Judith Howarth’s richly lyrical Butterfly, Christine Rice’s faithful Suzuki and Brian Mulligan’s avuncular Sharpless. Edward Gardner wrings less colour from the score than expected, but creates a number of searingly powerful climaxes.

The set is a black box with some screens in front, the characters are uniformly dressed in black, and where Berg designed an interlude to be accompanied by a film at the halfway point, there’s nothing of the kind. On this level, it is a frank disappointment.But there’s some serious purpose here, even if the approach is lacking in visual appeal and – even more basically – theatricality. This is more of a didactic commentary on the piece than an exposition of it. That some of the performances register impressively, nevertheless, is partly due to the quality of the artists involved, but mainly to the amazing musicianship and sheer expressive power that pumps through every bar of Antonio Pappano’s conducting and the superb playing of the orchestra. The fascination and beauty of the score shines through as much as its modernist orientation.But two big interpretations – Agneta Eichenholz’s ordinary Lulu and Michael Volle’s dull Dr Schon – impede the show with their flat-footed mundanity. It is left to Jennifer Larmore’s involving Geschwitz, Will Hartmann’s three characters (especially his Painter), Philip Langridge’s trio of comprimarios and Gwynne Howell’s Schigolch, to paint in some essential drama. We get part of the way with one of the great 20th-century masterpieces, but not really far enough.

It is also hampered by Peter Selwyn’s conducting, which suffers from a fatal lack of momentum and his covering of the voices, notably the two leads.Catherine Hopper’s Hansel and Joana Seara’s Gretel are nevertheless charmingly sung and convincingly childlike, forming a credibly engaging brother and sister act. Donald Maxwell fields a presentably lived-in father and Anne Mason’s apparently respectable mother is strongly delivered. But other recent productions have pointed out a disfunctionality in the family that would have these kids in care before you can say bedtime.Mason is less happy as the Witch, where her semi-glam pantomime dame is harmless yet also charmless. To Paul Edwards’s designs, Stephen Barlow’s staging contains some odd reminders of the First World War, with gas masks, a soldier Sandman and a field nurse Dew Fairy – although these references are thrown in rather than explored. The rest of the show aims for the pretty end of the market. It’s at best a fragmentary vision of a surprisingly complex piece.

The hedonistic sun-worshipping emperor is ultimately killed by his own henchmen, dragged through the streets of Rome and tossed into the Tiber.David Fielding’s UK premiere production for Grange Park Opera plays up the opera’s themes of sex and violence. The emperor’s valet Nerbulone arrives as the biker from Village People, his newly formed all-female senate comprises pole-dancing Playboy bunny-girls and his servant Zotico is styled (unconvincingly) in the versatile dual role of boyfriend and pimp.Lenia, the emperor’s servant in drag, is a mutton dressed as lamb nurse in a skimpy Clinique-girl’s uniform, and the gladiator Tiferne, clad in buckled leathers, could be the main attraction at an S&M club. It’s a titillating evening, but, save for adding a layer of gender-bending by casting the emperor as a woman (it would originally have been a male castrato), there’s little depth or darkness to the depravity. The violence, though well executed, is far-fetched, resulting in an overall impression of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert meets Reservoir Dogs.The cast is mostly very strong, even if Renata Pokupic is physically slight for the emperor. Sinead Campbell-White (Gemmira), Claire Booth (Eritea) and Yvette Bonner (Atilia) are vocally impressive, Tom Walker drags up well as Lenia and Julia Riley adds a quiet vein of stoicism as the emperor’s cousin Alessandro. Driven by Christian Curnyn’s period-instrument Early Opera Company orchestra, the performance is a musical treat.

Concerning the release of the unjustly imprisoned Florestan by his wife Leonora – who has infiltrated the prison disguised as a (male) warder – the opera is so allegorical, based as it is on the subjects of love, fidelity, hope, justice and liberation – that John Cox’s boldly sober staging suits the piece well. Cox is unafraid to display an empty stage during the Overture, or to have his cast sing arias – heaven forbid – simply facing the audience.The metal scaffold of Gary McCann’s design is almost underused and three simple concrete circles form the cistern covers to the prisoners down below. As is their gift and wont at Garsington, the adjacent parterre garden is used as an extension of the stage, at the end of Act I, when the prisoners are released to take the air.The singing and playing is of high quality. Rebecca von Lipinski sings the heroine Leonora with resolve and a suitably resolute upper range, while Claire Ormshaw as Marzelline adds a naivety to her attractively rich instrument. Frode Olsen began uneasily as the jailer Rocco, but warmed into his role, revealing a humane core beneath the Governor’s yes-man. Sergei Leiferkus is luxuriously cast as the Governor Don Pizaaro, while Paul Putnins impressed less as the King’s Minister. Douglas Boyd draws some especially creamy woodwind playing from the Garsington Opera Orchestra and creates a satisfying sense of substance and purpose.

The range of technical skills required, plus its musical and dramatic demands, not to mention its sheer length, place it beyond the means of all but the most outstanding interpreters. It says much for the artistry of Claire Rutter that she assumes it so superbly in this opening production of Grange Park’s season. She has further exploration to do, but this already an exceptional portrayal.The remainder of the cast has strong elements. John Hudson is bold and forthright as her treacherous lover, Pollione. The Venezuelan bass Ernesto Morillo brings a superior voice and finely attuned acting skills to bear on Norma’s father, Oroveso. Sara Fulgoni looks tense and sounds a shade monochrome as Norma’s rival and later friend, Adalgisa, but she matches Rutter impressively in the great duets, while Stephen Barlow’s conducting seeks out all the passion and drive of the score.Martin Constantine’s production is an effective piece of work, if a little short on detail and mysterious in its presentation of the ancient Gallic Druids as a group of modern religious terrorists/freedom fighters operating against an elusive enemy. Yet the power of the piece hits home.

The plot details the rocky course of Elizabeth I’s infatuation with Robert Devereux, the Earl of Essex, which reached its historical conclusion with his execution in 1601. In Donizetti’s bel canto masterpiece, Elizabeth’s rival for Essex’s affections is Sara, Duchess of Nottingham, whose husband, the Duke, ensures that Essex is for the chop.Donizetti fleshes out the plot’s tensions with music that itself builds to a great final act. Designer Peter McKintosh has the benefit of a fragment of the original, near-contemporary Holland House to base his set upon. Costumes are period and glamorous. Director Lindsay Posner recreates a credible Elizabethan court before our eyes but focuses attention on the principals.Under leading bel canto expert Richard Bonynge, the score crackles throughout. Julian Hubbard’s vocally lightweight Duke needs more experience, but is along the right lines. Yvonne Howard charts the predicament of Sara with skill and security. Leonardo Capalbo cuts a dashing figure as Essex, rising to a moving prison scene. Leading the show is Majella Cullagh, a comprehensively fine Elizabeth, who conquers each and every flamboyant difficulty in the role and gives a riveting interpretation of the pressures that weigh upon a queen trying to balance political realities with her inner feelings and a jealous nature. The result is an outstanding evening and a fine beginning to London’s main summer opera season.

Apparently frustrated by the slowness of his UK visa application, the award-winning Iranian film director didn’t make it to London to rehearse this ENO version – instead his associate director, Elaine Tyler-Hall, who worked on the show in Aix, took charge.This unfortunate background should not colour views of the version at the Coliseum, but there is no disguising that the result is disappointing. Abbas’ designer Malika Chauveau’s vision of the piece is conventional and even old-fashioned, with the exception of some filmed projections setting visual backgrounds to the main action. Her classical-style set is handsome enough, but the films draw too much attention to themselves. The opening cafe scene, curiously, places a background with contemporary customers behind 18th century principals. There’s a pleasing panorama of a Mediterranean coastline, although the moving waves and clouds prove distracting. So too does the filmed orchestra playing more or less in synch with ENO’s orchestra in the final scene. None of this adds very much, and whoever has directed the principals misses innumerable tricks.The individual performances cannot save the show. Susan Gritton is a technically secure Fiordiligi, well matched by Fiona Murphy’s Dorabella. But neither Thomas Glenn’s Ferrando nor Liam Bonner’s Guglielmo justify their import. Sophie Bevan’s Despina and Steven Page’s Alfonso both pass muster, but Stefan Klingele’s conducting is tepid and superficial.

In the pit, music director Vladimir Jurowski presides over a precise and ebullient performance of this alternately delicate and rumbustious score, with its notoriously tricky ensembles. Here they are as clean as a new pin.To Ultz’s clever designs, Richard Jones’s production updates the action from the Tudor period to immediately post-war Windsor, with Turkish tenor Bulent Bezduz’s sweet-toned Fenton an American GI and Marie-Nicole Lemieux’s vivacious Mistress Quickly another uniformed member of the armed forces. Falstaff and his cronies hang out in the panelled bar of the dully respectable local inn, where a ginger cat forms part of the furniture. Much of the show is a sheer visual delight, though there’s a slight drop in momentum after the interval, with the nocturnal fairy reveries in Windsor Forest neither as clear nor as magical as they could be.But overall there’s an enormous amount to enjoy, notably in Christopher Purves’ game and savvy Falstaff. The voice may lack an ideal decaying richness of tone, but his acting performance is spot-on in its blend of rascality and epicurean delight in life’s pleasures. Vocally tensile and physically menacing, Tassis Christoyannis makes a formidable Ford, and there’s an impeccable set of merry wives, with Adriana Kucerova’s silvery-toned Nannetta matching Bezduz’s Fenton charm for charm.

After a successful revival in 2007, the show is back once more this season, and – dare I say it – even better than before.Robert Jones’ sets and Brigitte Reiffenstuel’s costumes remain a visual delight in their explorative mingling of elements of the ancient world with those of the British period in Egypt and the theatrical pizzazz of 18th-century opera seria. McVicar’s staging – surely his masterpiece thus far – combines observant comments on the workings of Imperialism (without a hint of sententiousness) with a brilliant observation of the characters and their complex network of relationships.Andrew George’s movement provides sheer entertainment that is simultaneously a revelation of how the political and emotional forces underlying the individual arias and the work’s overall dramatic trajectory can be articulated to their best advantage. Thought provoking and fun, this is operatic staging at its best.Marvellous too are the playing of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, under spirited conductor Laurence Cummings, and all of the principal performances. New are Stephanie D’Oustrac’s thrillingly engaged Sesto and Guido Loconsolo’s dangerously sexual Achilla. Returning standouts include Rachid Ben Abdeslam’s witty Nireno, Patricia Bardon’s noble Cornelia, Sarah Connolly’s sensitive but manly Caesar and Danielle de Niese’s riveting all-singing, all-dancing Cleopatra.

Classic Arabian Nights costumes mix with modern clothing and the sets are strikingly simple.The comedy is exuberant, dizzy and sometimes quite off the wall. Nadia Morgan is ideally cast as the Pasha’s Mute, setting the scene for each act. A running joke requiring, one hopes, little explanation. A final act chase sequence, with sound effect footfalls, has spot on pacing.Visual aspects of the first act do puzzle such as film clips of tanks projected on to parts of the scenery, model Hummers running along the stage and characters arranging unspecified small blocks. Sit behind a substantial person and you might miss something – was that really a little dog? It is best to relax, pick up what you can and follow the letters. Knowing who wrote what, and why, will help.Allan Clayton’s Belmonte sings of his love for Constanze with pleasing melancholy. Kate Valentine as Constanze, held captive by the Pasha, sings with convincing emotion but is less assured with dialogue. Indeed, there are some flat spots when she and the Pasha (Martin Hyder) are together.Elena Xanthoudakis is a revelation as Blonde, the feisty servant to Constanze. Her second act ding-dong with Osmin, the Pasha’s obstructive servant (Clive Bayley), is furious comic fun. Later we see her dressed as Wonder Woman, for a fancy dress celebration.

The show has some sharp and attractive visuals, though the vast pyramid of bales of straw at curtain-up requires an unnecessary scene change. The vision of Ozzie the non-singing dog running across the stage gets a laugh, but it’s a low and completely unnecessary shot.The central performances are generally strong, though, with some fine singing on display. Anthony Michaels-Moore is a bit rough lower down these days, and the bumptiousness of his Sergeant Belcore is apt to wear an unfortunate air of arrogance. Simone Alaimo offers the evening’s most complete realisation, with his grand and vivid voice and an ability to connect with the audience as the quack Dr Dulcamara.Both Giuseppe Filianoti’s Nemorino and Diana Damrau’s Adina offer much pleasure. She’s a tip-top coloratura, even though the colour of her free and easy soprano lacks Italianate warmth and dramatically she’s on the brittle side at the start. Filianoti’s strong lyric tenor has a hint of a metallic edge to it but he’s an exceptionally charming exponent of the hapless lovelorn peasant and his performance of the famous aria Una furtiva lagrima is something special.Strong ensemble work from the chorus, with some keenly etched individual sketches enlivening the show.

There is greatness in the evening, much of it stemming from the pit, where Edward Gardner presides over a vividly intense account of the score, drawing the finest playing from ENO’s orchestra and wonderful work from the expanded chorus.Alden’s staging is less sure-footed. In Paul Steinberg’s sets and Brigitte Reiffenstuel’s costumes the period is presumably around the time of the opera’s creation – it was premiered by ENO’s parent company at Sadler’s Wells in 1945 – though the visuals lack a strong sense of an English fishing village. The outside scenes are undistinguished and even the local pub looks more like the drawing room of some louche local Bohemian, with Rebecca de Pont Davies’ landlady Auntie a hand me down version of Vita Sackville-West.Though the score has its expressionist moments – brilliantly articulated by Gardner – the drama’s mode is realistic and communal hand gestures look wildly out of place, as do the mysterious twin schoolgirl Nieces, who seem to have wandered in from The Shining.But there’s impressive vocal security from Stuart Skelton’s Grimes, even if the dramatic side of his creation is still a rough sketch. Gerald Finley provides a firm and incisive Balstrode, though his naval uniform indicates someone on active service rather than a retired sea-captain.

Here is text book Verdi, the emotional and dramatic essence of Don Carlos in a thoroughly apt staging.Scenes open with a square cut into a white screen to allow a first view of a main character. Then the full set is revealed. Hildegard Bechtler’s simple but telling design has towering walls and the lighting allows for emphatic shadows. The atmosphere in this clandestine world is oppressive, furtive, anything but sombre. Entrances and exits have strong visual impact, the burning of heretics is a nightmarish pageant, but  the stage does look too severely raked for comfort.Don Carlos loves Elisabeth. Once they were promised in marriage but now she is wed to his father, King Phillip II of Spain. Not a healthy situation, especially in a royal family. Julian Gavin is the agonising son, singing with perfectly expressed heartache.Jane Dutton, making her Opera North debut, excels as scheming Princess Eboli. Her aria in the fourth act is a soaring belter. Each word is purely sung. More of Ms Dutton, please.Both Clive Bayley, as the Grand Inquisitor, and Robert Winslade Anderson as the Monk sing with commendable power. The latter’s contribution being quite striking.Andrew Porter’s balanced and well toned translation enables the singing to seem almost as natural as talking.

In this version, Lohengrin’s Act III Narration is twice as long as usual, which can only be done given a tenor with the necessary resources to keep pumping out the tone at a late stage in a long evening. Fortunately Johan Botha’s Swan Knight meets such requirements, offering a performance in which his ample, silvery voice is never compromised. He’s also been cleverly costumed to present him to his best advantage.Edith Haller’s Elsa tires slightly, and her characterisation seems unduly passive for a visionary, yet the bulk of her performance presses the right vocal buttons. Genuinely exciting are the baddies – Petra Lang’s imperious Ortrud well-matched by Gerd Grochowski’s tensile Telramund – and the vital roles of King Heinrich and his Herald are secure in the empowered performances of Kwangchul Youn and Boaz Daniel.Making a welcome return to Covent Garden is conductor Semyon Bychkov, whose expansive, finely-balanced reading brings the grand climaxes swinging clearly into view and whose comprehensive articulation of the score allows the individual acts to unfold in vast paragraphs.

Christian Curnyn conducts a small ensemble hidden away to the right.The premise is that the action takes place this year in London, with Purcell’s opera being broadcast live on the radio. From a Purcellian point of view, the result is to make his work into a kind of background commentary, with poetry even read above the orchestral score at times. In the circumstances, it is hardly surprising that the singing – even from such notable performers as Sue Bickley, who doubles as Dido and the Sorceress – registers as a muted add-on and not as the heart of the evening. A recording would have done just as well.Above and beyond, we see four individuals in crises of loss and despair, their emotional states explored without much context for their obvious depression. The withdrawn, solitary young woman who prepares a meal for herself before taking her suicide pills in a kind of ritual, all to the undeniably affecting accompaniment of Dido’s Lament, is finely realised by Amanda Hale, although ultimately neither she nor the other characters need Purcell’s music as a background to the presentation of their individual sorrows.

One huge, full company number even has walk on parts for Lenin, Marx and Uncle Joe Stalin.The fun keeps on coming – statues springing to sudden life, all of the neighbours tightly packed into one room, some crazy costumes and hilarious songs. You really have to admire a lyricist – David Pountney – who can rhyme ‘toilet’ with ‘spoilt it’ and keep that standard.Summer Strallen makes her Opera North debut as Lidochka, a museum guide chased by subversive rocker Boris (Eaton James). She is a visual and performing treat, he has style and presence in abundance. Their duets are smashing, varying from a wild Elvis pastiche to a romantic ballad with each singing introspectively.Having an ankle in a pot does not hinder Bibi Heal’s pert and knowing performance, as a wife who can only meet her husband during the day time because they do not have a room to call their own. Her injury is made part of the story.Specialist dancers underpin the staging of songs and the Opera North chorus moves with studied effect. The company orchestra is brought in on the action, being addressed many times by the main characters. Top form and top fun from everyone.

Although Dante Ferretti’s sets, with their references to Visconti’s films (set at the period of the Risorgimento), have a certain relevance, an air of medieval mayhem is missing – Leonora’s abduction from a railway station somehow lacks the resonance of being snatched away from a convent. But what happens within the sets is a good deal more apposite than the sets themselves.Barnstorming his way through the piece to tremendous effect is Dmitri Hvorostovsky as the Count of Luna, a dark-hearted villain finely realised physically and stunningly sung – it’s hard to imagine anyone who could touch him in this role today. Roberto Alagna’s Manrico provides a more than presentable opponent, despite an often cavalier attitude to Verdi’s rhythms, which conductor Carlo Rizzi nevertheless purveys with considerable panache.Less certain of their mark are the two women. Sondra Radvanovsky has the full vocal measure of Leonora and stays the course in what is a long and demanding evening. Yet her singing lacks momentum and a strong sense of character. In another star role, Polish mezzo Malgorzata Walewska offers solid vocal material, but her Azucena rarely seizes the centre of attention. Not quite the full pack of cards, then, but enough of the piece hits home to make it memorable.

It works superbly, with all the elements of the show moving seamlessly together to articulate Purcell’s potent miniature tragedy.Sarah Connolly rises to the grand emotional challenge of Dido, with Lucas Meachem solid as the vacillating Aeneas and Lucy Crowe a cheerfully supportive Belinda. The witches are cleverly presented, with Sara Fulgoni leading the forces of darkness. Conductor Christopher Hogwood maintains taut control of the score, with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment in the pit.Acis and Galatea is not so sure-fire, partly because its mode is not as inherently theatrical – Handel never seems to have presented it with stage action – and partly because here McGregor generally separates the choreography from the rest of the staging. In effect, there are two centres of interest competing for our attention. Bechtler’s designs give us a rather grubby Arcadia and Hogwood’s conducting has its lethargic moments. The broadly light-hearted tone is missed.But Charles Workman sings a vigorous Acis, Matthew Rose a menacing comic-grotesque Polyphemus and Danielle de Niese is sheer delight as Galatea, even throwing in some elegant dancing.

Suicide becomes her only option.The Czech composer’s heartfelt score registers impressively in an orchestral reduction by Tony Burke that is finely performed by the orchestra under Michael Rosewell’s sure-footed baton.Adam Wiltshire’s sets and costumes create an atmospheric representation of pre-revolutionary Russia, with an oppressively enclosed feel to the interior of the Kabanov home and an imaginative conjuring of the ruined church where Katya’s fatal admission takes place. In James Conway’s fine-grained production the small roles mesh with the larger portrayals and an articulate use of the chorus to create a closely-defined society where the traditions of the past stifle human feeling and individuality.Linda Richardson’s limpid soprano combines with a firmness of dramatic purpose to uncover Katya’s vulnerability and depth of feeling. Fiona Kimm’s implacable Kabanicha makes a striking impact on her every appearance. Colin Judson excels as her weak-willed son, Tichon, as does Richard Roberts as Boris, Katya’s lover. His uncle, the boorish Dikoy, is powerfully realised by Sion Goronwy.This is a winning presentation of a masterpiece of late romantic opera that will win Janacek many new admirers as it travels the country.

The cast has been strengthened and the impact of the whole is overwhelming.The story of a young village girl whose illegitimate baby is murdered by her own stepmother to save them both from shame, and of the two half-brothers, one of whom makes her pregnant while the other marries her, is among the most emotional tales opera has to offer, and its final scene, as Jenufa and Laca face the future together as a couple, is profoundly inspiring.Certainly as performed here. Roocroft has developed into one of the great actresses on the operatic stage, and her lyric soprano is deployed with thrilling imagination. As the feckless Steva, Tom Randle’s energy and dramatic command flesh out a complete portrayal founded on his keen-edged tenor. As his unloved half-brother Laca, Robert Brubaker’s blend of hatred and love pours out in his high-charged vocalism. The American mezzo Michaela Martens sings Kostelnicka, the flawed stepmother whose terrible deed becomes credible in another sure and certain realisation.The small roles are expertly delivered and ENO’s chorus and orchestra are outstanding, with the score perfectly balanced by Norwegian conductor Eivind Gullberg Jensen. It’s a truly great evening.

But Liam Steel’s new production for English Touring Opera sets the action in a contained panelled room, giving the impression of a theatre of the mind, in which all the characters’ traits haphazardly coexist. A series of tiers, doors and trap-doors add to the disorientation. The overall effect is enhanced by Chloe Lamford’s stage and costume designs – the former in deep midnight blue and the latter striking a contemporary note while retaining an authentic feel. The priests’ high-necked white frockcoats immediately suggest purity, mystery and austerity.The principal cast members are all strong. Mark Wilde sings Tamino with an Italianate ring that is nicely smoothed at the edges. He is an ideal foil to Daniel Grice’s genuinely funny Papageno, who commands the audience without becoming too showy. Vocally attractive, Grice is equally accomplished in projecting the spoken dialogue. The same isn’t so for Laure Meloy’s Queen of Night, whose stratospheric second aria, especially, is boldly and brightly sung, but her weak dialogue undermines her role as Pamina’s scheming mother. Paula Sides proves herself equally impressive in singing and speech and especially able to conjure up fine emotional shading in her upper range, as heard in her heartfelt Act II rejection aria. Only Ronald Nairne’s Speaker is a disappointment – though he struck a stoical stance physically, there was a forced quality to the voice. Paul McGrath not only garners sprightly playing, but also captures a sense of grand ceremony, directing ETO’s fine orchestra.

For that alone this is a special evening. In an ideal world, the Italian text would be savoured more, and there would be greater light and shade, but this remains an exceptional vocal duo. Garanca is particularly striking as the adolescent youth in love.Strong support from Dario Schmunck’s feisty Tebaldo and a discerning Capellio from Eric Owens, though Giovanni Battista Parodi’s Lorenzo lacks weight.The chorus are on fine form, even if Pizzi’s 1984 staging, carefully revived by Massimo Gasparon, asks very little of them but to stand and deliver. As a representation of what audiences might have seen in Venice in 1830, it has a certain historic interest. As a living recreation of a drama Bellini clearly took seriously, it is inert to a degree.Fortunately, a lot of the drama lies in the vocal lines, and they do not disappoint. It’s there, too, in Mark Elder’s authoritative conducting, which captures not only the style but the fire and melancholy of the score.

That may be a harsh summary of David Freeman’s in the round production of Bizet’s popular favourite, but it wasn’t altogether unfair.Updating the setting to the twenties doesn’t mean that David Roger’s costumes for the cigarette factory girls need to be quite so frumpy and colourless – clad in these, it is little wonder the girls fail to set the soldiers’ pulses racing. Cristina Nassif as Carmen produces a distinctly not incendiary Habanera (during which she had a little trouble keeping in time with the orchestra). And principal characters regularly get swamped among the crowds, making the centre of action sometimes difficult to place – especially since the amplified voices, inevitable in this space, lose their positioning on the stage. The centre of Roger’s serpent-shaped stage platform neatly houses the factory workers in Act I and (at a pinch) the bullfight spectators in Act IV, but it makes for extended exits that are amputated of drama.Though the handful of arid trees in Act III are attractive, they tend to wobble, and their levitation before Act IV into the Royal Albert Hall’s high dome, despite being an efficient means of removal, creates a strangely otherworldly effect of its own.John Dazsak’s Don Jose and Nassif’s Carmen are both well sung in places, but the microphones remove a good deal of nuance. Singing Micaela, Elizabeth Atherton is alone in never losing an emotional connection with her character. Freeman creates a well-planned parade of fire-jugglers, gymnasts and dancers ahead of the bullfight, but it’s not quite enough to lift what is overall a somewhat bland rendition of this colourful tale of passion and violence.

Like its predecessors Nixon in China and The Death of Klinghoffer, Doctor Atomic selects a subject from modern history – in this case, the testing of the atom bomb in the New Mexico desert in 1945. The chief characters are the scientists involved – primarily Robert Oppenheimer, trenchantly sung here by Gerald Finley, and Edward Teller, delivered with equivalent authority by Brindley Sherratt, plus their military colleagues, led by Jonathan Veira’s dominating General Groves. Humanising the lengthy discussions of scientific data and weather reports are an intimate scene between Oppenheimer and his wife Kitty, resiliently sung by Sasha Cooke, and an intervention by their Native American servant, Pasqualita, played by Meredith Arwady, who sings a lullaby to her baby. A Tewa Indian chorus observes the activities at the Los Alamos base.The main difference between Doctor Atomic and its predecessors is the librettist. Whereas Alice Goodman was able to give the first two range and resonance with her poetic texts, Peter Sellars’ compilation of extracts from historic documents has a dusty, unnatural feel. Even the poems quoted by the characters – the John Donne setting that ends Act I is the score’s high point – merely underline its artificiality.Designed by Julian Crouch, Penny Woolcock’s production works hard to keep the piece alive, but neither she nor conductor Lawrence Renes can stop the result from seeming portentous and dull.

The opera is moved forward to the Rome of 1968 – a year of social unrest and student revolt. The ambience and period are finely suggested in a lively Roman street scene with a bar and the portico of the church outside which Cavaradossi works on his pavement art representation of Mary Magdalene. An abandoned car becomes a crucial element in the last act, when Tosca’s suicide is re-enacted in a novel and shocking way. The first act works brilliantly, though the lack of an interior robs the great Act II confrontation between Tosca and Scarpia of a sense of claustrophobia.The strongest element of this first of two casts is the Scarpia of David Stephenson. A cold and calculating presence right from his first entrance, he grips the attention with his trenchantly sung and dramatically dangerous characterisation. The young Welsh tenor Adriano Graziani shows considerable promise and a genuine sense of style as Cavaradossi. Julia Melinek acts Tosca astutely, though her voice sounds workaday in the glamorous central role.Strong standouts from John Lofthouse’s nerdy Sacristan and Paul Reeves’ suave revolutionary Angelotti give the first act impetus, while Scarpia’s henchmen are impeccably menacing in the persons of Benjamin Segal’s Spoletta and Henry Grant Kerswell’s Sciarrone. Conductor Phillip Thomas’s reading of the score registers strongly.

He does not disappoint. His wide-ranging instrument is ideal for the role of the accursed sea captain. Though his first scene is not ideally focused, later on he sounds out the recesses of the complex, tortured character with nuanced subtlety as well as weight.German soprano Anja Kampe triumphs as Senta, the young woman whose obsession with the Dutchman leads her to defy sense and convention and sacrifice herself for him. Her singing is not of the bludgeoning Wagnerian soprano type. Instead, she explores the role from inside out, drawing on the pale lyricism of her instrument as much as its cutting edge.Both Torsten Kerl as Senta’s rejected lover Erik and Hans-Peter Konig as her father Daland give high-quality accounts.Modern costumes by Constance Hoffman and lowering sets by Michael Levine support a production by Tim Albery that is at its finest in the intimate scenes but produces some striking images for the crowded set-pieces, where the Royal Opera chorus is on sensational form.The version performed is the conflation of the piece into one long act that Wagner planned but never executed. More controversial is the decision to perform the earliest version of the score, with the overture and the entire opera shorn of their expansive revised endings. But there’s some thrilling playing and conductor Marc Albrecht does an impressive job.

But fate determined otherwise.After 15 minutes the stage and auditorium lights failed, and only following an extended delay was it decided to give the piece in concert form in the foyer. Many of the audience stayed, however, and they were not disappointed.Based on The Pied Piper of Hamelin story, Benjamin’s neat two-hander, to a libretto by Martin Crimp, has plenty of disturbing resonances, pointing obliquely to notorious recent and historic instances of ethnic cleansing. The score is strong on instrumental atmosphere, finely realised here by the London Sinfonietta under the composer’s baton. Given the circumstances, its dramatic viability is impossible to assess, though Fulljames’s production was going well until regrettably cut short, despite the text’s reliance on reported speech and lack of visible action.The first half is extremely impressive. To a libretto by Michael Nyman that conflates various English folk sources – mummers’ plays and ballads about a cruel mother who murders her children – Down by the Greenwood Side (1969) shows Birtwistle writing in the manner of his classic Punch and Judy in a piece of music theatre blending ritual, violence and grim humour. Sharp acting performances match well with Soutra Gilmour’s designs, and the whole goes with a bang.

Nucci recorded the title role more than 20 years ago and in the first act he seems a spent force, only to surprise with his powerful if unsubtle delivery later on. His physical acting is less insectile than that of Paolo Gavanelli, who created the role in this production, but he may have more voice. Kurt Rydl is the assassin Sparafucile, black-toned and Wagnerian, his sister Maddalena is the appropriately feisty Sara Fulgoni. Iain Paterson, looking too young, shines fleetingly in the role of Monterone. As Gilda, Rigoletto’s over-protected daughter, Ekaterina Siurina’s wan innocence seems manufactured and impervious to plot developments. No matter. The wonderfully clear, consistent timbre displayed throughout her range takes in Verdi’s sweet high notes with ease.The other star of the show is Michael Vale’s rotating set, with shadowy lighting by Paule Constable adding to the air of menace. It’s thrifty too – even the distressed perspex slab of palace looks to be accessed by an upended stepladder. Public and private worlds are carefully defined yet corrupting squalor is pointedly endemic to both. The orgy that opens the show is a distraction that no longer shocks – did it ever? – but when the curtain falls we feel we have witnessed a powerful allegory of a society on the slide.Daniel Oren, ceding primacy to his singers, fails to impart much in the way of drive or character from the pit.

It’s moved to the Paris of the thirties in Isabella Bywater’s designs. The costumes are handsome, the set ingeniously contrived to open up from an apartment block for the outer acts to the street scenes of the middle two. The latter work extremely well. But the intimacy of the artists’ garret where Mimi and Rodolfo fall in love and she eventually dies loses impact by being too high up and far away from the audience. Nor does Miller’s direction allow us to involve ourselves in the intricacies of the central relationships.Alfie Boe’s Rodolfo and Melody Moore’s Mimi don’t connect often enough and certainly not in the last act, where she dies without raising her head or being touched by him. Something emblematically fragile about the brevity and failure of their love has gone missing.Stronger is the Cafe Momus scene, where Hanan Alattar’s Musetta hits the button and the chorus are terrific. Keen cameos from Simon Butteriss’ Benoit and Richard Angas’ Alcindoro, while Pauls Putnins’ Colline delivers a considered Coat Song. Boe sings sweetly though not with great volume. Moore possesses a strong lyric soprano that could go places.Amanda Holden’s new translation is neat and effective and a good deal of it comes over.

But George S Kaufman’s and Morrie Ryskind’s book, and Ira Gershwin’s lyrics offer a light-hearted and even light-headed view of politics and politicians, though brother George’s score is several cuts above the thirties Broadway average in ambition and sheer ingenuity.Carried off with the level of assurance and perfected ensemble that Opera North’s top-notch company brings to it, the result doesn’t aspire to depth, but there’s plenty of wit to keep audiences plentifully entertained.Caroline Gawn’s staging maintains constant momentum and the cast ensures that every word comes across. Highlights include Richard Suart’s bumbling General Snookfield and his sassy sidekick, Jeni Bern’s Trixie Flynn, Richard Burkhard’s sinister Kruger and Steven Beard’s delightfully daffy Throttlebottom, but there are no weak links.

But now that the composer – still best known for his Hollywood film scores – is enjoying a major revival, it has its belated UK stage debut.And welcome it is, too. The score is an outstandingly accomplished example of late-Romanticism at its most gorgeous. Korngold’s technical skills are second to none and the Covent Garden players revel in the score in an incisive reading under conductor Ingo Metzmacher.The story is strange but compelling. In the ancient city of Bruges, Paul is in perpetual mourning for his dead wife, Marie, until he meets and becomes fascinated by the young dancer Marietta, who is her double. Lively and emotionally promiscuous, Marietta taunts him for his obsession with a dead woman, until he strangles her with his dead wife’s hair. Then he wakes up. Only Marietta’s first visit to his home was real. Paul decides to leave Bruges and the memory of his former life behind.Willy Decker’s staging, imaginatively designed by Wolfgang Gussman, emphasises the fantastic unreality of much of the action. Stephen Gould brings authentic Heldentenor power to the central role, with Nadja Michael committed as Marie/Marietta, even if her pitching has some dubious moments. It’s a worthwhile show and a work that lovers of Strauss and Puccini will fall in love with.

The traditional thrust of the narrative remains, yet there is a sense that the conflicts of light and darkness might be taking place within any community.Emily Hindrichs’ Queen of Night, plainly too young to have a grown-up daughter, lacks authority and vocal power, but she does have the technique for her big number – it helps that the production does not require her to be the embodiment of evil. Her retinue of ladies strike sparks as much through brilliant costuming and direction as vocal distinction.Only Papageno is truly world class. The role is one that Roderick Williams has made very much his own and his freshness and warmth save a musically unremarkable evening. The homely Coronation Street locution is dropped once he actually sings and his astounding diction puts his colleagues to shame.The new Tamino, Robert Murray, has a vibrant, barely controlled top while Sarah-Jane Davies, his experienced Pamina, is merely reliable. The Sarastro of Robert Lloyd, 69 this March, is authoritative, with all the notes in place if no longer richly upholstered. Stuart Kale’s Monostatos is a pantomimic crowd-pleaser – Hercule Poirot with a pigtail.There are occasional coordination problems with the pit as young Erik Nielsen – making his company debut – tries to give the music more space and softer contours than his recent predecessors.

Plastic surgeon Dr Needlemeier’s Swiss clinic is dedicated to “putting right what Nature got wrong”. His daughter will only marry her boyfriend Robert if he has some work done. Needlemeier beautifies receptionist Donna, with whom he is having an affair, while his wife Lania constantly redesigns herself. Hollywood star Luke Pollock has one of his testicles surreptitiously removed by Needlemeier to add to his secret elixir of youth, made up of human body parts. It’s a darkly comic fantasy, with identities confused as faces are swapped and individuals duplicated, though its progress towards an ineffective third-act climax seems convoluted and over-populated. Despite Sawer keeping the orchestra down, not all the text comes across, and what does lacks the bite of The Thick of It.Some of Sawer’s score is genuinely attractive, though little of it hits the dramatic spot – even an uproarious second-act finale a la Rossini peters out. Elsewhere it lacks the memorability needed for theatrical success, whatever the genre, and also momentum.But Opera North does it proud, with a sharp and snappy production by Richard Jones to neat designs by Stewart Laing. Two performances are pure brilliance – Geoffrey Dolton’s suavely sinister Needlemeier and Janis Kelly’s languid Lania – while Mark Stone’s Hollywood hunk is fun.

It was also openly satirical of the upper class and the Establishment.Justin Way’s new production drags the opera into present-day Soho, where the Peachums run an off-licence and the tavern that Macheath repairs to becomes a brothel. The updating allows for some eye-catching designs (Kimm Kovac and Andrew Hays), with chiller cabinets transforming into whore-house display booths, and the set features ornate theatre balconies, from where the chorus monitors the action. Another contemporary twist sees Suzy Tawdry, one of the hookers, decked up in Uma Thurman’s yellow jumpsuit from Kill Bill. Mostly the updating is at least colourful and immediate, though it can seem out of kilter with Gay’s libretto: ‘Truly Filch, thy observation is right,’ declares Peachum, while the Beggar (here ostensibly an usher, who, by the way, maintains a nervous and needless presence throughout much of the production) pays for her booze by credit card.The cast, though, is beyond reproach. Jeremy White sings, acts and delivers his dialogue as Peachum with equal naturalness, Leah-Marian Jones struts her stuff uninhibitedly as Polly and Sarah Fox as Macheath’s other lovestruck devotee, Lucy Lockit, sings affectingly, not least in her If Love’s a Sweet Passion. But Tom Randle truly anchors the cast. He gives Macheath a somehow likeable sheen, impressing as much with his vocal and acting talents and, before the philanderer’s sudden reprieve at the opera’s end, elicits genuine pity as a condemned man.

The lighting is evocative, particularly the lantern-lit opening of Act III, and both costumes and choreography remain vivid if unsubtle.One of the few Italians involved in the show, conductor Nicola Luisotti makes much of the score’s raw barbarism, although two subdued episodes, the glorious choral invocation to the rising moon and the depiction of Liu’s funeral cortege, are delivered with patient refinement.Whether in the interests of dramatic continuity or simply to help sub-prime singers get round their high-lying phrases, the biggest set-piece arias fly by.Bravely stepping in for an indisposed Irene Theorin, Elizabeth Connell is not the most physically or vocally imposing of Turandots and she takes a while to warm up. The same might be said of Jose Cura, a Calaf who tries to make sense of the drama, yet comes across as bullish, with a voice that’s mostly middle and no top.The supporting roles are no more than adequately taken. At least Paata Burchuladze’s broken-down, Boris-like Timur retains a definite stage presence and Robert Tear’s geriatric Emperor Altoum (his last stage role for Covent Garden) never strays off pitch.The Bulgarian soprano Svetla Vassileva, an experienced Liu in other houses, has a warm Slavic timbre that projects little of the character’s vulnerability. The commedia dell’arte machinations of Ping, Pang and Pong make no particular impression, Giorgio Caoduro’s Ping is sung through a cold.

Unfortunately the magic spell doesn’t quite work this time around.Part of the problem lies in the pit, where Sir Colin Davies seems curiously disengaged. There’s a lack of character, or a variety of rich colours, in this class post-Wagnerian score.Caurier and Leiser’s regular designers do a fine professional job, though some of their imagery doesn’t work. The opening cottage scene is unproblematic and Angelika Kirchschlager’s Hansel and Diana Damran’s Gretel are spot-on. Despite solid performances from Thomas Allen and Elizabeth Connell as their parents, they are not quite right either, and when revealed in the armchairs of the dream pantomime sequence in the forest, they strike the wrong note.The wood turns from nature idyll to threatening environment effectively, but again the two supernatural beings – Pumea Matshikiza’s Sandman and Anita Watson’s Dew Fairy – are unfortunate visually, the latter with a touch of the drag act. Angels with teddy bear faces look distinctly unprepossessing.Even Anja Silja’s much looked forward to Witch Misses the goal. Why does she have her breasts on display at the start? The high-tech kitchen emulates Richard Jones’ award-winning production without equalling it. The kids hung up at the back are gruesome and when they come back to life and sing, sound unpowered. Somehow the crucial balance of dark and light has been missed.

Big, bold and dazzlingly bright, this is an operatic feast that takes hold from the off and refuses to relinquish its grip.It’s a show that’s full of surprises, too. The brass band introduction at the beginning of the overture gives a mere taste of the Andalucian authenticity other productions might lack, especially as the action takes place within and without the walls of a gigantic bull ring. There is also the exceptional flamenco talent of Samantha Quy to feast upon, which adds further dimension to this classic tale of love and death. As for the added conclusion – suffice to say it works exceptionally well.Irina Vinogradova’s spurned Micaela is sublime. Irakli Grigali’s Don Jose is brim-full of jealous rage and terrific presence. Petru Racovita’s Escamillo – a heavy tumble from a tabletop not withstanding – is overflowing with vanity and self-importance.Yet it is Zarui Vardanean’s mezzo-soprano voice and perfect dark gypsy beauty, combined with the rare ability for an opera star to act, which will live long in the memory. Vardanean not only takes on the role of Carmen, she possesses it lock, stock and barrel and turns the whole show into something quite exceptional.

A doughty champion of Vaughan Williams, his broad, expressive pacing remains much in evidence.By sticking close to J M Synge’s concentrated original, VW for once produces a viably theatrical vehicle, yet its very brevity and intimacy pose problems in such a large house.Fiona Shaw and her team seek to open up the drama in unexpected ways. They begin with a preludial performance of Sibelius’ Luonnotar (Nature Spirit), dispatched quite magnificently in the original Finnish by Susan Gritton. A maternal Melisande in an upended boat she looks like something out of Klimt. Behind her, an ambitious video installation of watery images is equally ravishing. There follows the briefest scene-setting interlude, sound montage courtesy of John Woolrich, and we are into the main event, the particular claustrophobia of Synge’s Aran cottage kitchen lost in a symbolic topography of capsized boats and rocky outcroppings. One wonky ladder apart, the setting works well enough on the open stage. The score, seemingly reluctant to assert itself at the expense of text, keeps harmonic options open and words audible. Patricia Bardon brings authority and a genuine Irish accent to the pivotal role of Maurya, the bereaved mother. Making her ENO debut, the always eloquent Claire Booth is equally striking as Nora. Maurya has a premonition in which her dead son Michael is seen leading her one surviving son, Bartley, into the sea. Controversially, Shaw makes Michael a concrete stage presence impersonated by an actor, Oliver Kieran-Jones.ENO music director Edward Gardner, stepping into the breach at short notice, and Shaw, whose introduction to the world of opera direction could scarcely have been more distressing, may yet have a hit on their hands.

While Maria Bjornson’s costumes still look sumptuous, William Dudley’s monumental sets make for noisy and protracted scene changes, as during the reprise of the famous Barcarolle.Offenbach may have wanted all four villains to be played by one bass-baritone, all four lovers by a single soprano. Here we get the first but not the second, the bad guys nevertheless well differentiated in terms of physique and bearing. Alas Gidon Saks’ vocal performance is rather less impressive with low notes lacking and a tendency to shout. His leering Lindorf reappears at the end of each segment to emphasize the continuity otherwise lacking in a staging long on spectacle and short on psychological insight.Revisiting the role with which he made his 2004 house debut, Rolando Villazon eventually finds his best form and roundest tone, though his pressurised vocal delivery can misfire and does not always carry to the back of the theatre. One of the most distinctive voices of his generation, he is also a fluent actor. Likewise the veteran Graham Clark, louder than anyone else as a succession of misshapen manservants.On to the ladies. Olympia is brilliantly dispatched by Ekaterina Lekhina, a newcomer to Covent Garden, every inch the doll who comes to life when Hoffmann dons his rose-tinted specs. Christine Rice is vocally well-endowed as a mezzo courtesan Giulietta. Katie Van Kooten animates the doomed Antonia with her fresh, ardent soprano and Gaynor Keeble shines briefly as her mother’s spirit. Kristine Jepson is convincing, both as Hoffmann’s constant companion, Nicklausse, and his (feminized) poetic muse.In the pit, Antonio Pappano conducts without the special caressing fervour he brings to Italian scores of the period. There’s nothing French about the show, another reason why it should perhaps be retired.

The plainest is the 1869 original, rejected by the Imperial Theatres of Musorgsky’s day, which is essentially what the English National Opera performs. In its starkness and economy, it is arguably the most potent of all.Yet the piece does not register as it should. Albery’s sombre production, placed in a large wooden box that initially looks like a superior village barn in Tobias Hoheisel’s set, lacks the visual sweep of an epic, which the piece is, however concentrated. Brigitte Reiffenstuel’s costumes move from Boris’ own time (around 1600) up to the end of tsarist rule in 1917, although logically they might continue through Stalin to Putin. The piece is about a recurrent Russian need for a ruthless ruler, however flawed.Many of the individual performances lack dramatic focus. Peter Rose’s lyrically sung Boris comes over as someone’s favourite uncle rather than the guilty child-murderer of the plot. He’s outclassed by Brindley Sherratt’s noble scribe Pimen and Jonathan Veira’s rumbustious monk-on-the-run Varlaam. Gregory Turay’s pretender Dmitri hasn’t enough to do in this version to make a solid impact, and John Graham-Hall’s Shuisky is vocally awry, but conductor Edward Gardner steers the company through a convincing reading of the score.

Her presentation of Strauss’ disturbed heroine manages the feat of delivering all the vocal heft while remaining beautifully sung throughout. Dramatically, she is focused and intelligent in what proves a potent realisation of the part. At the end, the audience fete her like a queen.Some of what surrounds her is more mixed. Anne Schwanewilms’ Chrysothemis comes and goes vocally and doesn’t quite hit the dramatic spot. Jane Henschel’s Klytemnestra begins like a pantomime dame and though she has some memorable moments – her excessive laughter on learning of her son’s death is certainly notable – cannot supply the vocal guns to match Bullock in their big scene together. But Johan Reuter makes a vocally bracing Orestes, creating a palpable sense of expectancy in the great recognition scene.The small parts are all decently done, but while Alfie Boe does everything required of the Young Servant, it is hard to understand why the ROH cannot offer this talented artist a better role than this.Charles Edwards’s partly self-designed production leaves a mixed impression, with the final scene a fiery bloodbath that diverts attention from the protagonist. Conductor Mark Elder draws excellent playing from the orchestra and displays much of the great score to its advantage without managing to create an arc of consistently rising tension.

Because of the involvement of a distinguished novelist, the work has received a lot of pre-publicity.McEwan’s original story centres on Charles, an egocentric senior composer/conductor who takes a fancy to a female horn player and starts an affair with her – or would have, if he were not impotent. His long-suffering wife Antonia, meanwhile, has some unspecified illness and needs a major operation. Philandering Charles bullies his assistant Robin and just about everyone in his vicinity, though his Polish housemaid Maria has conceived a secret passion for him and in a bizarre denouement, murders the hospitalised Antonia.The characters and their mode of speech seem utterly contrived. Berkeley has a tough job on his hands to make the improbable scenario live musically, and doesn’t succeed in doing so. The result is much weaker than his previous operas.For all that, Music Theatre Wales do their very best with poor material and the cast works hard in Michael McCarthy’s assured production. Simon Banham’s versatile set works well. Alan Opie makes Charles larger than life, if not credible, and conductor Michael Rafferty secures a solidly purposeful account of the score.

He’s never looked back, and the leading Rossini tenor of our day reprises the part of the ridiculously macho man here to knockout effect in a more recent Pesaro staging. Not only does he sing rings round Rossini’s absurdly tricky notes, but his physical acting and athleticism are also sensationally good.He’s well backed by a strong cast, led by Alexsandra Kurzak as the woman who finally thaws his misogynist resolve. She gets the final showpiece aria and the last bow as the opera’s titular heroine. Also making a keen impression are Alfonso Antoniozzi as the bumptious Neapolitan poet, Isidoro, and Enkelejda Shkosa as Matilde’s scheming rival, the Countess D’Arco. More mixed is Vesselina Kasarova in the trouser-role of Corradino’s captive, Edoardo. Her vocal production is, to put it mildly, idiosyncratic, with the voice splitting into three segments, but she remains a touching and involving performer.Martone’s production is strong in personal direction and while Sergio Tramonti’s double-staircase set is less than beautiful, it’s well employed. The neglected score is full of good things, including some spiffing ensembles, neatly despatched under Carlo Rizzi’s baton. But this is Florez’s evening, and he does not disappoint.

A young couple, Albert and Gertrude, arrive in their new house as their new Housekeeper unpacks, and bickering ensues (perhaps tempered by the Housekeeper’s presence) after Gertrude discovers the place is less than fully eco-friendly – “Half sun, half grid. It’s a hybrid,” enthuses Albert. Albert’s attachment to the material world is poignantly emphasised in Gertrude’s ravishing, almost Straussian aria, in which she reminisces while admiring the sun’s reflection on the lake. Weisman perhaps relies too heavily on minimalist-like repeated-note accompaniment – with which the players, under conductor Graham Ross, seem under-engaged – but the vocal music is sympathetically written for the voices, and Jane Harrington’s Gertrude, David Butt Philip’s Albert and Hannah Pedley’s Housekeeper all deliver fine performances.It’s in Bernstein’s critique of cosy fifties American suburban life, Trouble in Tahiti, that director Oliver Mears can more openly flex his muscle and he presents a stylish, well-observed and atmospheric production, with strong performances from the central couple, Sam (Toby Stafford Allen) and Dinah (Hannah Pedley). The musical direction here, too, could be more focused, but the singers across this trio of operas are well cast and directed.If Second Movement can maintain this profile of producing probing performances of well-chosen rarities and commissions, this could be an exciting and innovative boon to the London opera scene.

And if those garish dreamworld designs of gold and ultramarine tend to dwarf the action, this is scarcely the first production of Aida of which that might be said.The final scene is modestly staged with the doomed lovers gradually enclosed in the darkness of their pyramidal tomb. Elsewhere the camp stage business fails to mask a lack of directorial nous. It rains gold twice in case you miss it the first time. The elephant of turquoise silk and papier-mache is an effective indulgence, but sets and lighting are curiously rudimentary and much of the work’s dramatic core goes AWOL on the flat, open stage. You can forget Verdi’s critique of political and religious authoritarianism.The main protagonists are returnees. Claire Rutter’s competent Aida is again partnered by John Hudson’s rather wooden Radames, his impressive vocal heft compromised by autumnal sniffles. Iain Paterson’s Amonasro is the evening’s standout – transcending the silliness of his Fuzzy-Wuzzy get up, he actually sounds Verdian. Jane Dutton, on the other hand, plays Amneris as an Ab-Fab hysteric, taking her cue from an unwieldy hair-do and dodgy frock (she lacks the vocal qualities usually associated with the role).After 40 years with ENO, Gwynne Howell portrays a Pharaoh getting on in years, still enunciating with impressive clarity. His equal in this respect is Matthew Best, a Ramfis new to this production with the vocal gravitas appropriate to the power behind the throne. Gerard Korsten has some problems in the pit in an underwhelming ENO debut.

The setting is a manor house in the West Country in the 18th century, where the deserter Boconnion and his two companions gain access and murder the owner. As they prepare to steal the valuables and then leave, the trio’s plans are interrupted by the arrival of a troupe of travelling actors seeking refuge from the weather. The players perform The Mines of Sulphur, which comes uncomfortably close to mirroring events at the manor. Things turn nasty and there is a shock ending.It’s in a similar mould to Hammer horror movies of the period, although with a higher artistic aim. Cross’s libretto is effective. But despite Bennett being one of our most accomplished and versatile composers, his score for this piece, couched in a serial language and with a generally post-Second Viennese School feel to it, is undistinguished.That said, Michael Barker-Caven’s staging is finely achieved within Joe Vanek’s powerfully atmospheric set. The cast handles the unease of the drama persuasively. Especially memorable are John Bellemer as the violent, unstable Boconnion, Thomas Goerz as the wary tramp Tovey, Krisztina Szabo as the gypsy Rosalind and John Packard as Sherrin, the actors’ leader.

But many of Wexford’s happiest rediscoveries have been made in the Italian 19th century repertory, and Pedrotti’s 1856 comedy undoubtedly proves this year’s hit.It’s a clever piece about the fortunes of a below average Italian opera troupe hired by the wealthy Turkish impresario Abdala for a forthcoming season in Damascus. Buffoonery on all sides, amorous and professional rivalry (especially between the soprano and the mezzo) and a final masked ball scene in which, as the title suggests, everyone is in disguise, give plenty of opportunities both for the skilful composer and for director Rosetta Cucchi to have fun with. Pedrotti’s score has a perfect first act and is never less than enjoyable – the parodies (notably, cheekily, of Verdi himself) especially. Stylishly designed as transferred to post-war Italy by Federico Bianchi (sets) and Claudia Pernigotti (costumes), Cucchi’s staging responds with verve to both text and music and is irrepressibly funny.She’s aided by some fine performances. Sarah Coburn delivers a star turn as prima donna Vittoria, with high notes a-flying. Her double act with Laura Vlasak Nolen’s rival Dorotea is a hoot. Enrico Marabelli’s dapper Abdala, Marco Filippo Romano’s hilarious Gregorio and Brad Cooper’s Emilio are all perfectly in the picture. Leonardo Vordoni conducts a spirited account of the score.

Based on a folk tale about the daughter of Spring Beauty and Father Frost, the Snow Maiden who melts at the end of the opera, it shows the composer inventively mining the resources of Russian folk music to marvellous effect. The score is superbly played by the Wexford Festival Orchestra under Dmitri Jurowski.Wexford’s new stage facilities are also shown off in a vital and colourful staging by John Fulljames that blends orthodox folk elements with images of the modern Russian Mafia in Dick Bird’s potent designs.A strong cast show themselves well-versed in the idiom and coping impressively with the piece’s substantial vocal and dramatic demands.

Act I’s cramped, run-down urban setting, with its rusting fences and crumbling buildings, is no sunny picture-postcard of Seville, but it does present a suitably gritty backdrop for the basic instincts shared by the cigarette girls and the soldiers posted nearby.In Act II, Lillas Pastia’s claustrophobic, smoky basement bar is the setting for a gyrating gypsies’ dance that whips up into a frenzy, as well as Carmen’s seductive solo turn for Don Jose’s eyes only.Making her title-role debut, American mezzo Katherine Rohrer sometimes has to work hard to wrap her svelte, model-like physique around Carmen’s rough manners and flighty sensibility, and she has a vocal lightness that makes the job yet more tricky, but she sings with focus and passion. Passion seemed to elude Yongoon Lee’s Don Jose in his Act I duet with Carmen and though he warms up quickly, it’s surely that incendiary first meeting with the gypsy seductress that sets our antihero on his journey of self-destruction.Natasha Jouhl sings a splendid Micaela – the embodiment of the wholesome life Don Jose should be choosing. Other striking performances come in Dawid Kimberg’s bullish corporal, Morales, Lukas Jakobski’s deep-toned lieutenant Zuniga and Richard Mosley-Evans’ sharp-witted smuggler Le Dancaire. Only Jean-Luc Ballestra’s Escamillo is mildly disappointing, for its wilted machismo, compounded by a dandyish double-breasted suit and white scarf.In the pit, young Czech conductor Jakub Hrusa commands fiery playing, drawing out Bizet’s vivid colouring with full extraction.

This was Nobel Prize-winner Heaney’s first text to be granted operatic treatment and the first opera to be directed by Caribbean director Derek Walcott (also a Nobel laureate); it was also the Globe’s first full staging of any opera.But, transferred to an anonymous South American republic (yet with musical narrations apparently in Trinidadian rapso-style rhythms), each layer of this multifarious whole seemed to detract from the drama, and from Heaney’s text. The updating neither felt convincingly current, nor allowed a stylised treatment of the drama. Of the singers, only Andrea Baker (Antigone’s sister, Ismene) was of obvious distinction; two other capable singers, Andy Morton as Haemon and Brian Green as Creon, were too often left to strain at the top of their ranges, and Idit Arad’s Antigone was disappointingly inadequate. Le Gendre’s bland incidental music took on an increasingly generic sound, never inventive enough to make the foreground, yet too shapeless and unvaried to convey the themes of Antigone’s moral strength, Creon’s guilt or the tragic destruction of her family. Too often monologues would be crammed into syllabic settings too fast to spit out the words. Music director Peter Manning had his head often in the score and failed to illicit much in the way of tautness from his ensemble of 13 players.Elevating neither Greek nor contemporary theatre, neither contemporary opera nor new music, this project – so auspicious on paper – appears to have been a major miscalculation. The world is not a better place for witnessing this Burial at Thebes, and like Antigone herself – though more deservedly so – it could well do with being walled up in a tomb and forgotten.

It’s a charming piece with an attractive score, and the Italian composer handles the comic situations to advantage, even if it sounds thin by comparison with his greatest contemporary – think Mozart-lite. It’s also a long evening – a few cuts in the second act wouldn’t hurt.Harry Fehr’s production sets the piece in the fifties, at the upmarket London townhouse home of Geronimo, wonderfully realised in Tom Rogers’s intricate set and his spot-on costumes. A couple of things don’t quite work. One is making Paolino into a household servant. In the original, he is the clerk to Geronimo’s merchant, which is less of a class bridge to jump within the social hierarchy. The second is sending disobedient daughter Carolina off to a convent – not very likely in fifties London.Other than that, Fehr’s lively, well-observed staging works a treat and most of the cast relishes the comic possibilities, though Andrew Slater’s Geronimo is too strait-laced. Particularly enjoyable are Renate Arends’ sharp-edged Elisetta and Wendy Dawn Thompson’s ripe Fidalma, while Matthew Garrett delivers an elegant Paolino and Quirijn de Lang’s Count Robinson has a touch of Hugh Grant in his well-bred manners. Rebecca Bottone makes a sweet Carolina though her voice has some pallid moments. Scottish Opera’s orchestra and conductor Garry Walker address the score crisply.

It’s sung in Amanda Holden’s clear new translation, but Christopher Alden’s staging is less easy to follow.A popular subject in its time, the original libretto tells of the eponymous queen and founder of the ancient city of Naples, and her several admirers, whose rivalry motivates the main plot. But it’s complicated by Rosmira, Arsace’s former betrothed, who has followed him disguised as the soldier Eurimene. The tangled web of relationships is familiar from other Handel operas – what makes this one unusual is that the mode of the piece is largely comic.That said, Alden’s decision to transfer the action to Paris in the twenties and turn one of Partenope’s suitors, Emilio, into the photographer Man Ray, and the other characters into his chic friends as portrayed in his photographs, merely swaps one arcane set-up for another. However stylish Andrew Lieberman’s sets and Jon Morrell’s costumes are, the basic narrative is no clearer.The score, however, contains many good things, including some fine ensembles and one or two sensationally beautiful arias. Rosemary Joshua shines as Partenope, even with a less than fluent top. John Mark Ainsley makes a strong impression as Emilio and Christine Rice is determined as Arsace. Best of all is the playing of ENO’s orchestra under the crisp baton of Christian Curnyn.

Almost all the characters are cats, though Simon Wilding plays the odd-animal-out with an energetic account of a dumb dog called Cludge.Hesketh-Harvey’s distillation makes for a densely packed two-act show, the basic plot of which is hard to follow. Varjak Paw, member of a superior clan of Mesopotamian Blues, becomes involved with other feline groups similar to street gangs in their propensity for violence. Jalal, a dream guide given visionary status by countertenor Tim Mead, trains him in spiritual disciplines. But though Varjak wins through in the end, it is not really clear what he has achieved.Partly it is the fault of Philips’s word setting, the single technical flaw in a work that is fluently and confidently scored. But the libretto tries to get too much in.More seriously, the music, despite some nods in the direction of jazz and musical theatre, fails to come up with memorable ideas. Gerry Cornelius conducts the efficient eight-piece band.Yet there is genuine entertainment in the brilliant urban designs of Rhys Jarman, wonderfully lit by Bruno Poet, and John Fulljames’ staging is inventive from start to finish. A small ball of energy on the stage, Akiya Henry delivers a star performance in the title role and the remainder of the cast works to good effect.

Judging by his 1651 Calisto, audiences enjoyed sex comedies even then.Though it has a standard mythological setting, with king of the gods Jove seducing the nymph Calisto to his wife Juno’s fury, the plot includes some wild goings on. Calisto is devoted to the goddess Diana, so Jove disguises himself as the goddess to offer her lesbian delights. Meanwhile, the supposedly chaste Diana is after pretty-boy shepherd Endimion. Elsewhere, a randy satire, tries to tempt an elderly nymph to let him pleasure her. Sex, in this opera, is everywhere.David Alden’s production, designed by Paul Steinberg (sets) and Buki Shiff (costumes), is recognisably from the same team that staged Monteverdi’s Poppea and Ulisse for WNO. The same propensity for brittle cynicism infuses all three, pushing serious elements out of the way. Stylishly visualised, the result is fun but ultimately sells the piece short.For this first ever Cavalli production at Covent Garden, the music is in the secure hands of conductor Ivor Bolton, even if he uses a pit band three times the size of the original. Strong standouts from a worthwhile cast include Sally Matthews’ game Calisto, Umberto Chiummo’s vigorous Jove and Lawrence Zazzo’s immaculately sung Endimion. But in a less cartoon-like production, maybe in the smaller Linbury, the piece would prove richer and more complex.

He capers absurdly round the stage and revels in a Little List of candidates for execution that would ideally include Simon Cowell’s boy band, designers of flat-pack furniture and miscreants on their mobile phones.The cast wear brilliant Japanese plumage, which was the original costume from Mike Leigh’s film Topsy Turvy. Not so happy, though, on the first night at Birmingham, was a design defect in the courtyard set which made the line of chorus members waiting to make their entrance distractingly visible from the dress circle.The Chorus of Men has a full-bodied sound that thrills. Jonathan Ansell as Nanki-Poo is inexperienced as an actor but makes an excellent job of the singing and is well paired with Gillian Ramm as a perky Yum-Yum. The comic timing of their madrigal with Pitti-Sing (Victoria Ward) and Pish-Tush (Michael Kerry) makes it very playful.Sylvester McCoy as the Mikado delivers the songs like speeches, in stentorian tones. Convincing performances come too from Gareth Jones as an impeccably aristocratic Pooh-Bah and from Nicola McAuliffe, who grows into the role of Katisha. She is as awkward and apologetic as a Joyce Grenfell creation, and the real affection that develops between her and Ko-Ko is endearing.Such well-known music strikes a happy chord. It just needs the company to gel together a little more and work not as individuals but as an ensemble.

The distressed plaster of Tanya McCallin’s sets reveal why Dr Bartolo needs to marry into his ward Rosina’s money – though the scene shift from the exterior of Bartolo’s house to the interior remains a touch clunky.Young conductor Rory Macdonald makes a highly competent ENO debut, even if he could occasionally bring it off with a little more flair. More obviously auspicious is Canadian John Tessier’s British debut as Count Almaviva – his effortlessly searing high tenor is thrillingly virile, and his words are delivered with laser-cut edges. The latter is also true of Anna Grevelius, making an important role debut as Rosina. She steers a course between naive romantic and feisty schemer, while skilfully negotiating all manner of vocal runs and decoration.Garry Magee’s Figaro warmed up quickly after a slightly apologetic Largo al factotum, but his words are more heavily masked than the rest of the cast. And then there’s Andrew Shore, one the country’s great character actor-singers. He’s the comic gemstone around which the whole cast revolves, and a clear source of energy.With ensemble scenes that are carefully escalated and at least three strikingly good singers, this production should help ensure that Miller’s Barber enjoys rude health into its adult life.

The evening’s chief merit is Edward Gardner’s conducting.Part of the problem with Cav lies in Ultz’s set, placing the action in a box representing a low-status fifties Italian eatery. It feels contrived and we gain nothing from the introduction of a new character, Turiddu’s brother. Sean O’Brien’s new translation sounds far more artificial than the old ones.Vocally, there’s a strong Alfio from Roland Wood, but while Peter Auty’s tone as Turiddu is glamorous, his Tweedledum costume undermines the Latin lover-boy impression. Jane Dutton’s Santuzza lacks intensity and vocal consistency.Pag goes better, the play within a play here a seventies sex comedy called Ding Dong performed by telly stars in a provincial theatre. Lee Hall’s new version has the merit of consistency, and Ultz’s sets are finely achieved, although moving them involves a lengthy hiatus.But some of the momentum that should carry the piece along is missing. Geraint Dodd’s strong tenor is an asset as Kenny (Canio) but his acting is a lost cause. Christopher Purves’ Tony has his cheesy mannerisms off pat, but vocally there’s no Italianate vigour. Mark Stone’s Woody (Silvio) shines and Mary Plazas’s Nelly (Nedda) is appreciable. But a Pagliacci where the real audience laughs at the violent denouement has gone wrong somewhere.

With the Royal Opera’s chorus and orchestra at the top of their game, one of Puccini’s most adventurous scores comes over as one of his greatest.This is a classic Royal Opera production, and Bond film designer Kenneth Adam’s lavish and realistic sets, originally created in 1977, still impress. Amazingly, two of the original participants return for this revival. Director Piero Faggioni secures a coherent and involving overview of this drama of redemption played out in the Wild West, with much fine detail on the way. Italian baritone Silvano Carroli is once again the loveless Sheriff Rance, his voice now past its best but his grandeur and focus unimpaired.Not from the 1977 team, Jose Cura is well known to London audiences as Dick Johnson, a role that fits him like a glove. As the bandit transformed by the love of a good woman, he is in sensational voice and a dominant and potent presence.New as the Girl of the Golden West is Eva-Maria Westbroek, who could do with an ounce more vocal heft but who wins all hearts with her sentient, comprehensive portrayal.A largely male home team provides an infallible set of miners and native Americans, each beautifully imagined and flawlessly created on stage.

Notwithstanding some obtuse designs by Maria Bjornson, including a doll-like madonna and a giant admonitory finger, Francesca Zambello’s production, first seen in 2002, is a sensual crowd-pleaser. With subtler intimacies left to fend for themselves, the denouement at least is spectacular, the flames of hell noisily engulfing what looks to be the bath house of a Roman villa. Earlier scenes are set in and around a variably positioned curved structure upon which the main protagonist clambers over athletically.Simon Keenlyside is back in the role, a great draw not least for thepatrons of 100-plus cinemas taking a live relay. Kyle Ketelsen’s experienced Leporello is scarcely less fine and young Robert Gleadow makes an unusually virile Masetto in a notable role debut for him. Eric Halfvarson is the solid Commendatore.Only the traditionally Italian voice and bearing of the Don Ottavio, Mexican tenor Ramon Vargas, doesn’t quite fit. The costumes, unlike the sets, are vaguely in period, the wigs unflattering.Marina Poplavskaya reprises her Donna Anna, a portrayal of restraint and regal bearing, well sung despite a throat infection. In a further pair of notable role debuts, Miah Persson offers considerable vocal charm and natural acting as a class-conscious Zerlina, while Joyce DiDonato adjusts her honeyed bel canto mezzo to project the desperation of a Donna Elvira costumed to resemble Miss Havisham.In the pit we are in experienced hands. Sparing with vibrato and eschewing refinement for refinement’s sake, Mackerras can seem determined to outpace his singers, yet he sanctions an unusually gentle and seductive La ci darem la mano – there’s always humanity as well as buoyancy in his approach.

The first act appears interesting – the entrance hall to a scientific laboratory complete with human skeleton, but it proves no place for forging a sword and results in a muddle despite tremendous singing.Stephen Gould looks an ideal Siegfried – big, bouncing and bullying – he makes no pretence of a gentler side to Siegfried’s character. Gerhard Siegel is an unusually tough Mime – their scenes together tend to be something of a shouting match, but exciting and amusing. Albert Dohmen’s Wanderer is somewhat overshadowed by the other two. He has not yet fully developed this last section of the Wotan role.Act II is scenically splendid – bare trees and the span of an apparent flyover bridge. Here the story unfolds with dramatic power from Siegfried, Wanderer, Mime, Alberich and no dragon but a voice – Fatfner.Finally, the other production fault – the scene where the Wanderer calls up Erda. This is one of the most important in the Ring, but here it is sung by Dohmen and Christa Mayer in front of a blank curtain. A mistake on all counts. For Brunnhilde’s awakening in the ruined castle courtyard Gould finds a fairly convincing, charming diffidence and still splendid voice. Linda Watson’s Brunnhilde is less happy, the voice often sounding forced. But Thielemann’s conducting holds all in glorious Wagner.

The second act is not so very inspiring, merely rocky, but the last act, the courtyard of a ruined fortress is immensely effective.Thielemann’s conducting again creates the opera’s unique mystery, through love and the hope of spring to disaster and pain. The first scene between Sieglinde, Siegmund and Hunding is really dramatic with Eva-Maria Westbroek’s vividly sung Sieglinde, Kwangchul Youn’s fine Hunding and Endrik Wottrich’s Seigmund now dramatically developed.One of the most exciting experiences at this performance was the full development of Albert Dohmen’s Wotan since last year. Now he gives real meaning and interest to Wotan’s long narration in Act II, and both his singing and acting are deeply moving in the final scene with Brunnhilde – Wotan’s farewell. Linda Watson is not an ideal Brunnhilde, but she sings and acts effectively.In general Bernd Skodzig’s costumes are excellent – timeless in the traditional Ring manner, but of course there are exceptions. The eight valkyries in their scarlet costumes weaving their way to and fro in the ruined fortress at the beginning of Act III make a splendidly exciting scene, but the red tunic-cum-dress is not helpful to Brunnhilde. Nor is the tight black costume and large black headdress good for Martina Dike’s Fricka.But the wholeness of music, performance and human joy and suffering leaves the audience deeply moved and passionately enthusiastic.

An official announcement regarding the future of the direction of the festivals is thought to be likely after the official Bayreuth Foundation meets on September 1. Wolfgang Wagner will be 89 years of age and it is generally hoped that his two daughters, half-sisters, Eva Wagner-Pasquier and Katharina Wagner will be appointed joint directors.Katharina has produced a number of operas but her debut on the festival stage was this Meistersinger last year. Now it returns for more careful assessment. It would have been very likely that she should want to present this opera – produced by her father a number of times with great success – in an entirely new way. This she has, with a vengeance.But the result is doubtful. She has turned the whole simple comedy upside down,  including the characters. Most fundamental is the change in Hans Sachs. The wise, warm-hearted, humorous shoemaker has become a rather pitiable character who controls nothing. In the last act he entertains Walther and Eva in his room of white walls and steel furniture. This is not followed by festival meadows. In front of a glass wall, a number of figures with huge heads and masks representing Richard Wagner among many others catch Sachs and rope him to a chair before dancing round and mocking him.There are many other bright ideas, but suffice it to say there is time for Katharina to achieve her father’s art and vision in production.Sebastian Weigle conducted with a heavy hand. Franz Hawlata does not really have a Sachs voice. At this performance he seemed to be singing under difficulties and won great sympathy. Klaus Florian Vogt has a really beautiful voice for Walther von Stolzing. The others did their best.

Rightly, for they and the marvellous acoustics form Wagner’s greatest treasure here.With Christian Thielemann conducting this is indeed a triumph.Gotterdammerung is a temptation for many producers to experiment with the ending. Tankred Dorst has been tempted in this way too. His first scene with the Norns is visually exquisite – the three singers in graceful, silvery costumes are gathered on a rock in front of a black night sky dotted with twinkling stars. After that, we return to the ruined castle where Brunnhilde was awakened.Then the problems begin with the Gibichungs’ Hall of stairs and balconies and steps. Is it a palace? A hotel? An expensive brothel? When Hagen calls up the vassals, out come dozens of men in dress suits and boiled shirts. The Gibichungs’ servants? But then women in evening dress join them, and waiters with trays of glasses.Individual performances, however, can overcome oddities of production, and there are several fine ones here. Stephen Gould’s Siegfried seemed vocally tireless, a fine heroic figure but lacking romance. Linda Watson’s Brunnhilde seemed to be singing under difficulties – some soft passages were beautiful, but for the most part the voice was strained. Hans-Peter Konig on the other hand has a magnificent bass voice, but his Hagen was more like a kindly Hans Sachs than the embittered bastard Gibichung brother. The legitimate Gibichungs however, Gunther (Ralf Lukas) and Gutrune (Edith Haller) sang and acted admirably, and Christa Mayer was a poignant Waltraute.

Tankred Dorst’s production, now in its third year, with sets by Frank Philipp Schlossmann and costumes by Bernd Skodzig equalled the music with clear, bright, semi-classical designs. The result is simple, timeless and allows Wagner’s drama as well as his music to hold the stage.Rheingold is a dramatic piece where the story unfolds, and Dorst is to be complimented on the way he gets his cast to act, and on beautiful and effective grouping. It is exciting to watch.Albert Dohmen is now developing into a fine Wotan, Arnold Bezuyen is a brilliant Loge, fine, strong voice and delightful acting. Andrew Shore is again a splendid Alberich.

The permanent set here represents the deck of a large pleasure steamer and is dotted with chairs. When Isolde is angry or frustrated, she throws the chairs about. Brangane picks them up, tidily. The new Isolde, Irene Theorin, has a handsome voice, but almost throughout this act presses it in a hard, narrow vibrato which sounds harsh, sometimes actually ugly. Brangane, played by Michelle Breedt, is not allowed much character and remains a troubled attendant.The second act is miraculously changed, thanks to two people – Peter Schneider, who conducts with real loving understanding of Wagner’s score, and Robert Dean Smith, who now sings Tristan with the true art of greatness. He seems to inspire Theorin, who sings the love duet with great beauty. Robert Holl sings King Marke with a noble tone but little emotion.In the third act, Tristan’s home in Brittany appears to be a hospital, and he is found on an adjustable bed on a small railed dais. This act is Tristan’s, and Dean Smith sings and acts it magnificently. When Isolde comes in, she looks rounds carelessly, sees Tristan dead on the floor and comes to him. When she has sung the Liebestod, she covers herself with a sheet.Did Marthaler really intend the story to end with this comic touch when the orchestra claims heart and mind with love’s death?

Harheim is tempted by adding some ‘ideas’, but emerges triumphant because this is simply a great musical performance.The producer’s idea here is expressed by setting the first act in an apparently stately home of the 19th century. This, like all the set designs by Heike Scheele and costumes by Gesine Vollm, is handsome and effective, if a little confusing. The second act should end with Klingsor’s downfall when Parsifal makes the sign of the cross with the sacred spear – now a magic gun destroys a scene smothered in swastikas.But the third act, rightly, brings peace and spiritual triumph. Gatti shows himself to be one of the finest Wagner conductors of the present day. Christopher Ventris, if not a great Parsifal, is a very good one. Mihoko Fujimura sing Kundry most beautifully. Detlef Roth is a fine Amfortas and Thomas Jesatko a good Klingsor. But it is Kwangchul Youn’s Gurnemanz that sets the seal of greatness on this production – strong, wise, infinitely tender. Can you remember Hans Hotter in this role?

Why?True, it contains no great ensembles, trios and quartets such as Neapolitan audiences had come to expect after Rossini’s previous five operas. Instead, the many solo scenes, arias and duets startlingly reflect the early evolution of Greek tragedy. Composer and librettist stick closely to their source, Racine’s Andromaque (1667). So, no happy ending either.Nor are there legion opportunities for outpourings of ‘bel canto’. Instead Rossini has woven it into the fabric of a brilliantly designed musical tapestry projecting the full force of the tragedy. Ermione finds the composer writing at the height of his powers.The festival production for the most part does him proud. Graziano Gregori’s classically conceived enclave with rising and falling levels sustains the score’s inexorable momentum, Guido Levi’s pale coloured washes of lighting mysteriously intensifying the fraught emotions of the principals.Daniele Abbado directs his cast to avoid tearing a passion to tatters. When they do explode, the effect is distressing. Sonia Ganassi’s Ermione, sister to Medea, deploys an astonishing vocal armoury to searing effect. Her fury during the Act I finale is hair-raising.Antonino Siragusa matches her note for note, his Orestes agonise and impassioned. Marianna Pizzolato, singing with warm, centred tone, suffers nobly as Andromaca, while Gregory Kunde creates a Pirro who is no mere tyrant. Vocally, he is sometimes stretched to the limits.Roberto Abbado conducts a taut reading which fully realises the score’s remarkable formal structure.

It remains a high point of the annual festival, not least because the youngsters’ technical prowess and seemingly innate feel for the composer’s stylistic demands puts to shame many an international star.This year’s cast gave an enviable display of ensemble acting which would grace any major opera house. Never was there a lapse in concentration, neither in their responses to dramatic events, nor in their scrupulous concern for musical values.They were undoubtedly helped by the young Russian conductor Denis Vlasenko, making his festival debut. His command of Rossinian style is formidable. He has a refined ear for instrumental textures and a sure sense of architecture. He paced the score admirably, was selfless in support of the singers.Notable amongst this year’s talented crop were Cristina Obregon, whose level-headed Corrina combined vocal purity with deftly underplayed comedic touches. Two outstanding tenors fearlessly traversed the staves, Yijie Shi’s Tigger-like Cavalier Belfiore contrasting well with Alexey Kudrya’s impassioned Conte di Libenskopf – he’d be a terrific Lensky.Marco Filippo Romano’s firm-toned Don Profondo was in the finest traditions of Italian buffo performance. Tamara Klivadenko brought to her toping Marchesa Melibea a warm mezzo and a sly wit.

What a surprise, therefore, to encounter Michael Hampe’s old-fashioned staging of Maometto II (1820), with its crystalline narrative unfolding – no distracting goings-on to deconstruct.Maometto is about the agonising dilemmas created by the tyrannical imperatives of love and duty to country. Rossini projects the resultant emotional conflicts via a series of heart-stopping, soul-searching trios, via striking accompanied recitative which often dramatically disrupts the conventional musical forms such as the aria with cabaletta.The personal crises are also woven into the fabric of the big narrative ensembles. The score is a miracle of musical architecture, whose inexorable momentum powers the tragedy.Chiara Donato’s costumes are colourful period. Alberto Andreis provides monumental settings in naturalistic mode. However, they sometimes necessitate the closure of the front curtain, which impedes momentum to the detriment of the score’s structural dynamic.Gustav Kuhn too conducts a reading which tends to sectionalise the score so that, for example, the remarkable Act I Terzettone, Ohime! Qual fulmine, was served up in bits. Rossini builds in integrated blocks.Despite such reservations, the production confirms Maometto as a masterpiece. And the fine cast do it proud. Francesco Meli’s weighty tenor, safe in passage work, catches the Venetian Commander Erisso’s stern morality. Marina Rebeka is a feisty Anna, whose tonal radiance and expressive ‘fioriture’ movingly reveal her inner torments.Daniella Barcellona’s warm and agile mezzo fits the compassionate Calbo like a glove. Only Michele Pertusi’s imposing Maometto is vocally over-parted.

So why revive it? Because two apologists, in their programme notes, press for an urgent reassessment of the librettist Gaetano Gasbarri’s scurrilous, at times surreal, text, universally blamed for the work’s failure and neglect.However, the 19-year-old Rossini’s score, if not vintage, has memorable moments aplenty, which bring subtlety and depth to character. The ingredients for success exist.Gasbarri’s plot has a servant duo enable young Ermanno to get his girl Ernestina, the bookish daughter of the bourgeois Gamberotto, who has betrothed her to the preening but wealthy Buralicchio. They convince the latter that Ernestina is a “castrato”.Sagi updates to c 2002. Gamberotto is a financially successful purveyor of fruit and veg, his warehouse and offices furnished with an expensive, brutalist vulgarity. So why his need to marry off Ernestina wealthily? How explain away the castrato con in a contemporary context?Worse still, Sagi presents Ernestina, from her first appearance dressed in hideous black plastic, as a sexual predator unlikely to care whom she marries, or beds, so her character cannot evolve and mature.However, neither the updating nor the change of setting offend so much as the director’s wilful disregard for Rossini’s and Gasbarri’s original. The apologists, of course, have nothing to say about the production.The travesty staging wastes a fine cast of singers, while indifferent conducting often results in murky textures and a hazardous rapport between pit and stage. A dispiriting evening.

The central character is Sierva Maria, a 12 year old girl bitten by a rabid dog and believed to be possessed. Placed in a convent, she is visited by a priest, Father Delaura, who becomes increasingly obsessed with her as her exorcism approaches.The heady operatic mixture of sex and religion offers the potential, at least, for an absorbing evening. Silviu Purcarete’s production, with designs by Helmut Sturmer, instils Latin American colour and an environment of decaying baroque splendour. The cast, led by Allison Bell’s febrile Sierva and Nathan Gunn’s tortured Delaura, works hard to create their eccentric and overwrought characters, caught up in a world of superstitious fantasy and burgeoning sexuality. The problem is the score, a thin and pallid achievement that does little more than create an atmospheric context. Never does it grab and hold the attention, as it should.Conductor Vladimir Jurowski and the London Philharmonic do everything possible with it, but Glyndebourne has backed the wrong horse on this occasion.

The Stravinsky is on first. Regina Wielingen’s upbeat abstract choreography is attractively realised, with some good ensemble work and some striking solos, though the score finds the City of London Sinfonia on lackadaisical form, with some surprising lapses in accuracy and ensemble.Both they and conductor Stuart Stratford seem transformed in the second half, where their committed playing and rich tone match the vocal glories onstage bar for thrilling bar. In sheer vocal quality, this has to be one of the finest shows the company has ever offered.Iolanta is the blind daughter of the medieval King Rene, who miraculously recovers her sight through the impact of love. In the title role, Orla Boylan finds subtlety and delicacy within her ample lyric soprano. As the nobleman Vaudemont, who stumbles into her domain and falls in love with her, Peter Auty sings impeccably and with ardent tone. Mikhail Svetlov’s King Rene engages movingly both with the drama and the music. Mark Stone’s Robert, Toby Stafford-Allen’s Arab doctor Ibn-Hakia and all the smaller roles fulfil every demand.Nicky Shaw’s designs conjure an enclosed garden in the forest where Iolanta is kept hidden from the world and Annilese Miskimmon’s staging charts every point in the unfolding story with unerring skill. The production reveals the opera as a neglected masterpiece.

It has six meaty roles for principals, lots of work for chorus, and a substantial ballet sequence. A traditional staging in a major opera house would probably run to grandiose sets highlighting its 17th-century Venetian setting.Yet Holland Park, with only a fraction of the budget La Scala would throw at it, makes a decent job of rising to at least some of its biggest challenges. Martin Lloyd-Evans’ production, a curious throwaway ending to the second-act curtain apart, takes the high-flown manner of the original seriously and gives its extravagant melodrama emotional reality. Jamie Vartan’s designs describe a sinister, hemmed-in city-state, bent on pleasure as a way of diverting attention from surveillance and repression. Only the well-known Dance of the Hours intermezzo fails to strike an appropriate visual identity.Not all of the participants quite hit the spot. Vadim Zaplechny’s Enzo has a mixed night vocally and is dramatically at sea. Yvonne Howard is surprisingly ineffective as Laura. Nuala Willis makes something of the heroine’s blind mother, though her singing is idiosyncratic.But Gweneth-Ann Jeffers understands the scale and meaning of the title role, even if her vocalism cannot meet every one of Ponchielli’s demands, while both David Soar’s Alvise and Olafur Sigurdarson’s Barnaba are first-rate. Peter Robinson supplies capable rather than dynamic conducting. All in all, a brave attempt at one of Italian opera’s biggest assignments.

Joel Adam’s lighting makes the forest scene utterly enchanting. The witch’s cottage is a nutritionist’s nightmare – a mammoth pile of the kind of food and drink kids love, but shouldn’t.Pelly’s touch is less sure with the magical visions. Neither the Sandman nor the Dew Fairy, excellently sung though they are by Amy Freston and Malin Christensson respectively, are visually more than plastic-tinselly.The children in white who replace Humperdinck’s 14 angels are an uncertain quantity, while the chorus of obese kids who come on at the end, while logical enough, are a touch un-PC.But you’ll never see or hear a better Hansel and Gretel than Jennifer Holloway and Adriana Kucerova, while the two parents – Irmgard Vilsmaier’s Mother and Klaus Kuttler’s Father – are strong, and Wolfgang Ablinger-Sperrhacke’s comic-grotesque witch enormous fun.

The book comes from Elmer Rice’s Pulitzer Prize-winning play about life in and around a New York tenement, where various families of different ethnic backgrounds interact.Comedy intersperses with tragedy; the central character, Elena Ferrari’s vibrant Anna Maurrant, is shot by her brutal husband Frank, presented in a formidable performance by Andrew Slater, after an affair with Paul Featherstone’s shifty Sankey.Meanwhile her daughter Rose, sung by Ruby Hughes, fails to get it together with neighbour Sam Kaplan, played by Adrian Dwyer, and eventually goes off to start a new life elsewhere.The Young Vic’s acoustics don’t help performers, and diction is not what it should be. But Dick Bird’s set cleverly integrates stage with orchestra, and both the band and Patrick Bailey’s musical direction are first rate.There’s much to enjoy, too, in John Fulljames’s detailed, lively production, even if it can’t override some faults in the piece itself, including an over-long first act.

This is its 21st outing in 34 years and the audience plainly loves its comfortable clutter. No matter that there’s perhaps too little sense of the protagonists’ poverty and that Mimi’s illness will worsen if she stays with Rodolfo.Two intervals are required to cope with Julia Trevelyan Oman’s sumptuous representational sets. Nicole Cabell is effectively making her Covent Garden debut – having previously appeared with the company in concert. While her voice isn’t large, it is beautifully focused and her hyperactive Musetta gives the fun-loving vamp a neurotic edge. She looks gorgeous too.Matthew Rose’s Colline is vocally impregnable, while Roderick Williams’ eccentric Schaunard is adroitly acted, if smaller in scale. As Marcello, Franco Vassallo is efficient and authentic in another house debut.Bravely performing with a damaged knee and supporting himself with a stick, Roberto Aronica provides bags of Italian fervour as Rodolfo. His rather strenuous vocal production offers less in the way of subtlety, but brings the house down.For all her experience in the role, Cristina Gallardo-Domas remains problematic as Mimi. There are moments of grace and poignancy and she dies with conviction, yet the unintentionally strident episodes can grate.In a sense the evening belongs to Copley who, despite the impaired mobility of his leading man, secures the kind of detailed ensemble acting and teeming naturalistic detail rarely encountered in a revival. Catch the old war horse while it’s still going strong, with Christian Badea eliciting a full-blooded response in the pit.

Perhaps this is partly the result of one of the show’s weaker elements, the conducting of Thomas Ades, which needs more dynamism. The show doesn’t maintain enough momentum.That said, there is still a great deal to enjoy, especially in the lively visuals of Carl Fillion’s sets and Francois Barbeau’s costumes, which evoke the Las Vegas and Hollywood of the opera’s 1951 premiere with wit and style, and in a generally excellent cast.Charles Castronovo supplies the youth and good looks to make him a credible innocent abroad and sings with some finesse. He’s perfectly partnered by Sally Matthews’s pristine Anne Trulove, whose Act I aria is a highlight and who retains sympathy all evening.Darren Jeffery does not register sufficiently as her concerned but mildly authoritarian father and John Relyea’s Nick Shadow could do with more charisma. But Patricia Bardon’s Baba the Turk somehow finds humanity within her over-the-top personality, Kathleen Wilkinson’s Mother Goose looks well capable of running a brothel, and Peter Bronder’s auctioneer Sellem is dapper and fun.

A wire fence separates the drab, industrial cigarette factory from the soldiers’ guardroom in Act I and a plain, crumbling wall presents the exterior of the bullring in Act IV. McVicar’s brutal deglamorisation of the settings bring the characters’ passions, jealousies and anxieties into sharper focus, but with Act II’s cramped, dimly-lit underground tavern and an especially dark, misty smugglers’ den in Act III, the effect seems relentless.There’s plenty of colour, though, in Tania Kross’ Carmen. She uses her physical stature to create an entirely uninhibited, passionate and domineering lover, to the extent that her Don Jose gets somewhat slapped about. Defiant until her grisly end, there’s never a sense of her being a victim – only that she has resolutely defended her philosophy of freedom. Brandon Jovanovich as Don Jose sings with fervour and convincingly portrays a confused man consumed with jealousy. Wayne Tigges is a smooth, rather than exuberant, Escamillo, and if Kate Royal fails to make us warm to the rejected Micaela, in Act III she sings absorbingly.The quartet of smaller roles – Frasquita and Mercedes (sung by Jael Azzaretti and Katherine Rohrer) and the brigands Le Dancaire and Le Remendado (Richard Mosley-Evans and Loic Felix) is well cast. But the highlight is the conductor Stephane Deneve, who makes a thrilling Glyndebourne debut, combining bracing detail with supple pacing.Despite a tightly-coiled stand-off between Carmen and Don Jose at the opera’s climax, this production doesn’t quite lift off the stage. But it’s worth catching for Kross’ daringly coarse Carmen and the brilliant playing in the pit.

Instead of the action opening in the Baroque interior of Rome’s Sant’Andrea della Valle, we have its rundown façade. In the second act, Scarpia takes his supper in the same café, rather than in his palatial apartment. And, at the end, the jailed Cavaradossi is fired upon not at the Castel Sant’Angelo, but slumped inside a rusting Fiat.The time is 1968 (not 1800), a period of elections as the fly-posters suggest, and the chief of police Scarpia’s campaign message of order and morality is sometimes symbolically overplastered with publicity for the diva Tosca’s forthcoming performance. The updating creates one or two awkward plot-holes, but Barlow succeeds in refreshing the story, and the cast rally round impressively to strengthen the effect. Seán Ruane’s Cavaradossi is dramatically convincing and vocally heroic, though he doesn’t have the Italianate ring to lift the sound. He works well with his Tosca, Amanda Echalaz, who inhabits the role entirely without artifice. From her first, striking appearance, in bright yellow dresscoat and white knee-length boots, to her grief-stricken suicide, she portrays a rounded character, feisty but totally in love, and her singing effortlessly mirrors her emotions. Sharp-suited Nicholas Garrett makes a stunning Scarpia. Vocally he is perhaps a touch too smooth, but he carries his lean, athletic frame with potent menace and magnetism. His attempt to subjugate Tosca in Act 2 comes with an undertone of violence that is theatrically incendiary. As, too, is Tosca’s end – but that’s a surprise.

New York City Opera recently revived Hal Prince’s production, and it was done as the opening concert of last year’s Edinburgh International Festival.In these settings, with the benefit of full orchestra and chorus, its ravishing score can be given full musical justice, but also its Peer Gynt-like story of a strenuous moral journey across continents that its title character goes on and the multiplying physical and personal disasters that he encounters along the way, doesn’t seem so out of place.Stephen Sondheim, who contributed new lyrics in one of the many attempts to “fix” this famously troubled show, once said that a musical becomes an opera when it is done in an opera house in front of an opera audience. Robert Carsen’s new production duly works as such because that audience is better used to dealing with both its narrative extremes as well as the high-concept solution that the director provides, with his designer Michael Levine offering a giant fifties TV screen to literally frame it within.It becomes at once a definably period piece, with references to the McCarthy era that it was partly written in response to, but Carsen’s constantly witty and inventive production also produces its own contemporary interpretative interventions, taking a credit with Ian Burton for “freely adapting” Hugh Wheeler’s original book to explicitly relocate it within the embrace of America from the fifties to the present day.It may still the case that they are trying to fix the unfixable, and inevitably they occasionally go too far – the heart-renderingly beautiful optimism of the finale choral anthem, Make My Garden Grow, is undermined by being sung against video footage of yet more unfolding disasters where, thanks to global warming, that may be a forlorn hope rather than a promise.But ENO has cast it splendidly, with Toby Spence and Anna Christy making an appealing (and gorgeously sung) pair as Candide and his lover Cunegonde respectively. Beverley Klein, returning to the role of Old Lady that she previously played in the National Theatre version, holds her own in operatic company, and Alex Jennings – who took over as Professor Higgins during the West End run of My Fair Lady – is a remarkably assured and accomplished musical actor as Voltaire and Pangloss.

As with many fairy tales, the plot includes elements that seem scarcely suitable for children. Here, the water sprite Rusalka is in love with a human Prince who visits the forest lake where she lives. In order to acquire a human soul and human form – Anne-Sophie Duprels is initially presented as the full mermaid in McDonald’s brilliantly designed costumes – she undergoes a barbarous operation at the hands of the witch Jezibaba that leaves her with bloody legs to stumble around on. Her other loss is the power of speech, making her a literally dumb spectator at the feast where the hyper-sophisticated Foreign Princess of Janis Kelly fascinates her beloved Prince. It all ends badly, of course, both for Rusalka and her doomed Prince.But on the way we have a score of transcendent lyrical beauty, marvellously played by the English Chamber Orchestra under the careful baton of Stephen Barlow, while McDonald’s production, fitted out with some intricate movement by Lucy Burge, provides an experience of dark, yet genuine, enchantment.Strong work from the principals, too, though Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts is clearly taxed by the heavy role of the Prince. But Duprels makes a riveting Rusalka, vocally and dramatically, with Anne-Marie Owens a malign witch and Clive Bayley a menacing merman. It’s a remarkable evening, and Grange Park’s second major success this season.

Surrounded by a large gilt frame, the show looks handsome enough.What it lacks is a clear sense of focus in the central characterisations. Vocally too, things could be better. Robert Murray’s slouching posture in the opening scenes scarcely suggests the optimism of the confident young Tom Rakewell, ready to take on London, and his singing is bumpy, with too much of the role shouted instead of being sung scrupulously, with Mozartian delicacy. Sinead Campbell’s Anne has some wavery moments in her big Act I aria and a tendency to lose tonal quality at the ends of phrases. Stephen Richardson sings decently as Trulove, although he gives little sense of the prosperous middle-class father concerned about his potential son-in-law’s prospects. He’s amiably genial rather than an authority figure. Susan Bickley’s Baba is colourless in a role that above all demands personality. Even the normally excellent Christopher Purves offers little suggestion of the demonic in his competent but scarcely riveting Nick Shadow.Martin Andre’s conducting could do with more precision and attack. Overall a disappointing realisation of one of the 20th century’s greatest operas.

The Linbury stage becomes a vast staircase down which one expects Las Vegas showgirls to step. Giant-sized items of make-up are strewn about. An enormous compact opens to reveal the central character of Philip Hensher’s mordantly satirical libretto – the Duchess. Her louche life and very public downfall are drawn from the career of Margaret, Duchess of Argyll, whose husband divorced her in 1963 on the grounds of adultery, in what was a notoriously scandalous case.In Carlos Wagner’s vividly parodistic production, the opera once again impresses with its virtuosic orchestral writing, strongly played by the Southbank Sinfonia under Timothy Redmond, its sheer colour, and its dynamic energy. But one is left with the feeling that even with such an appealing protagonist as Joan Rodgers, there’s not enough humanity to spare much compassion for the Duchess’s dire situation. Rebecca Bottone (top register gleaming brilliantly), Alan Ewing and Iain Paton double, triple and even quadruple up as the various staff and servants, friends and journalists, who mock and condemn her as an ageing scarlet woman. Ewing is particularly impressive as her dyspeptic husband and the overbearing Judge. The result is brilliantly amusing though ultimately a little heartless. The production’s only real fault is a general and – given the size of the venue – deplorable weakness in diction.

Set in ancient Persia, it details the rivalry of the innocent Statira and the machinating Argene, the two daughters of the dead King Cyrus, both determined on marrying the conquering King Dario. Two other suitors – one of them conspicuously attached elsewhere – and even their elderly tutor, vie for their affections.The plot’s comic and tragic elements are closely interweaved and there are dozens of arias, many of them attractive. They demand the highest vocal skills, which they receive here only intermittently, although Paul Nilon’s Dario, Renata Pokupic’s Statira and Sophie Bevan’s Alinda all register impressively. Laurence Cummings conducts an expert period-instrument band, though he could search out more character in the music.Designer Dan Potra’s costumes mix periods and his moveable unit set outlines the formality of the Persian court. Director David Freeman keeps the show on the move and articulates the plot skilfully, but finds it difficult to strike an appropriate tone for the tragic-comic piece. Some of the business invented to accompany the arias is distracting. The result is a mixed but often interesting evening.

But here, using the edition he made for Modena in 1886, when it was sung in Italian, they score on everything else.Designed by Bob Crowley, Nicholas Hytner’s production is cogent and detailed, a succession of close-ups of the central characters within the grander panorama of religious conflict and political intransigence centred on the court of Philip II of Spain. The Catholic Church, responsible for the brutality of the Inquisition, comes off particularly badly, as Verdi meant it to, but the people, whooping on the burning of the heretics, don’t escape either.All the main performers distinguish themselves, though Rolando Villazon’s Carlos sometimes sounds stressed and even out of tune. It’s a role too big for his lyric tenor. Simon Keenlyside is almost beyond praise in the excellence of his singing and concentrated acting, even revealing that Posa’s idealism leads him to exploit the vulnerable prince. Ferruccio Furlanetto’s Philip is a complex, secretly lonely tyrant. Sonia Ganassi is a flamboyantly intelligent Eboli. Eric Halfvarson’s Grand Inquisitor is a combination of decrepitude and malevolence. Artfully sung though Marina Poplavskaya’s Elisabeth is, the top of her voice lacks bloom and her portrayal remains cold.Still, it’s a mightily impressive evening for chorus and orchestra, and Antonio Pappano once again demonstrates his mastery of Verdian musical drama.

That’s mistake number one. The new lyrics are dull, the new dialogue flatter than Norfolk. Some quite lengthy scenes pass by with scarcely a titter.The second mistake is to try to link the legendary serial wife-killer with Ian Fleming’s 007, which provides the occasion for lots of Bond imagery on stage, Bond franchise references heavily riveted on to the text, and a quartet of dancing scuba divers. It’s a pointless and again unfunny addition to the piece and frankly looks pretty desperate.A shame, because with Bond junked and the script replaced this would have the makings of a half-decent show. There’s nothing wrong with the cast.Philip Langridge takes to the title role as to the manner born, looking relaxed and debonair and singing with charm. There’s an amiable singing Clarrie Grundy-type from Elena Ferrari as village tart Boulotte, and a superbly vain King Bobeche from Rob Burt. Janis Kelly partners him ably as his roving-eyed wife, Clementine. Fun too are Fleurette and Daphnis, the young couple of rural swains, played by Yvette Bonner and Eamon Mulhall – who turn out to be royal. But the revamped script sinks them too.George Souglides’ designs are enjoyable but some of Will Tuckett’s dance routines need more precision, and Richard Balcombe’s correct conducting lacks spirit.

In the title role of Minnie, Belasco’s Girl of the Golden West, Cynthia Makris draws a finely vocalised portrait of a lonely woman who seizes her chance when romance comes along.She’s capably partnered by John Hudson, in ringing voice as the bandit Dick Johnson, who turns his life around under her loving influence.As the bitter sheriff left out of the picture when Minnie and Johnson head for happiness elsewhere, Olafur Sigurdarson is dark and dramatically powerful.The many smaller roles are realised in a whole collection of flawless portrayals.Rory Macdonald conducts, drawing superior playing from the English Chamber Orchestra and riveting the audience to the backs of their seats.

The stage set remains the same for the Act II town house of the ‘two-penny noble’ Faninal, and also for the seedy Act III hotel in which Baron Ochs receives his comeuppance. It’s a move that frustratingly flattens the social hierarchy, but the cast – and the musical direction under Edward Gardner – covers well for this weakness.Vocally, Janice Watson is a lyrical treat as the Marschallin – although she fails to make the heartache, nor gives full poignancy to her selfless act of guiding her toyboy Octavian into the arms of the young Sophie. All the remaining characters are deftly drawn, with Sarah Connolly suitably heroic in the trouser role of the young Octavian – exuberant in the confidence of youth – and Sarah Tynan looking the vision of purity, and with vocal eloquence to match, while adamant not to be poked around as a piece of bridal flesh. John Tomlinson excels as Baron Ochs, presenting a study of a nobleman whose grooming is constantly dented by his congenital propensity to chase the girls. The manner in which his self-important confidence expands to inhabit Faninal’s entire dwelling in Act II is a theatrical tour de force.Edward Gardner occasionally overplays what is in places a very dense score, but he inspires truly exciting playing from the ENO orchestra, ensuring the waltzes are honeyed but not cloying, but also impressing on us the music’s physicality.

Once again the result is a notable success. Richard Hudson’s sets are spare but strikingly atmospheric, evoking early 19th century rural Russia and St Petersburg with the lightest of touches.A mainly young central cast presents the drama with concentrated perception. Though Maria Kovalevska is unusually contained as Tatyana, she sings every note with conviction and partners Ales Jenis’ sombre Onegin with skill. He shows the sophisticated but emotionally empty hero’s flaws in a performance that is imaginatively acted, suggesting that his veneer of command and self-control is only skin deep.As the poet Lensky, Massimo Giordano delivers an outstanding account of his famous aria just before the fatal duel, a feat equalled by Mikhail Schelomianski as Prince Gremin, whose brief appearance in the final act is another highlight of superior vocalism at the service of the drama. Ably sketched in are the smaller roles – Adrian Thompson as an amiably pompous Monsieur Triquet, Marie McLaughlin as the concerned Madame Larina and Kathleen Wilkinson as Tatyana’s aged nurse.The score comes over powerfully, although conductor Vladimir Jurowski’s devoted attention to every last subtle detail in Tchaikovsky’s writing does occasionally impede its sheer dynamism and excitement. But it’s immaculately played by the London Philharmonic.

Using Tom Piper’s uncluttered design, which helps bring this into the Victorian era, Hill has found motivating factors which give the opera a basis in realism. Piper’s other piece of excellent design work is his incorporation of antlers into the set, ensuring the cuckold’s horns remain at the heart of the piece.Peter Sidhom makes a rumbustious Falstaff. There’s a warm strength to his voice and he creates a character who is quite capable of bouncing back, no matter what Windsor’s merry wives throw at him. Sally Burgess proves herself quite his equal, vocally and in wit, as a lively Mistress Quickly as she sets him up with her mistresses. Leah-Marian Jones and Maria Costanza Nocentini as Meg Page and Alice Ford have a sauciness about them, particularly in the Act II bedroom scene.While all the comedy is being played out, Lucy Crowe and Federico Lepre provide brilliant romantic relief as the lovers, Nannetta Ford and Fenton. They find and relish the soaring beauty in their recurring duets, while using Hill’s direction to ensure that the audience is in no doubt about their intentions for each other.Hill and Piper do not make the mistake of going for out-and-out theatrical glory in the final witching scene in Windsor Forest, which bursts on to the stage through the rest of the scenery. While this makes the ending seem slightly prosaic, it ensures that the storytelling is paramount.

Nor does Haim characterise or galvanise the music with consistent attack.Robert Carsen’s modern-dress production is strong on bringing out the ironies of the piece – in which Nero’s lover Poppea triumphs in her rise to power, while the two of them trample over everyone in their way – although a visual obsession with red velvet curtains in Michael Levine’s sets seems mysteriously limiting. At times, the cast seems to be performing the show to an onstage Glyndebourne audience. Monteverdi’s masterpiece has far wider resonances than that.A number of the individual performances – the three allegorical figures of the prologue, Paolo Battaglia’s Seneca and Tamara Mumford’s Ottavia – lack vocal or dramatic weight, although the latter is an expressive performer. Both the comic nurses – delivered by Dominique Visse and Wolfgang Ablinger-Sperrhacke – are finely drawn in, and the two central roles – Alice Coote’s wilful Nero, and Danielle de Niese’s sex kitten Poppea – are brilliantly realised dramatically and sung with imagination. They, at least, are fully in focus, but what surrounds them is regularly less assured.

This brand new production of Gounod’s Romeo and Juliette is tense, sharply defined and really quite sexy.Bernarda Bobro as Juliette enchants and captivates. She sustains the intensity of her solos with admirable control. Her soaring, passionate soprano is complemented by the virile and often heroic tones of Leonardo Capalbo’s Romeo in their extended duets. Both singers look agreeably young enough to play these parts.   Just when the production is seeming floor bound, Juliette steps on to a dais and the dais is raised quite high to become her bedroom. Excellent balance is another of Bobro’s skills. This becomes even more apparent when she and Capalbo are on her bed. The lovers are in white, she sporting Baz Luhrmann wings, in the monochrome and often gloomy design of Johan Engels. Much else is black and steely blue except for certain splashes of colour. Mercutio is allowed a heavy red coat and Stephano spray paints in red. Frere Laurent marries the lovers on the dais, which has been lowered and covered with lime green, knee high grass.The fighting scene is thrillingly staged in a walled thoroughfare with a wide expanse of white where there should be sky. That expanse is gradually reduced in height as the bodies are taken away.Peter Savidge as Juliette’s father makes a strong contribution. An interesting characterisation has Juliette’s nurse, here played by Yvonne Howard, as a voluptuous, eye-winking type who could pull a decent pint.The Opera North chorus reacts impressively to the drama and the company’s orchestra sets an inspiring emotional tone.

Paul Brown’s Act I church set is clogged up with railings and a complex staircase arrangement that get in the way, but his Act III execution ground on the top of Castel Sant’Angelo is strikingly atmospheric. The comings and goings in the complex narrative are handled well, with notable cameo appearances by Enrico Fissore’s Sacristan and Hubert Francis’ Spoletta fitting neatly into the bigger picture.New to the Royal Opera is Micaela Carosi, whose Tosca is a respectable piece of work, lyrically voiced and ably acted, though she never seizes the audience’s attention as she should.Paolo Gavanelli’s roughneck Scarpia is at times coarsely delivered and there is none of the subtlety of a sadistic yet sophisticated aristocrat that is the essence of the role.Both of them are unlucky in coming up against one of today’s leading young tenors at the peak of his form. Jonas Kaufmann not only sings Cavaradossi with distinction and imagination, but gives an acting performance in which every detail of the character and his situation is revealed. This revival will be remembered above all for his participation.But Antonio Pappano’s conducting is of an equal standard, fluid and authoritative, highlighting the peaks and troughs of Puccini’s emotional roller coaster with perception.

In what is basically a unit set by John Gunter, the darkness of the drama is suggested though there is little sense of any exterior locations. Gestures and acting tend to come from stock, with hardly any of the central performances rising to three-dimensional reality.An exception must be made for Lucio Gallo’s finely achieved representation of the title role, which he sings magnificently and explores in depth. As yet he still has some distance to go with one of Verdi’s most developed creations, but greatness lies within his reach. As his opponent Fiesco, Ferruccio Furlanetto is vocally presentable, but not the dark-hearted match for Boccanegra’s steadily increasing wisdom and generosity.German soprano Anja Harteros makes her Covent Garden debut as Amelia. She looks fine and sings creditably, but shows little detailed awareness of her character’s constantly evolving situation. Marcus Haddock fields plenty of strong tone as her lover, Adorno, but dramatically he offers no more than a stand and deliver performance. Marco Vratogna produces some of the venom and malice required for the treacherous Paolo.It’s not enough to suggest the greatness and subtlety of the work, which is one of Verdi’s finest, and though conductor John Eliot Gardiner shows a feeling for the score’s muted colouring, there’s no Verdian fire and fury in his belly either.

James Laing’s Oberon could do with some extra vocal heft, but he and Jeni Bern’s scintillating Titania command the stage and their magical kingdom. Tom Walker’s able-bodied Puck provides a virtuoso piece of movement.Some productions fail to clarify the changing relationships between the lovers. Not here, where every shift and turn makes an impact, and each of the four – Elizabeth Atherton’s Helena, Frances Bourne’s Hermia, Peter Wedd’s Lysander and Mark Stone’s Demetrius – registers clearly as an individual.The troupe of mechanicals, led by Henry Waddington’s Bottom, and taking in a brilliant collection of comic cameos, strut their stuff to perfection. The Pyramus and Thisbe parody is a brilliantly achieved interlude of visual wit and fresh variations on an old theme.But two of the main contributions stand out as raising the evening to the heights. One is the designs of Johan Engels (sets) and Ashley Martin-Davis (costumes), a psychedelic sixties extravaganza, wonderfully lit by Bruno Poet. They are entrancing. So is the music-making as a whole, every note given character and definition by the marvellous orchestra of Opera North under conductor Stuart Stratford. A superb evening.

His skilful traditional production is certainly preferable to some daft, conceptual rethink and picks up pace as it goes – though not every element is quite in place as yet.Deirdre Clancy’s elegant Belle Epoque costumes certainly fit the bill. Tim Reed’s sets, though, look skimpy, at least until the final act, with the recreation of Chez Maxim at the Pontevedrin Embassy. The choreography, by Anthony van Laast and Nicola Treherne, is pleasing and decently performed, though without the requisite verve until Act III, when things finally take flight.But Amanda Roocroft, both vocally and dramatically, has a clear idea of Hanna Glawari from the word go, bringing warmth and charm to everything she does. John Graham-Hall’s Danilo can’t match her in that respect – he lacks the charisma and sexiness the male lead demands.Those factors are certainly present in Alfie Boe’s Camille, vocally resplendent and winningly performed, and he’s ably partnered by Fiona Murphy’s Valencienne.Richard Suart buzzes around busily as Baron Zeta and Roy Hudd is a fund of likeable invention as Njegus – his third-act song, culled from the first London production of 1907, is a highlight.Yet somehow the show feels slow on its feet and Oliver von Dohnanyi’s conducting doesn’t exactly kick it into life.

Verdi’s early Macbeth shows the young composer extending the possibilities of harmony, form and orchestration in a thrilling yet dark and probing score. With Opera North’s orchestra and chorus on top form, and music director Richard Farnes in the pit, this is a world-class interpretation that displays all the might and psychological richness of the score.Tim Albery’s production, designed by Johann Engels (sets) and Brigitte Reiffenstuel (costumes) matches it well. The period is modern though not specific – Macbeth’s tyranny has been echoed all too often in recent decades. The chorus of witches are cleaning ladies, observing the action as well as intervening at crucial points. The appearance of the dead Banquo at the banquet is suitably shocking.The opera is finely sung, with Peter Auty’s Macduff excelling in vocal prowess. Robert Hayward’s usurper could do with more light and shade, though he’s on the right lines. Antonia Cifrone discloses a keen dramatic presence and knows her way around the notes. Ernesto Morillo Hoyt’s Banquo is effective if a touch on the small side vocally.But it’s an exciting evening as a whole. Many young opera-goers in this audience were there as part of Opera North’s educational work and, judging from the reception, this show proves a great experience for operatic novices and old hands alike.

Amid the nobles masquerading as shepherds, the supposedly unrequited love among the two main couples, the eavesdropping, the provocation of petty jealousies and the waywardly delivered tokens of affection, the four main protagonists manage finally to find love, and Atalanta and Meleagro’s royal marriage is feted – reflecting the occasion for which the opera was written.Christopher Cowell’s production gets up the cast as scruffy teenagers, with Irene and a young-mother pal in chavvy velour hooded tracksuits. There’s plenty of strutting and eyeball-rolling, texting and “yeah, whatever” facial expressions. If that’s not enough, the hunt, in which Atalanta is victorious, takes place in a video arcade – boar-slaying for the Wii generation. Act two opens on the beach amid bottles of Corona and polystyrene take-away boxes, and Mercury appears in the last act as the cheesy-slick host of a makeover programme – during which Atalanta and Meleagro are decked up in their wedding attire. It’s all perceptively done and if in the process the piece is sometimes led down a blind alley, the result is genuinely humorous, distinctive and well-suited to what is by necessity a low-budget production.The singing is generally of a high standard, with a vocally brilliant (and suitably athletic-looking) Atalanta, sung by Ruby Hughes, and an equally impressive Madeleine Pierard, who, in the trouser-role of Atalanta’s lover, Meleagro, never erred from her masculine gait. Irene – a shepherdess, but here chav queen, is perhaps the most alert actor, with constantly reinvented physical expression, and has a rich, dependable mezzo-soprano. With Laurence Cummings in the pit, this is a strongly successful revival of a Handel rarity.

With their circus paraphernalia and grotesque facial appendages, Giles Cadle’s designs stress the piece’s stated antecedents in popular puppet theatre, deriving ultimately from the Italian commedia dell’arte – Andrew Shore’s rude, leering Punch is a nastier distant cousin to Canio in Pagliacci – while Peter Mumford’s lighting is brilliant at changing our emotional perceptions of a scene at the flick of a switch.In any case there are lots of different ways of presenting a masterpiece, which the opera increasingly looks like being – Edward Gardner’s engaged conducting and superior playing from the ENO musicians certainly see to that.And this is a first-rate cast, with Shore’s half-disgusting, half-pathetic creation rightly holding centre stage, while surrounded by Lucy Schaufer’s comic-grotesque Judy, Gillian Keith’s mesmerisingly ditzy Pretty Polly, Ashley Holland’s stern Choregos, and Graham Clark and Graeme Broadbent’s impeccable double-act as the Lawyer and the Doctor. Whether Punch really needs his group of mimicking mimes is open to question, although they execute Quinny Sacks’ choreography with alacrity. The piece fascinates once again.

His new large-scale opera has as its centre the legendary figure of the Minotaur, half-man, half-bull, trapped in the Labyrinth in Crete and there the killer of innumerable sacrificial victims.He’s a surprisingly sympathetic creation in David Harsent’s libretto and in John Tomlinson’s presentation of the semi-beast – victim as well as killer, only able to articulate his humanity in dreams.Tomlinson’s wide-ranging performance is surrounded by others in Stephen Langridge’s disciplined production, to spare yet resonant designs by Alison Chitty. Christine Rice is the Minotaur’s half sister Ariadne, desperate to escape the island home she sees as her own prison. The visiting Theseus, Ariadne’s means of escape, is strongly presented by Johan Reuter.But it’s above all in the scenes of ritual and violence that the staging hits hardest – the desperate Innocents, sent as tribute to Crete, butchered in the Labyrinth, and the terrifying Keres, the harpies who devour their dead bodies. Vocally and dramatically, Amanda Echalaz’s appearance as the leader of this grisly team is nothing short of sensational. Potent too the scene where Ariadne consults the oracle of the Snake Princess, sung by Andrew Watts, through the medium of Philip Langridge’s high priest.The score’s splintered lyricism and thrusting textures are presented with detailed focus by the chorus and orchestra under Antonio Pappano, and leave an overwhelming impression.

Searching for the truth, he journeys into the mountains to meet the mysterious Old Mountain Dweller, but is captured and sentenced to death for treason. The last scene presents the final scene of the previously interrupted Chinese opera, which shows a different and far more positive ending.It’s a piece that plays with the audience’s expectations while keeping them entertained, notably by some brilliant versions of Chinese folk music and a parody of Italian opera in the aria of Marco Polo.Lee Blakeley’s pacey production, with intricate and witty designs by Jean-Marc Puissant, and the strong cast, many of whom double up, present highly individual characterisations. The opera-within-an-opera is a comic tour-de-force, but the show also makes you think – about truth and fiction, fate, and both ancient and modern China. Immediately accessible and yet thought-provoking, this is one of the finest British operas of recent times. Sian Edwards conducts with sensitivity and vitality.

The score also uses a good deal of live electronics. There are some stick-out quotations and a broad impact of modernist devices alongside other passages closer to ambient music. It’s a mish-mash and, worse, a forgettable one. Far too much of it is little more than background.What it adds to Lynch’s concept is debatable. The film’s deliberate ambiguities and shifts of identity are repeated in a libretto that cuts down the screenplay while being largely faithful to it. That the result is hard to follow may be the point, but a clearer directional frame would have helped. In Riccardo Hernandez’s designs, much of Diane Paulus’ staging takes place in a perspex box above the audience’s heads. Appropriate images of sex and violence are seen on surrounding video screens. Other scenes are located on a central highway that separates one half of the audience from the other.Acting performances are decent rather than special, with a lot of cliched playing out of the stereotypes of film noir. It seems a long 90 minutes.

Julia Sporsen’s Donna Anna slightly out-sings her Don Ottavio, sung by Eyjolfur Eyjolfsson, and Laura Parfitt makes for a feisty Donna Elvira, the vengeful, spurned lover from Burgos.The updating to Franco’s postwar Seville is done relatively subtlety, mainly evidenced by a few handguns and by placing the Don in military uniform. Michael Rosewell directs a robust and tonally varied reading of the score, playing up the comic touches with flair and the dramatic moments with gothic immediacy. His orchestra is highly skilled and well prepared.ETO does its fair share of outreach and community work, but through its main output – this spring it tours three varied productions across 15 venues – it is truly at the front line of converting new audiences to opera, and this it does with the highest ideals and the least air of stuffiness.

He also affectingly portrays an obsession with Carmen that leads uncontrollably to his ruin. But, although Spanish mezzo-soprano Nancy Fabiola Herrera sings with gamey richness, she doesn’t quite convince us of Carmen’s infallible seductiveness, or of her hell-bent protection of her cherished freedom. Susan Gritton sings Micaela with a well-judged combination of tender innocence and later, touching bravery but, at 40-something, she inevitably fails to look the part of Don Jose’s 17-year-old would-be fiancee. American Kyle Ketelsen is vocally attractive in the role of the triumphant toreador Escamillo and he commands the stage well, but his approach is over-smooth, whereas a rather brasher Latino machismo is required.Zambello manages to weave the real animals – a pony and a horse – onto the stage without them stealing the scenes, and the multilayered activity in the Square unfolds naturally. What works less well are Tanya McCallin’s bland ochre wall designs, which return, reconfigured, in Act II and Act III.Israeli conductor Daniel Oren seems more preoccupied with speed than detail, though he recreates the score with some excitement. This is certainly an enjoyable Carmen overall, but not perhaps a thrilling one.

Even now, this characteristic Birtwistle amalgam of ritual, folk tale, straight down the line modernism and violence seems uncompromising, but therein lies its strength. With a score influenced by Stravinsky but already sounding, in its gritty directness and tormented lyricism, very much like the Birtwistle of later years, and a brilliant libretto by Stephen Pruslin that moves elements of the familiar Punch and Judy show around within a text that makes reference to dozens of other operas, we surely have one of the classics of its period.It certainly registers as such in this crisp and articulate staging by Michael McCarthy, which balances the grotesque comedy, intermittent pathos and sheer energy of this roller-coaster of a piece. Simon Banham’s designs are as colourful and immediate as a pantomime, while Michael Rafferty conducts a pin-point accurate reading of the score.Gwion Thomas digs deep into the semi-psychotic, semi-pathetic Punch, a symbolic figure caught up in a cycle of casual violence and frustrated love he can never comprehend. Carol Rowlands’ performances as Judy and the Fortune Teller are masterly. Allison Bell hits the high notes as Pretty Polly, while Jeremy Huw Williams leers menacingly as Choregos and Jack Ketch. Indeed, this production of one of the great British operas of our time is a triumph for all concerned.

Now it has one, courtesy of English Touring Opera and director James Conway, which gives a good idea of its strengths and weaknesses.Among its strengths is its plot, with the outsider Susannah being hounded by religious zealots and seduced by the hypocritical minister Olin Blitch – a marvellous role played to the hilt by Andrew Slater. Her brother – given a tower-of-strength interpretation by Todd Wilander – then shoots Blitch, leaving Susannah more of an outsider than ever.The score’s most positive feature is an immediate, folksy style that draws much of its material from its locale and is regularly effective. On the other hand, Floyd’s technical skills are limited. Rhythmically, much of what we hear is flat-footed. Parts of the piece are overly repetitious and even banal. A little more subtlety would go a long way.But this is a fine production, with Conway’s assured and focused direction propelling the drama over the footlights. Design and lighting are expertly done, and Alexander Ingram’s conducting is tight and pacy.Donna Bateman seizes all opportunities in the title role, and Sean Clayton makes much of her oddball friend, Little Bat. But the score palls long before the evening is over.

Within a week of the release of a film about the Boleyn sisters, ETO scores a canny coup with its own take on Anne’s life. This is, in effect, a prequel to the same team’s acclaimed 2005 production of Maria Stuarda.The modern performance history of Anna Bolena, Donizetti’s breakthrough opera, begins with a Callas production at La Scala. It is to ETO’s credit that the challenge of illustrious predecessors hasn’t deterred James Conway and Soutra Gilmour from reviving the work in fine, traditional style. If the two-tier set is contemporary functional, costumes are very much in period. In a departure from the company’s usual practice, the (radically pruned) score is presented in Italian with supertitles. Brazilian tenor Luciano Botelho brings ideal Latin colour and winning lyricism to the role of Lord Percy. While convincingly villainous, baritone Riccardo Simonetti’s Henry VIII produces more grit than velvet – he is from Lancashire. Serena Kay’s Smeaton is gamely acted if imperfectly co-ordinated with the pit. The role of Jane Seymour is a challenge for any star mezzo and young Julia Riley shows great potential in it. Nevertheless, the final scene before the scaffold is Donizetti’s dramatic and musical highlight and here Julie Unwin (ETO’s much-praised Tosca) at last comes into her own in the name part. Her earlier attempts at regal restraint seem a little stolid and she does not always characterise the text with sufficient force. Eschewing modish tricks, the production will doubtless acquire edge and focus as the run continues. The orchestral contribution is notably expert and elegant.

There are almost too many visual coups. First up is a dropcloth depicting a familiar image of a naked youth in melancholy pose, though any homoerotic intent is jettisoned during the opera itself, which emphasises rather the presence of water in all its forms. A stream is set (for some invisibly) into the floor of the stage. The heroine wades into it after she has dispatched her fateful letter. Later, it becomes an ice rink – St Petersburg’s frozen Neva. Peter Mumford’s lighting makes great play with watery effects.Meanwhile scenery and costumes border on the hallucinogenic, eschewing the down-to-earth realism once considered de rigueur. The action is set in a series of framed, noisily moveable boxes, although the singers tend to step forward to address the audience direct in their big numbers.The main roles are cast from strength. Gerald Finley doesn’t do caddish, his Onegin inescapably noble of bearing as well as focused of voice. When he tells Tatyana he can love her only as a brother, it seems to reveal his own lack of self-awareness, deliberate put-down no longer.Piotr Beczala’s Lensky is a more conventional portrayal. Making her house debut as Tatyana, Hibla Gerzmava brings more recognisably Slavic timbre. She is genuinely fresh and affecting as the timid young provincial with girlish dreams and a little adolescent puppy fat.Other stand-outs include Hans-Peter Konig’s resonant Prince Gremin and Elizabeth Sikora’s characterful Nurse. Jiri Belohlavek, another Royal Opera first-timer, conducts with unsensational skill.

Now a world famous superstar, he brings to his homeland his celebrated portrayal of Shakespeare’s most loveable rogue.From curtain up to curtain down, the sheer size and theatricality of Terfel’s interpretation of this cowardly glutton, this bald-headed blowhard, this irascible charmer ever in pursuit of wine, women and vast quantities of good food, is quite mesmerising. His exuberant Falstaff is so richly characterised and so magnificently sung that, unsurprisingly, he dominates throughout.Yet this is essentially an ensemble production with group chemistry self-evident. The women are positive personalities, ahead of the game at every twist and turn, gleefully engineering their vain lardbucket of a would-be seducer to his humiliating comeuppance. And what a strong, stylish band they are.Claire Ormshaw and Rhys Meirion, as the lovers Nannetta and Fenton, combine joyously, while Christopher Purves projects an excellent Ford.Julian Close and Neil Jenkins are suitably dissolute as Pistol and Bardolph, with Anthony Mee impressing as the outraged Caius. The chorus is in rousing and lively form, with Isaac Marks an eye-catching, diminutive Page to the old reprobate.Carlo Rizzi conducts a thrilling account with all the zest for life this comic opera demands, bringing out the sheer vivacity of that life-enhancing fugue finale with its compassionate verdict that all the world’s a joke and he who laughs last laughs best. That surely could be Terfel, still chuckling in his well-rounded belly as he soars heavenward.

Her voice has clarity and soaring emotion. She radiates hope and longing and defiance.Dee is paired with Ruslan Zinevych as her American lover Pinkerton and they look good together. Their duets are balanced beautifully. They ebb and flow.This Pinkerton is more naïve than self-serving and he suffers terrible regret for the tragedy he has caused. In the role of Sharpless, the American Consul, that finely toned baritone Vladimir Dragos will win many more admirers. Zarui Vardanean as Cio Cio San’s maid Suzuki is not given much to do, which is rather a pity. She can act and she sings with perkiness.The chorus gels impressively when singing, but its boys and girls need to be moving as a crowd and with purpose, not as loosely connected individuals – especially when they are gathered for Cio Cio San’s wedding.The Odessa Opera company’s orchestra is impressively balanced and has a sweet string section. Its gentle, delicate playing during Cio Cio San’s night-long vigil, as she waits for Pinkerton, is inspired; a mix of hope, torment and foreboding.This is excellent opera. Sung in the original Italian, traditionally staged and dressed with lovely Oriental colours.

Bringing in well-known writers such as Alexander McCall Smith and Ian Rankin also helps Scottish Opera raise its profile beyond the regular opera press.All the shows have something to offer. The King’s Conjecture is a medieval tale that profiles the remarkable Kate Valentine as a deaf and dumb woman caring for a special child. Uniting Glasgow’s Celtic past and Asian present, The Queens of Govan includes an exceptional performance from Elizabeth McCormack and sensational sarod playing from Wajahat Khan. The whimsical Dream Angus features a chorus of singing pigs in a story about a wife seeking therapy to reconcile herself to her husband’s infidelities.Highly effective is Armstrong and Rankin’s exploration of the true story of the composer Gesualdo, who murdered his wife and her lover. But the evening’s hit is The Perfect Woman, a funny and disturbing piece by librettist Ron Butlin and Lyell Cresswell, written with skill and imagination.

The girl eventually persuades the villagers to trust the giant, who ends up showing them how to clear their lake of algae, thereby restoring the stocks of fish on which their livelihoods depend. As well as encouraging us to treat outsiders with understanding rather than suspicion, the tale also conveys that, with a little insight, we can enable nature to heal itself.McNeff’s music is mostly modern in idiom, with the band of five instrumentalists placed on stage and dressed as villagers. The relationship between music and action/emotion is less closely tethered than might be ideal for a children’s opera (or perhaps any opera), which means that the simplicity of the concluding work-song – sung as the villagers pull together to clear the lake of algae – seems a wrench. Of the cast of five, Claire McCaldin stands out in the dramatic colour offered by her scene as the dodgy, stardust-peddling salesman.The stage and lighting designs by Alex Lowde and David Holmes present a more austere atmosphere than Michael Foreman’s book illustrations; and the book’s human giant is morphed effectively into a stranger presence: a large puppet worn above the shoulders of its operator. But this only deepens the atmosphere of struggling, insular village life.

A huge replica of the Saint Michael statue from the Castel Sant’Angelo presides over the third act, from the base of which Tosca plunges to her death in spectacular fashion.The grand gestures are well covered in Freeman’s production – even if bent chief of police Scarpia’s apartment in Act II sports a rather over-sized dining table – and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under Peter Robinson does justice to both the lyricism and pungency of Puccini’s score.What, inevitably, falls short in this in-the-round staging is a sense of intimacy. It’s little enough help that there’s precious little chemistry between Joseph Wolverton’s Cavaradossi and Cynthia Lawrence’s Tosca in the first act, but it’s a shame that they’re rattling around in a huge open space. And in the first-act climax, as the stage is flooded with choirboys and parishioners in the climactic Te Deum, the triumphant machinations of Scarpia – who has set the path for Tosca’s destruction – are completely swamped by the liturgical spectacle.The singing is good all round, though. Wolverton’s Cavaradossi is fearless in spirit, if slightly less so in tone, and Lawrence’s Tosca is solid, if unfeisty (she is a diva, after all). Peter Sidhom’s Scarpia is well observed, and Aled Hall’s physical stature lends a suitable air of toughness to the henchman Spoletta.The amplified singing does mean you lose some tonal variety, and though presented in English, the text is not always crisply communicated. But with a good standard of singing and playing, and a generally effective production, this is a Tosca certainly worth catching.

Es Devlin’s costumes suggest the thirties, her set some well-used anteroom to the kitchens of a palatial Middle Eastern residence.Devlin also provides the evening’s coup de theatre, when Salome’s dance for Herod leads them both through seven rooms that move from the wings to centre stage. The dance itself, though, in Andrew George’s choreography, is more a review of Salome’s psychological past, with video images suggesting an abusive relationship with her stepfather, than a display of teenage sexuality used to manipulative and perverse ends.Unusually for McVicar, the show as a whole lacks clarity of focus, though there is some effective detail and some truly disturbing moments. Not quite enough, perhaps, to make the opera the steadily rising curve of opulent degeneracy its creator had it mind, something not helped by conducting from Philippe Jordan that is distanced and less punchy than it might be.Ex-mezzo Nadja Michael needs more charisma and soprano gloss to make Salome shine and Michaela Schuster’s rich-voiced Herodias is a little too amiable. Robin Leggate, standing in as Herod for an indisposed Thomas Moser on the first night, goes through the vocal and dramatic motions with alacrity. Michael Volle’s grand presence and grander tone, however, make his John the Baptist a force to be reckoned with.

Arguably the sexual abuse she suffers at the hands of her brother Enrico – powerfully sung and acted by Mark Stone – is a step too far, and unsupported by the text.Partnering her as her illicit lover Edgardo is Barry Banks, a bitter, furious presence with empowered vocalism to match.On the first night Clive Bayley’s Raimondo had succumbed to bronchitis; his creepy chaplain leered from the stage while Paul Whelan sang the role, magnificently. Another of Alden’s goings-too-far involves turning the luckless Arturo – another of the opera’s victim figures – into an effete and preening interloper. Dwayne Jones realises this effectively nevertheless.Dramatically, the opera’s steadily rising trajectory falters at the halfway point of the mad scene and the final scene is undisciplined. Still, Charles Edwards’ stressed Victorian interiors describe the financial and spiritual decay that lie at the heart of the tragedy, and there’s enough insight as well as impetus in Alden’s direction to ensure that the drama hits home with considerable force, the odd excess notwithstanding.

Performances are again first-class. As Tatyana, Nuccia Focile is truly moving in the famed letter scene as she pours out her innocent, girlish passion, all the more poignant when she is so patronisingly rejected.Paul Charles Clarke as the earnest, over-sensitive poet, the doomed Lensky is lyrically expressive in both love and anger. In the title role of the aloof cynic Onegin, Rodion Pogossov takes time to establish impact, but grows in stature until his final humiliation is powerfully conveyed. Brindley Sherratt reprises his role as the older worldly-wise Gremin, his touching tribute to his young wife again proving a much appreciated highlight.Strong support comes from Kathleen Wilkinson as the old nurse Filipyevna and Alexandra Sherman as Olga, while Michael Clifton-Thompson’s cameo of the precious French poet Triquet quite delightfully resists caricature.Revival director Caroline Chaney re-captures the spirit of the original staging, though still hampered by the angular sets of Tobias Hoheisel. The picture-framing arches, hedges and pillars emphasise intimacy but limit the outdoor activity and ballroom dancing. Alexander Polianichoko conducts the on-form orchestra with true Russian feeling and fervour.A pity therefore that such an otherwise enjoyable performance is marred by its presentation. Surely sets should be designed to be changed quickly in such a state of the art theatre? Yet it was necessary to bring up the houselights between every one of the seven scenes, fracturing the delicate moods created. An opera which should take just over three hours inclusive of two intervals is actually spread over three and three-quarter hours.

David Curry makes a particularly fine Frederic opposite a sweet, but ultimately pedestrian Deborah Myers as Mabel. Barry Clark is a blustering Major General Stanley, full of vigour, with an amusing skit behind the gauze during the overture, and Sophie-Louise Dann makes great use of her comic and vocal talents in the role of Edith.Steven Page lacks energy as the Pirate King and is almost over-shadowed in this instance by Michael Kerry as a vigorous, rollicking Samuel. This balance of performances just manages to work until the second act and the appearance of Jo Brand as the Sergeant of Police. Brand’s inability to either sing, dance or act brings the proceedings to an unworthy low, creating to all intents and purposes, car crash operetta.There was one particularly stand-out performance here and that was Beverley Klein as Ruth. Klein gleefully exploits the obvious comic potential, but grounds her performance in the very real sense of desolation upon discovery that she has wasted her life in devotion to her charge.

The rituals are impressive without being over-solemn, the pantomimic forays a joy, the visual imagery striking, with some jokey set pieces earning deserved applause.The box setting of Julian Crouch with its multitude of doors against a skyscape, are worthy of a French farce, unifying and practical, while Magritte-inspired costumes by Kevin Pollard are as unexpected as they are delightfully eccentric.The musical kaleidoscope ranging from the enchanting lyricism of the lovers, through the dramatic trials of the Brotherhood, to the pop tunes of the birdcatcher, is sensitively conducted by Gareth Jones.As Pamina, Rebecca Evans is expressively elegant and so touching, matched by Russell Thomas as a convincingly resolute Tamino. The Papageno of Neal Davies is an off-beat exotic creation justly rewarded by his winning the dollybird Papagena of Claire Hampton. Satisfying portrayals too from Laure Meloy the evil Queen, David Soar with his authoritative Sarastro and David Stout as the Speaker, plus love-hungry trio of Edwardian maids in the nocturnal Royal household, Camilla Roberts, Anne-Marie Gibbons and Joanne Thomas.Though sung and acted in an English version by Jeremy Sams, there are subtitles in English as well (and in Welsh for performances in Wales) which makes the dazzling presentation more than usually accessible.

Not so this. The sets and costumes are exquisite, providing a perfect accompaniment to this story of forlorn love, and choosing such a young, vibrant cast is a masterstroke.Maria Tsonina, as the doomed Violetta, grows magnificently into role with a commanding presence that blossoms as the opera gathers pace. The Empire is a huge theatre, and at first she struggles to be heard above the orchestra. However as the story unfolds, Tsonina surmounts this difficulty and turns in a fabulous performance that has all but the stoniest reaching for their tissues.No such problems befall Ruslan Zinevych. Here is a tenor with a great future – he imperiously grabs the role of Alfredo by the scruff of the neck and shakes it for all of its worth, until all of the emotion of the part is exposed for all to see.Also worthy of mention are Vladimir Dragos, in the role of Alfredo’s ill-advised father – who holds an exemplary command of his part in the proceedings – and Tattiana Virlan playing Violetta’s maid, Anninia.This is a truly majestic evening, brought up to the mark by sterling performances all around, fabulous sets, costumes and music conducted faultlessly by Gheorghe Stanciu.

Ian MacKenzie-Thurley, who also adapted the text, gets astonishing performances from his cast.The Gravedigger, superbly acted by Peter Sowerbutts, narrates the cut events for us such as Polonius’ death and Rosencrantz and Guildernstern’s trip to England. He also acts as our guide through the theatre, for this is a promenade piece.Baritone James McOran Campbell sings stunningly in the title role, sweetly conveying Hamlet’s melancholy and prevarication. Mezzo-soprano Carol Rowlands and baritone Charles Johnston as Gertrude and Claudius are excellent, as much for their dramatic input as their ability to hit the right notes. The setting for Ophelia’s demise is deceptively simple – a keynote of this production is that the whole is so much more than its parts. Olivia Safe’s exhilarating soprano, in the bare white walls and stunning acoustics of the scenery workshop, is intensely moving.Musical director Magnus Gilljam deftly accompanies the singers on keyboards and a flute. If the students’ contribution is anything to go by, there are exciting times ahead for theatre design.

The original concept wears well save for some over-insistent lighting, no matter that the off-white art deco hotel setting (1920s Brighton rather than Imperial Japan) is no longer groundbreaking or controversial. It’s the would-be ironic cut-glass accenting of selected vowels that begins to grate. Given his vast experience as Ko-Ko, Richard Suart’s portrayal, a grimacing operatic amalgam of Leonard Rossiter and Max Wall, has particular confidence and pace. As always he presents a topically updated little list, hitting out at the house’s own un-mourned production of Kismet as well as the more predictable political targets. Wyn Davies in the pit gives him plenty of space. Elsewhere the verve and sparkle of the show seems compromised by some lack of thrust and a rather small-sounding string section. The new Nanki-Poo is Robert Murray, a suitably English lyric tenor with a vibrant top. Of the serial returnees, Sarah Tynan’s Yum-Yum avoids too much winsomeness; her showpiece aria, The Sun Whose Rays, is taken seriously at a deliberate tempo. Frances McCafferty’s Katisha triumphs through expert acting and comic nous rather than vocal heft. Richard Angas is again the outsize, worldly-wise Mikado, avuncular rather than menacing. Of the smaller parts, Pitti-Sing is winningly taken by the young Swedish mezzo-soprano Anna Grevelius, definitely one to watch.

Evocative lines of Shakespeare run around the auditorium’s balcony in electric-blue neon striplights – and there’s no set to speak of, except for a four-tier, neon-framed double bunk, within and around which the singers deftly climb. Distracting video projections – of water droplets, an owl flying, of Titania sleeping combine with Act III’s sunrise (represented by a panel of orange lightbulbs) to turn this dream into a something closer to a nightmare.Thankfully Jami Reid-Quarrell’s acrobatic, rope-climbing Puck returns, as does William Towers’ Oberon – now more vocally robust – and Gillian Keith’s Titania like a white Goth exhibiting bizarre Kate Bush-like arm movements. The two central pairs of lovers are well cast, with Ed Lyon’s thrilling Lysander contrasting with Jacques Imbrailo’s slightly creamier Demetrius. Returning in the role of Helena, Katie Van Kooten has noticeably bloomed vocally.If the mechanicals seem less entertaining than first time around, they are newly led by Matthew Rose, seemingly a Bottom to unseat all Bottoms. His rich bass is allied to a disarmingly natural stage presence. Rory Macdonald in the pit fails to coax maximum enchantment from Britten’s score, but despite this, and the quite charmless production, this production is well worth catching for the athletic Puck and the fine singing all round.

The show makes an intriguing contrast with the unobtrusive production by Moshe Leiser and Patrice Caurier revived last year at Covent Garden.The ENO team goes for a riot of colour – a set of gorgeously shimmering blocks and screens, a mirrored-effect ceiling to reflect the space and the participation of a band of puppeteers veiled in black. While details of Butterfly’s household, and even her child, are brought to life with technical wizardry, the resort to puppetry can introduce an element of artificiality, just when you need the emotion to feel real. Rather more effective is the stylised curtain call for Butterfly herself, silhouetted against a blood red background.The key players spend much of the drama occupying their own space. It’s difficult to decide whether this is a conscious attempt at oriental formality or a byproduct of the preoccupation with image, lighting and choreography.That adaptable soprano Judith Howarth takes a while to find her best form. Ultimately she evokes the vulnerability and sweetness of the character, even when emotional intimacy is undercut by too much stage business. Her supporting team remains wooden, not least Gwyn Hughes Jones’s oft-seen Pinkerton, looking and sounding like a Welsh rugby prop forward.Neither the sonorously voiced Suzuki of Karen Cargill (her ENO debut), nor the Sharpless of Ashley Holland are encouraged to make much dramatic impact, and Christopher Gillett is physically implausible as Goro. The translation has its dodgy moments and the orchestral playing lacks dynamic range and idiomatic thrust. And yet, whatever the drawbacks, this is a winning spectacle, not the tearjerker it can be, but definitely an event.

She seems to have been shopping in Primark while the rest of the cast don period-influenced garb. Act I’s crescent moon and Act II’s rising sun provide especially striking images amid the prevailing gloom.Several of the protagonists have been here before. Not least Simon Keenlyside who presents his intensely physical, loveable and above all sensitively sung Papageno to an adoring audience. His baritone remains in peak condition quite apart from the other qualities he brings to the role. Erika Miklosa’s Queen of the Night is a less volatile theatrical presence, but she combines vibrant East European timbre with crystalline neatness and control. Less perfectly pitched is Christoph Strehl’s Tamino in a house debut that against expectations fails to inspire – the characterisation is patrician, the voice strained up top. First night nerves? Stephen Milling is physically imposing and predictably Wagnerian as Sarastro, John Graham-Hall enliveningly seedy as a pale-faced, diabolical Monostatos. Genia Kuhmeier’s girlish Pamina, is pure and strong if not exactly sublime.There is plenty of life left in a lavish production which will no doubt run and run even without its star performance.

Fisherman Grimes, an awkward, lumbering loner is suspected of ill treating his young apprentice. Then the boy’s body is found. It is the stuff of headlines.The Opera North chorus, clothed in dark blues and sandy yellows, creates a living, feeling, angry community. The way the townsfolk seize on rumour is chilling. There is little in the way of scenery but more is not needed. Pallets create a pub floor, decking and fencing. At other times a huge fishing net is hoisted. Lighting and colours and an ever moving, ever shifting chorus do the rest.In the title role Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts gives a towering performance. Powerful, quick of temper and yet capable of surprising physical tenderness, he is bewildered by life – and tragedy beckons.Grimes has his sympathisers. Giselle Allen as good-natured widow Ellen Orford is beautifully poignant rather than merely sad. Christopher Purves makes a deep impression as the sensible Captain Balstrode.The sea is a significant character in the story and it is the sea in unremitting mood. Opera North’s orchestra, conducted by Richard Farnes, gives Benjamin Britten’s orchestral interludes stirring treatment, most especially with Storm.

She’s also not yet giving us a view of her character from inside and rarely touches the heart.Which her colleague, German tenor Jonas Kaufmann, regularly does with his gauche, impetuous young lover Alfredo. Kaufmann shows the odd sign of a cold – he coughs more than consumptive Violetta – but despite that his singing is invariably poised and elegant. This is another outstanding performance from the finest German lyric tenor in decades.Best of all is the deeply considered and magnificently sung Germont of Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky, now in his absolute vocal prime and giving a dramatic reading which exposes the uncomfortable fact that Germont’s appeal to Violetta is harsh but not unrealistic.The smaller roles are decently done, with Sarah Pring making more of Violetta’s maid Annina than usual, without pushing herself unduly into the limelight. Patrick Young has done a good job in giving Richard Eyre’s 1994 staging solid credibility, but the sets, as before, are less than distinguished. Solid conducting too from Maurizio Benini, which is on the right side of routine.

Meanwhile glamorous soprano Lynn Marie Boudreau discovers the delights of dalliance and back stream punting with the tenor lothario Bloomfield.Think of it as a companion piece to the Menier hit revival of Sunday in the Park With George, but with better tunes, culminating in a modern re-creation of Edouard Manet’s erotic Dejeneur sur l’herbe, as this quartet of mixed-up lovers loll on the picnic lawn – although the clever rhyming lyrics they deliver are more Gilbertian than Sondheim.A special word, too, for accompanist Kelvin Lim whose fleet keyboard fingering rivals Franz Liszt in bringing orchestral coloration and depth to piano transcriptions of Mozart’s greatest hits.

Opera, by tradition, should be reverential and moralistic. What Donizetti created, however, with respect, resembles more of a nineteenth century Carry On film, thanks to its irreverent form and humour. Though filled with wonderful music and fabulous arias, it is little wonder then that he wrote it in honour of Liverpool and its warm, if non-conformist, people.Without doubt, the star of this story of revenge, love, desire, hatred and passion, is Francesca Park in the title role, whose coquettish charm filled this glorious if underused auditorium with warmth for the whole time she was on stage. Gracious in her faultless delivery, it would have been worth queuing to see Park perform as Emilia alone, without the added bonuses of Vasco Francanzani playing the roguish Don Ramualdo, Philippe Talbot as the much maligned Frederico, Marc Canturri as the deeply intense Claudio and Joelle Fleury as the beautiful Luigia.With conductor Giovanni Pacor controlling a perfect orchestra in front of him and a sublime choir packed into the circular balconies above, the room in which Dickens once read was rewarded for its patience in fine style, as the lighting, the music and the performances of all involved washed over the audience like a kiss from Donizetti himself, so creating a show of which all involved can be justly proud.

This is another classy revival and will give huge pleasure over the Christmas and New Year period.Not every vocal gesture is perfectly in place, however. Making her Covent Garden debut as Cenerentola, Czech mezzo Magdalena Kozena struggles a bit in her final triumphant aria and is a little too serious elsewhere. Toby Spence cannot hit every top C fair and square but he’s so fluent and likeable as Prince Ramiro that it doesn’t matter. The Dandini, French baritone Stephane Degout, had a slightly vocal disposition on the first night, but once again his stage charm gets him through.In Alessandro Corbelli’s Don Magnifico, however, voice and physical artistry are in perfect alignment. This is one of the best buffo performances you’ll ever see or hear. Lorenzo Regazzo makes a series of dignified and heart-warming interventions as Alidoro, Rossini’s male equivalent of the fairy godmother, and both the naughty stepsisters – Elena Xanthoudakis and Leah-Marian Jones – give full value and are huge fun.Evelino Pido’s conducting could do with a touch more precision – not all of the marvellous ensembles are as crisp as they should be – but despite minor flaws this strong cast, sensational production and Rossini’s treasurable score provide a great evening’s entertainment.

Petra Lang’s Kundry is rather too contained in Act I but fires on all cylinders in the great seduction scene of the second act, where Willard White, also in authoritative voice, mesmerises as the magician Klingsor.Even more outstanding is Falk Struckmann’s dark and tormented Amfortas, with the tone pouring out in his scenes of physical and spiritual anguish. In the wrong hands Gurnemanz can be the greatest bore in opera, but with John Tomlinson singing the role, you hang on his every word, despite the now obvious wear in the top part of his voice. With smaller roles and chorus present and correct, much of Wagner’s strange and complex vision comes over. But don’t expect great visuals.

Performances are dramatically convincing and cleanly articulated, yet there are bound to be problems for more distant punters. Unavoidably perhaps, the disturbing intimacy of Britten’s original conception has been ditched in favour of something grander. The stage is black and bare, with lighting and costumes defiantly monochrome. Only (rather noisy) stylized sliding panels and occasional falling leaves impart an autumnal specificity. The foreground is occupied by bed, writing table or piano, plus, ever-present, a Wozzeck-ish hobby horse. This is not one of those readings in which it is possible to believe that the ghosts are incorporeal projections of the Governess’ own fear and phobias. Here they handle props and make floors creak, while Quint has a funny walk, more damaged than commanding. McVicar presumably wants to make tangible the forces of good and evil that battle for the children’s souls.Like the evening as a whole, Rebecca Evans’ Governess takes a while to warm up. Vocally lightweight, she is heartbreaking by the close to cap a highly physical performance of carefully ratcheted intensity. Ann Murray’s Mrs Grose is a big dramatic presence, even if the voice has lost some of its former quality and focus. Garry Walker conducts a select group of 13 players with diligence.Difficulties remain, however. Lighting designer Adam Silverman’s audacious effects make it impossible to make out much in the way of facial expressions and the contrasting blasts of white light are scarcely designed to comfort the eye. The spectacle is arresting but remote – one is not spooked.

But his music was thrown out of the repertoire in Germany and Austria by the Nazis, and for decades only his reputation as a Hollywood film composer kept his name alive. Now there’s a full-scale Korngold revival, and his vast 1927 mystical opera The Miracle of Heliane received this British premiere performance by the LPO under the persuasive baton of Vladimir Jurowski.On the negative side, a concert performance can’t give much idea of its dramatic qualities; it’s clearly fairly static anyway. The subject is extremely high-flown, with the arrival of a mysterious Stranger finally redeeming an unhappy kingdom following a dual resurrection from the dead for him and Heliane, wife of the oppressive Ruler.But much of the score – particularly the climactic third-act – is sumptuous to a degree, with Korngold showing a mastery of late-Romantic harmony and orchestration equal to any of his contemporaries. The performance was superbly played and conducted. The cast, positioned a long way back, made less of an impression, though Patricia Racette engaged with the title role, Michael Hendrick threw himself at the demanding tenor role of the Stranger, and Willard White poured out his authoritative tone as the Porter. Andreas Schmidt sounded less focused as the Ruler. It may be an uneven work, but the best of it merits revival.

Its six components, expertly projected by singers, ensemble and musical director Tim Murray are economically but memorably presented on a sparsely furnished open stage suffused with red light.The most finished pieces musically come at either end of the evening. Julian Grant and Meredith Oakes’ Anger, originally conceived as a private joke for ENO management, offers a sustained parody of opera composers and self-important opera critics. With Nyanyushka, Gary Carpenter and Simon Nicholson take a sideways look at Stalinism and Lactophilia via music indebted to Stravinsky’s A Soldier’s Tale. Diverse if generally shorter-breathed postmodern invention predominates elsewhere with extensive use of rhyming couplets for comic effect.The most user-friendly turn is the vaudevillian The Feathered Friend, Helen Chadwick and Alastair Middleton’s man-woman-parrot love triangle in which soprano Stephanie Corley doubles as puppeteer.The most inscrutable is On Such a Day, in which big name writer Philip Ridley pairs with Anna Meredith for a scene without protagonists or action. Three onstage computer-screens project faces whose changing expressions reflect the shifting emotions of offstage voices.Canadian composer Chris Mayo and Christopher Crebolder try hardest with Houses, the chronicle of three Toronto homes, interweaving taped narration, live performance, packing case props, past, present and future. The result is surprisingly evocative.Artistically uneven as it must be, the evening is a feather in the cap of artistic director Bill Bankes-Jones. It may or may not be opera, but even the programme booklet displays a certain flair.

Much darker is The Departure, from 1962, in which the victim of a car crash returns for one final encounter with her husband.Neither work is a lost masterpiece, but The Sofa is amiable enough in its waltzy way and there’s a dull ache to the more strained writing of The Departure. But what makes the evening worthwhile is the exceptional level of performance. Alessandro Talevi’s productions are sharply defined, brilliantly so in the case of the comedy, which Madeleine Boyd’s set and Ryszard Andrzejewski’s costumes transfer to an up-to-the-minute London club. Conductor Dominic Wheeler gives each score detailed attention and dynamism.The only weakness is poor diction, which is impossible to defend in such a small venue. But there are vivid standouts from Sarah Tynan’s Amy Winehouse lookalike Monique, Nicholas Sharratt’s energetic Dominique and Josephine Thorpe’s eccentric Grandmother, while the whole company carries the comedy off with tremendous verve. Sharratt’s transformation into a sofa is marvellously done. Though the material is slender, both these productions deserve a longer life-span.

It looks amiable enough, though the giant pyramid of bales of corn in the opening scene is cumbersome and necessitates an unwelcome pause halfway through the first act.The show, indeed, takes a while to get going, partly due to the young Finnish conductor Mikko Franck’s music-making, which is correct though lacking in brilliance, and partly because Polish soprano Aleksandra Kurzak’s vocally skilful Adina is pretty cold. Admittedly the character takes her time in warming to the idea of a dumb but good-hearted peasant lover, but Kurzak’s performance unfortunately registers as abrasive.Also not quite within his groove is Paolo Gavanelli’s Dr Dulcamara. This is essentially a broad comic role in the Italian buffo tradition, and neither Gavanelli’s superior voice nor his unsmiling manner sit comfortably with it. The fact that the biggest laughs in the show are won by a dog running across the stage is a sign something is not right.But Ludovic Tezier’s bold and brassy Sergeant Belcore is sung as handsomely as it is acted, and Stefano Secco, making his Covent Garden debut as Nemorino, possesses plenty of charm and a well-schooled voice.It’s still a rather cool evening, but may warm up during the run.

Much of this looks sumptuous and is apt to the ancient Egyptian setting. In addition, Rhodes and director Jo Davies have managed to find intimate spaces amid the grandeur for the heart of the piece.Where the production is least successful is in the famous triumph scene, whose dramatic kernel has gone missing in an all-out search for showbiz. The stifling authoritarianism of Egyptian society and the overweening power of the priests get lost amid the decorative dancing and visual frills.Much of the rest is sensibly traditional without riveting the attention. None of the central performances rises above dramatic routine. Best is Brindley Sherratt’s Ramfis, authoritatively sung and making sure we know who really runs Egypt. Gwynne Howell’s Pharaoh is vocally soft-grained and dramatically an old softie. John Hudson has a great night vocally as Radames, but as an actor he’s no more than decent. Much the same can be said of Claire Rutter in the title role. Jane Dutton’s Amneris is dramatically cardboard and vocally more limited than her tenor and soprano colleagues.But ENO’s music director, Edward Gardner, the orchestra and chorus offer thrilling music-making. All in all this is a creditable show, though scarcely the searching experience Verdi’s masterpiece deserves.

Scored for a chamber ensemble, it shows influences from the Second Viennese School, but also has strong tonal leanings. It is varied, immediate, punchy, and waywardly lyrical, matching the text with imagination. We should hear more of its composer.Michael Rafferty conducts the excellent 18-piece ensemble with alacrity, but Michael McCarthy’s staging is not so effective. On the first night, an indisposed Arlene Rolph may have been hampered by illness from suggesting the edgy, complex character of Miss Julie, and failed to rise in class above Andrew Rupp’s fatally amiable Jean. Not only is the class element in the scenario crucial, but equally a strong attraction between the two principals that scarcely registers here. Jean’s raw sexual charisma is missing. Nor does his fellow servant and fiancee Christine emerge with sufficient definition in the hands of Emma Gane.Simon Banham’s lean set is functional but weak on period. The device of having the orchestra placed highly visibly at the back of the stage is not to the work’s advantage. But, in spite of weaknesses in the execution, the piece itself is well worth encountering as it tours England and Wales over the next month.

The trickiness comes not in the modern English rendition of the lyrics – which are often mere pointers to the true drama, which lies in the music. It is in the accents given to those lyrics by the Dutch soloists and the completely incomprehensible chorus who sing from the pit.Some level of other-ness is necessary in the themes of retribution and forgiveness, as Spanish Nobleman Belmonte attempts to free his Konstanze from the harem of Turkish prince Bassa Selim. Yet, if there is too much, as there is here, it gets in the way of the performance. As does the slightly overpowering orchestra.Other elements are much more satisfactory, however. Director Tobias Hoheisel’s minimal set allows the focus to fall on the character and emotional development. While the cut from three to two acts, breaking after Julia Borchert’s beautifully fluid rendition of Konstanze’s defiant declaration that she prefers death to succumbing to Thomas Gerber’s sympathetically created Bassa, works with the drama of the piece.Dimitry Ivashchenko clearly relishes the weight of wickedness as harem overseer, Osmin. Rebecca Bottone brings out the clarity and gaiety of Blonde, Konstanze’s maid, that gives light to the shade of her mistresses predicament. Just perhaps, you imagine, she finds pleasure in her tussles with Osmin and, if Eberhard Lorenz’s sincere Pedrillo were not around, she would enjoy taming him.

The grandiose marquee, where high tea is celebrated in Act II following Albert’s coronation as May King, drew spontaneous applause from an appreciative audience.There’s a careful balance throughout between caricature – of the local vicar, school ma’am, mayor and superintendent – and social irony, yet Albert’s alcohol-induced scene of self-realisation in Act II can be psychologically tauter.The village children and the lovers Sid and Nancy (the supposedly worldly couple, whose naive lacing of Albert lemonade triggers his rebellion) are the perfect, carefree foil to the overbearing moral fortitude of the local dignitaries.Robert Murray is particularly strong in Herring’s downtrodden pre-transformation. Miranda Keys successfully ages up the role of Lady Billows, and of the dignitaries, Adrian Thompson’s bright tenor characterises the mayor, while Lynton Black eases satisfyingly into his pipe-smoking, harrumphing superintendent.Rory MacDonald can perhaps draw more defined colour from his fine ensemble, though the nocturnal bass flute and bass clarinet duet of the second Interlude is magically spun.As the debate continues as to what it is to be British, we here are faced with what we hope it is not.

Nor do the extensive video projections by Flora and Faunavisions – mainly concerned with maritime and undersea imagery – help focus attention on a drama of sex and power politics set in ancient Rome.From the start, Elizabeth Caitlin Ward’s flimsy modern costumes give the show more of a supermodel than a superpower look, and Shi-Zheng’s direction offers little more than one-dimensional stereotypes. It’s yet another ENO show with the wrong team in charge of the visuals.Much of what we hear is good, with conductor Laurence Cummings producing finely-honed baroque music-making in the pit. Kate Royal shines vocally as Poppea, though spends too much of the evening awkwardly placed on a high platform in Walt Spangler’s unimaginative set. She’s well partnered by Anna Grevelius’s energetic Nero. Tim Mead’s Ottone and Doreen Curran’s Ottavia are both vocally strong though largely unexplored dramatically.Robert Lloyd is a distinguished Seneca, Lucy Crowe makes her mark as Drusilla, and both Diana Montague and Christopher Gillett fulfil all requirements in the comic roles of the Nurse and Arnalta respectively.

It has an exuberant lyricism and many dazzling arias. An interesting story is tinged with irony and moments of fun. Some secondary identities and relationships will have people studying the programme synopsis, but that’s what a synopsis is for.King Croesus, Paul Nilon in good form, is rather full of himself. He gets his comeuppance from Cyrus, King of Persia, played by a commanding Henry Waddington.Croesus’ son Atis, played by the soaring American soprano Michael Maniaci, is mute. The capture and threatened execution of his father so shocks Atis that his voice returns and Maniaci can begin to earn his pay cheque.Providing the romantic interest for Atis is the sweetly-toned Gillian Keith as Elmira.The raked stage is a huge war room in the 1930s. Model fighter planes are flown by steel helmeted soldiers and there is a back cloth of blazing oil fields. For the second act, there is part of a wrecked plane on stage.Baroque specialist Harry Bicket conducts with relish. The Opera North musicians do exactly what he asks of them and share his enthusiasm.

Its scenario hardly bristles with humour – the tavern landlady Rita slaps around her timid husband Beppe – she herself was abused by her former husband, Gaspar, who has come back to town to pick up his marriage certificate so he can remarry. Beppe sees Gaspar’s arrival as a means of escape from his own marital bruisings, and the two men attempt to wriggle out of getting stuck with Rita. Ultimately, Gaspar instructs Beppe how to stand up for himself – resolving the tension of the latter’s marriage.The fifties Italian cafe-bar set by Kevin Knight’s is stylish, and director Thomas Guthrie makes a subtle feature of passing customers – with one wife berating her errant husband in the background, while Rita lays into her own long-suffering spouse. As with the director, the cast is drawn from the Jette Parker Young Artists Programme. Tenor Haoyin Xue (Beppe) produces a rounded but sometimes subdued sound, though unfailingly produces the goods in his stratospheric C sharps. Australian soprano Anita Watson creates a large stage persona, and relishes her Italian consonants. Perhaps the most impressive performance comes from Polish baritone Krzysztof Szumanski. His smoothly modulated tone and well-observed yet effortless physical and facial gestures point to an exciting future. Andrew Griffiths conducts the youthful players of the Southbank Sinfonia with a fair degree of panache.

English Touring Opera has bravely adopted this Italian tragic drama for its autumn tour and, overall, it’s a striking success. The surtitles are based on the libretto’s presentation in the word book for the first performances, which highlights the overriding mood of arias, rather than offering literal translations – a novel effect that is less confusing than a confounding diagram in the programme book would lead you to believe.Adam Wiltshire’s stodgy castle wall sets tend to cramp the stage, but the playing and singing, directed by Michael Rosewell, is of a very high standard. Swedish mezzo Lina Markeby’s Arcanes is focused and dramatically effective, and the central trio is first rate – Gail Pearson is vocally agile as the king’s ward Agilea, Jeni Bern colourfully inhabits the role of the jilted enchantress Medea. Even in this distinguished company, American mezzo Valerie Komar stands out as Teseo, with a suitably heroic physical presence and vocal apparatus to match. Even her most virtuosic arias are projected with seemingly ear-deceiving facility. Her Act 5 duet with Pearson’s Agilea is one of several memorable highlights.At the opera’s end the flames of the burning palace (torched by the thwarted Medea), are quelled by two small children – in place of the goddess Minerva’s Priest. These are the children of Medea, it appears, intervening on their mother’s behalf. They sing like angels, but the effect is hardly convincing. Perhaps, though, this is Medea’s final comeuppance – that the kids have to clear up mummy’s little mess. How embarrassing for the evil enchantress must that be?

There’s less precision, perhaps, than when the show was first seen, but it still packs a memorable punch, while Ultz’s designs have their own manic authority, even though the sets have been slimmed down for touring purposes.The weak link in the cast is Russian soprano Svetlana Sozdateleva as Lady Macbeth. She lacks stage presence and makes little impact dramatically. In addition, she quite often sings out of tune. Verdi did not demand a beautiful voice for the role – in fact he said it would be inappropriate. But this particular soprano does not fit the bill under any heading.By her side, Stephen Gadd’s Macbeth is a tower of strength. Not only is he in perfect vocal command of the role, but there is plenty of nuance both in his singing and his acting. His realisation is an exceptional achievement.Notable also are Ilya Bannik’s strongly sung Banquo and Stefano Ferrari’s equally vibrant Macduff. But the chief factor in the evening’s success is the young conductor Robin Ticciati, now Glyndebourne on Tour’s music director. He shows a keen understanding of Verdi’s style and knows how to propel the rhythms without ever hurrying them. His performance, ably seconded by the chorus and orchestra, not only reveals what an exceptional score this is but also fully justifies his appointment.

Sergeant Belcore’s trumped-up claims of his allure to women are robbed of their bumptiousness; and the potion-touting quack Dulcamara whips up little excitement among the village folk with his slick promises – no doubt partly obfuscated by the accompanying projected animations. And the encounter between the lovestruck Nemorino and the beautiful Adina, staged during the Prelude, needlessly gives away the game.But Dulcamara’s musical contribution to Adina’s pre-wedding party, with the help of his cross-dressed assistant, raises laughs, and Les Brotherston’s crumbling façade set is both evocative and practical.Though he lacks an Italianate ringing tone, Peter Auty sings Nemorino with flair and sophistication, even if his portrayal is perhaps too knowing. His Adina, Adriana Kucerová, is as transparent and capricious vocally as she is flirtatiously confident. While Eliana Pretorian makes an impact in the tiny role of Giannetta, Luciano Di Pasquale’s Dulcamara is often vocally laboured – his celebrated patter aria is released with all the fizz of his tired remedies.Spanish-born Enrique Mazzola, in his Glyndebourne debut, saves the evening, keeping a tight grip on his forces and eliciting rhythmic precision while revealing telling expressive colours. One only hopes that the lack of joy in this production might be addressed with L’elisir’s reincarnation for the Glydnebourne Festival in two years’ time.

Once again, orchestral standards are high and Antonio Pappano’s conducting takes the wider view as well as focusing on detail.Lisa Gasteen is in less good voice than in Siegfried, with some raw notes but a general air of confidence if not of deep understanding. John Treleaven’s Siegfried is not ideal of tone or heft, but he’s a credible Heldentenor in a near-impossible role. Mihoko Fujimura’s Waltraute is visually striking but her diction is unclear in a crucial scene.New at this stage is Kurt Rydl’s Hagen, aptly baleful and drawn on a grand scale. The Gibichung pair – Peter Coleman-Wright as Gunther, Emily Magee as Gutrune – understand their place in the scheme and chart it skilfully. Peter Sidhom once again makes a highlight of his scene as Alberich, though his placement by Warner high up in a boat and on a life-support system is an unhelpful example of the production’s tendency to subtract from the whole by adding. Visually, the main objection to Warner’s Ring is that he impedes his own vision by small and puzzling interventions that compromise the bigger picture. The Ring already has quite enough enigmas of its own.Yet the cycle as a whole proves more worthwhile than the staging of the four individual operas suggested would be the case.

Even during the overture, Paul Carey Jones’ Fiorello is busy organising clowns, tradesmen and city guardsmen into a chorus of musicians for Adrian Dwyer’s aloof Almaviva. Quite where they all come from is unclear, but they certainly fit into Simon Higlett’s crowded design of early 20th century faded grandeur.As if to compensate for such a full stage, conductor Sergio La Stella sets off at an invigorating pace. It makes for a light and airy production that is only slightly undone by Dwyer’s annoyingly thin tone of voice. Thomas Oliemans as Figaro might not fit quite as snugly into Allen’s scheme as he might, but his voice is easily bold and swaggering enough to do so.It is Karen Cargill’s Rosina who is the real find here as the facade opens up to reveal Bartolo’s decrepit but cavernous home. Who wouldn’t fall for her erotically charged voice as she and Dwyer exchange arias in the singing lesson? Or shiver with a touch of disgust at Nicholas Folwell’s Dr Bartolo attempts to keep her for himself in a performance that, theatrically and musically, creates a complex character who is all-too aware of his own shortcomings?The early energy keeps on coming right to the end, with Carey Jones leading in the city guards, and plenty of energy from Karin Thyselius as Berta and Giles Tomkins as Don Basilio. An crowd-pleasing production that has enough complexities and theatrical depths to bear many, and no doubt welcome, returns.

Some of the credit for this must go to Antonio Pappano, whose conducting has gained in continuity, allowing the whole experience more momentum. But other elements have improved, too.One of them is John Treleaven’s Siegfried. His tone is steadier than when the opera named after him opened in 2005, and his dramatic reading – hearty, gauche, charmless, yet not insensitive – has gained ground too.Peter Sidhom’s Alberich remains utterly focused, and in its vocal and physical intensity would be difficult to match today. Lisa Gasteen is again a generally reliable Brunnhilde, if not an interesting one. The subtleties of the role either elude her or appear in broad outline.There’s a lot more to be found, also, in Mime than Gerhard Siegel seeks out, but the best of what he does is along the right lines. Phillip Ens is a memorable Fafner and Ailish Tynan a likeable Woodbird, though Jane Henschel’s Erda is vocally less impressive. And why does Wotan kill her at the end of their scene?Some of Warner’s ideas are puzzling. Others work better, but there’s an overall lack of integration to Stefanos Lazaridis’ designs, which remain the weakest link.The strongest is John Tomlinson’s Wanderer, presenting Wagner’s words and notes superbly in a characterisation that will never be forgotten by those who witness it.

Dainty dance steps and sweeping courtly gestures emphasise his noble birth. Robert Hayward gives him physical dignity, an authoritative bearing and a degree of grace. This Falstaff is a big enough chap, but not obese. Hayward’s rich voice makes full use of the wit in Amanda Holden’s translation. He scores with every line.One of the great joys of the production is Susan Bickley’s performance as Mistress Quickly. Her knowing looks and asides are beautifully played and her vocal expression is delicious. Her meetings with Falstaff are superbly played and sung.Susannah Ford’s Mistress Ford sparkles and there is infectious glee in her plotting. Olafur Sigurdarson, as her husband, sings with relish and with some anger when needed. As for John Graham-Halls’ Dr Caius, audiences will be overjoyed when he enters.A sloping stage enables cast and chorus to be arranged with purpose. The clothes basket scene is admirably shaped, despite the stage being almost full. Laura Hopkins’ design comes into its own during Act III when the houses in a Windsor street are swung around to show the trees of Windsor Great Park. Stunning and well worth applauding.A highly recommended production. Lustily sung, magically lit and enjoying a fulsome measure of visual wit.

But it’s primarily in the individual performances and the music-making that Wagner’s own points are best set forth.Act I was hampered on the first night by the vocal indisposition of Stephen Milling’s Hunding, though his physicality is powerful on its own. Clive Bayley sang the role trenchantly from the wings. But the heightened lyricism of Eva-Maria Westbroek’s Sieglinde is close to ideal, while Simon O’Neill’s Siegmund has genuine Heldentenor authority, though he tired a little in Act II.Lisa Gasteen certainly has the vocal guns for Brunnhilde, a part she dispatches with naked energy and plenty of presence. It’s not a subtle or detailed reading, however – for that you have to look to John Tomlinson’s Wotan, which remains the lynchpin of this Ring. Though his vocalism is not ideal for the role – the part lies awkwardly high for him in places – his comprehensive understanding of Wotan’s dilemma is presented with consummate artistry and total commitment. He is without question a great exponent of the role.Antonio Pappano’s conducting once again shows a progression from a sequence of finely-wrought moments towards a resplendent overview, and the orchestra plays for him like Wagnerian heroes.

John Tomlinson retains the power and authority to deliver a memorable Wotan, a part he delivers in a complex and fascinating reading. Peter Sidhom’s Alberich matches him note-for-note in a grand and perceptive interpretation of the Ring’s chief villain. Philip Langridge’s busybody Loge commands attention whenever he’s on stage. Rosalind Plowright’s nervy Fricka is a powerful realisation. Only Jane Henschel’s Erda seems slightly undercast.Though some improvements have been made to Stefanos Lazaridis’s designs, especially in regard to Alberich’s transformations, the Nibelheim scene remains mystifying and the Rhine scene cluttered. But director Warner, who clearly knows the piece backwards, addresses Wagner’s political and moral arguments with insight and his entire cast knows what it is doing at every moment. Even with a rather cartoonish approach to the drama in places, it is impossible not to be gripped.Also on a higher level than before is Antonio Pappano’s conducting, which now not only delivers a sequence of great moments, magnificently played by the orchestra, but welds them together into one mighty structure that carries the listener along on an enormous surge of power.With demand as ever high for Wagner, a special student performance of Rheingold has been added on October 12 – not to be missed by those wanting to experience one of opera’s greatest achievements.

Papageno, the sensational Roderick Williams, is given the headpiece of a red-beaked bird, thus suggesting why Monostatos might take him for an alien presence. His stage business with the doves is sheer delight and Papagena (Susanna Andersson) is also in bird costume when she descends from the flies in a giant nest for the Papageno-Papagena duet. Jeremy Sams’ dialogue-heavy translation wears less well. Papageno employs Coronation Street demotic (until he sings) while the characterisation of Monostatos is so politically correct that he becomes a follicly challenged pantomime villain.The post-punk magnificence of the Three Ladies is sufficiently striking to mute the impact of Heather Buck’s Queen of the Night (her ENO debut) although her coloratura is hard to fault.There are engaging performances from Andrew Kennedy’s Tamino and Sarah-Jane Davies’ Pamina, plus a dignified, scene-stealing Speaker in Matthew Rose. That said, there can be no doubt that this is Williams’ night. His voice is quite lovely, expressive, warm and accurate, his diction immaculate. Brindley Sherratt’s dark, firm Sarastro impresses too even if a momentary slip brings co-ordination problems with the pit.A potentially disjointed show is otherwise held together well.

Under Edward Gardner’s discriminating baton Bizet’s score is given a world-class reading.Much of the singing is excellent. Alice Coote delivers a Carmen of vocal finesse, though her dramatic performance fades in the final scene, where she should blaze. Katie Van Kooten is an impressively lyrical Micaela, David Kempster a forthright Escamillo. Julian Gavin doesn’t suggest the fragmented personality of Don Jose, but he finds both the power and the delicacy to shine from a vocal point of view.So far, so good. But the visual and dramatic side of the show, in the hands of novice opera director Sally Potter, is a mess. It’s fine in theory to drop what Potter regards as Spanish tourist cliche – though there’s far more to the Spanish setting than that – but you have to replace it with something equally strong or the piece disintegrates. Jettisoning the spoken dialogue leaves the characters, their situations and motivations high and dry. Anyone coming to Carmen for the first time is going to have their work cut out trying to follow the plot. Here it’s impossibly vague and intangible.The tango dancing is pleasant but irrelevant. The hip hop in the final act is fun but belongs in a different show. Es Devlin’s variable sets don’t provide enough context. ENO audiences deserve better than this.

She is well partnered by Colin Lee in the Prince Charming role of Ramiro. His high notes blossom, his tone is liquid, and though his coloratura is a little smudgy, his whole performance is confident and likeable.As Baron Hardup (or, in Rossini’s version, Don Magnifico) Robert Poulton could do with more fat on the tone but in every other respect gives a thoroughly expert performance.The two ugly sister parts – Joanne Boag (Clorinda) and Julianne Young (Tisbe) – are all present and correct, and Roberto de Candia’s Dandini (alias Buttons) is inventive and energetic. There’s a decently sung Alidoro from Andrew Foster-Williams – Rossini’s fairy godmother is a man.But then the Rossini version isn’t a pantomime but a comic opera of elegance, wit and humanity, three qualities in short supply in this production by a Catalan team led by director Joan Font and designer Joan Guillen.It is colourful but brittle, with visual gags replacing acting and interacting. And the sextet of rats capering around is definitely surplus to requirements.Carlo Rizzi’s conducting is efficient but lacks sparkle. Definitely modified rapture at this particular ball.

This is not true, however, of Boris Materinco, whose powerful baritone voice is at its best in Nabucco’s period of all-conquering power rather than his descent into madness.He is well matched by Valeriu Cojocaru’s impressively sung high priest Zaccaria, although the outstanding performance of the evening comes from Galina Bernaz, admittedly in the showiest role in the opera, Nabucco’s scheming and bitter elder daughter Abigaille.

In the male ranks, Nicolae Busuioc’s Don Jose is a throw back to more traditional Moldovian opera stock, strong on tenor voice but only finding the passion in the role in the final death scene, while Petru Racovita’s Escamillo makes a stunning entrance with the best known baritone aria of all, The Toreador’s Song, but then rather fades away.One element of an Ellen Kent offering that does remain totally constant is the sturdy yet never domineering work of the Chisinau National Philharmonic Orchestra and chorus, here conducted by Gheorghe Stanciu.

Both in terms of technical skills and sophistication, The Sacrifice marks an advance on the previous work.Michael Symmons Robert’s libretto takes a story from the Welsh folk collection The Mabinogion and updates it to modern times. A marriage has been arranged by the General between his daughter Sian and his enemy Mal, though she herself loves Evan, one of her own people. Seven years later, at a ceremony to invest Sian and Mal’s young son Gwyn as a future king, the child is shot by Evan. In the final act, the General sacrifices his own life to avert a return to war.It is a tale succinctly told by Roberts and delivered with punch in Katie Mitchell’s clear narrative production, which makes a clear visual impact in Vicki Mortimer’s realistic designs. The cast is uniformly strong, though there’s not enough variety in either subject or setting, both consistently dark, to provide a rounded evening, and MacMillan’s ideas, though invariably apt and effective, aren’t always striking.But as a whole the piece holds the attention and clearly stirred the audience on the first night. The composer conducts with skill, and the new work is well worth catching as it tours England and Wales.

He manages to steal prize examples from museums with the aid of his girlfriend Francesca, who distracts attention by causing scenes. His activities eventually attract the interest of the police and psychologists, though ironically all the stamps are flushed down the toilet by his mother. In between, there’s a running commentary on the phenomenon of shopaholics, with testimony from members of a mutual support group.The scenes are not presented in time-sequence, which can be confusing, and even given the nature of satire it’s hard to feel much interest in the characters. The music doesn’t clinch matters either. It’s adroitly scored for a pit band of ten, and expertly conducted by Patrick Bailey, but it rarely seizes the initiative and doesn’t hold the attention. Too much of it is background.But there are compensations in the spick-and-span designs of Soutra Gilmour, with their large and lavish shopping bags, and in John Fulljames’s production, which addresses the back-and-forth narrative with skill. Above all the cast knows what it is doing, with a superlative performance from Darren Abrahams as Schmalhans. In a part that could easily go over the top he always manages to stay just this right side of the line.

In the title role, Anne Sophie Duprels is irresistible.Tim Albery has opted for sombre, austere staging, though having the story opening and closing in a night club dressing room is still puzzling, as is the identity of one alarmingly wigged character in the dressing room. Large sliding screens are pushed by the cast and there are sloping walkways. Not much more. No pretty costumes to coo over. The contrasts between two civilisations are made stark and insurmountable. Duprels sings warmly and hopefully and movingly, wrapping her words in absolute emotions. Her lack of vocal weight is not too apparent. What she has is musicality and exquisite expression. Her Butterfly is naive rather than submissive and is no more than an exotic diversion for her American lover Pinkerton. The sudden appearance of a holy man who condemns Butterfly is quite a shock.   Peter Savidge’s American Consul, the good guy in the story, is a reliable presence. Ann Taylor delights as Butterfly’s nimble maid Suzuki.The Opera North chorus is in good fettle, though when they all attend Butterfly’s wedding as her relatives, they do not appear to be doing anything. Even milling about at a wedding needs some choreographic guidance.What of Pinkerton, the scoundrel American? The amiable Rafael Rojas plays him rather amiably. Not an absolute scoundrel, more someone bewitched by the romance of the Orient and the delectable Madama Butterfly. But oh dear, what consequences.

It’s a hard piece to bring off.Above all, the declamation of the text needs passion and intensity, and without any French singers in the cast that is a tall order.In the vital title role, Susan Graham is all too cool as the tormented daughter of Agamemnon who comes close to sacrificing her long-lost brother, Oreste, until his identity is revealed at the last minute. More vocal colour and variety are needed than she can supply.More of these qualities are to be found in Simon Keenlyside’s performance as her brother and Paul Groves’ interpretation of his friend Pylade. Their scenes come through with some impact.As the barbaric King Thoas, Clive Bayley presents a one-dimensional villain and his tone is rough.But what really scuppers the evening is Carsen’s production, to monochrome designs by Tobias Hoheisel. Having the chorus sing behind the scenes diminishes their impact, while the endless black of both sets and costumes adds a spurious seriousness to proceedings missing in the staging itself. A show this long needs more some variety.The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment plays efficiently, but Ivor Bolton’s conducting lacks vigour. This piece is supposed to be one of the great achievements of eighteenth-century opera, but it doesn’t register as anything like that on this occasion.

The three Norns dressed in grey draperies sit together on a small hillock backed by a black night sky full of twinkling stars. They sing well too: Simone Schroder, Martina Dike and Edith Haller.Next comes the scene of Siegfried and Brunnhilde. It is the only time when they have any opportunity of happiness together, and Tankrea Dorst allows them more tenderness than is often shown.It is when we get to the Gibicungs’ Hall that Bright Ideas come to confuse the Wagnerite. This is a stately building of steps and walls which might be a palace, or hotel or a casino. Here Gunther (Ralf Lukas) struts about in a toy crown. He sings the part well, and Haller has a voice of outstanding beauty as Gutrune. The Gibichung trio is completed by Hans-Peter Konig’s vocally magnificent Hagen: a huge voice and powerful acting personality.By the second act the problems of the Gibichungs’ Bright Idea appear. Hagen summons the vassals in fine style, but they are the inmates of this building, almost entirely men in evening dress- tailcoats and boiled shirts. Amusing, but this scene loses much of its drama when Gunther drags in his protesting bride Brunnhilde, and later the oath for Siegfried’s death.The third act is where this Gotterdammerung loses its meaning. It was hardly surprising that Linda Watson was not at her best in the Immolation. The flames burn not a pyre nor Valhalla but the Gibichungs’ hotel. Frightened figures with suitcases run from it. There is no Rhine, no ring, no Rhinemaidens.

But even geniuses are not always perfect. Was it Thielemann who caused the first act of Siegfried to develop into something of a shouting match? It is rightly a lively, even noisy act, but this confused the action. Siegfried here is at his bouncy stage, but Wotan Wanderer has authority and humour in his guessing match with Mime. And Mime is wily rather than bullying.Stephen Gould’s Siegfried has developed a great deal since last year, and his is one of the finest Siegfried voices now singing. He can act too. Gerhard Siegel is no more than adequate as Mime, and Albert Dohmen missed the magnificence of the Wanderer’s scene with Erda (splendidly sung by Mihoko Fujimura) by pressing his voice to harshness.Andrew Shore as Alberich made a suitably evil entry into the second act. Tankrea Dorst’s production and Frank Philipp Schlossmann’s set have placed the forest scene under a road flyover, and it serves well as a frame for the singers. Act three, however, starts with the Wanderer and Erda in a thick fog, which rather downgrades the musically wonderful scene.Then the act returns to the ruined castle of Die Walkure where Stephen Gould, still in splendid voice, wakes Linda Watson’s Brunnhilde now in good voice also.

The real interest is that Endrik Wottrich has developed his uncertain Siegmund of last year into an impressively sung performance, although still rather woodenly acted. Adrianne Pieczonka’s Sieglinde is vital and beautiful of voice and person. Kwangchul Youn repeats his formidable Hunding.Act two is where Albert Dohmen’s Wotan suddenly acquires new life. He gives the notoriously difficult narration with a mastery that few Wotans achieve, though still without much beauty. Linda Watson is a lively, energetic Brunnhhilde.But it was left to act three to achieve the finest performance. Actors and singers as well as the audience know that there are fairly rare occasions when suddenly a performance takes off into the region of greatness, and it was so here.From the singing and acting of the scarlet-clad valkyries in the ruined castle to the lovely Sieglinde, valiant Brunnhilde, and above all Albert Dohmen’s Wotan. He revealed just anger and sorrowing tenderness for a beloved daughter, and he touched the heart of Wagner’s creation, Who Knows? He may become the Wotan of the 21st century.

Later scenes are less dramatic but serve well – broad steps for the mountain top facing Valhalla, a clinically white underground Nibelhein where one wall opens to reveal a dark, rocky cave full of gold.So much for the frame, which does not distract. Musically Christian Thielemann is in charge, and he is one of today’s finest Wagner conductors. Singing and acting vary. Albert Dohmen’s Wotan is tentative and makes little impression, Michelle Breedt’s Fricka is not much better, and hampered by a hideous costume, but others are excellent. Edith Haller (Freia) has a powerful and beautiful voice. Arnold Bezuyen is a brilliant Loge, Kwangchul Youn a moving Fasolt, and Clemens Bieber has the right beauty of voice for Froh.

These were revived in 1951, directed jointly by the two grandsons of the composer, Wieland and Wolfgang Wagner. Wieland died of cancer in 1966. Since then the whole responsibility has been given to Wolfgang Wagner, and carried to great success when every season the entire house could be sold out several times over, and the town has just announced it has 500,000 visitors each summer because of the festival.Wolfgang Wagner will be 88 at the end of this season so who will succeed him? There are several members of the family whose names are bandied about, but the most likely is Wolfgang’s younger daughter Katharina by his second marriage. Aged 29, she has been working with her father and mother Gudrun for several years. Now she has produced Die Meistersing von Nurnber as her first practical test.Would she play safe with the traditional approach, or be outrageously modern? Well, she has certainly not played safe, but her training at recent festivals has enabled her to produce a highly professional performance. Otherwise her approach has been to turn the character interpretation of the leading roles upside down. Walther von Stolzing the country-bred young aristocrat, becomes a wild teenager with a gift for painting who throws white paint over things and people, and appears much too young to think of marriage. He is sung by Klaus Florian Vogt who has a beautiful voice and youthful good looks. Michael Volle’s Beckmesser starts as a dignified citizen but also becomes a tomboy. Pogner (Artur Korn) is not allowed to make any impression at all. Amanda Mace is a rather bouncing, giggly Eva and Carola Guber as Magdalene is her shadow.David (Norbert Ernst) is a surprisingly buttoned-up (literally jacket buttoned to the chin) subdued apprentice.But of course the heart of the whole story is Hans Sachs, the strong, kindly, humorous shoemaker who has a gift for poetry and no less for understanding. Here Katharina has decided he should be some kind of unsure philosopher. He is not a shoemaker, and marks Beckmesser’s musical errors by bashing typewriter keys instead of hammering nails into shoes. He smokes cigarettes constantly and opens a bottle for refreshment while Stolzing sings after his dream. Franz Hawlata struggles manfully with what is clearly Katharina’s interpretation of Sachs and is not vocally impressive. Sebastian Weigle, however, conducted with real understanding of this great score, and the Bayreuth chorus was in fine form.Wolfgang Wagner has said that he is not making any decision about retiring at present, so there is really no reason for rumour and counter rumour.

So we have inscriptions in rather curious Arabic, Christian crosses, Hindu temples, a mixed crowd which includes a cardinal and men and women from most quarters of the world. The result is a muddle – not an exciting muddle, not an exotic muddle, just a plain ugly muddle which frustrates the meaning of the opera.It is to the great credit of the musicians that this is in the dimension of sound a fine Parsifal.Adam Fischer’s conducting maintains the power and beauty of the score, inevitably at variance with the stage. Robert Holl is in magnificent voice as Gurnemanz – a very fine performance against the visual odds. Alfons Eberz has a good, powerful voice for Parsifal and the same is true of Evelyn Herlitzius’ Kundry and Karsten Mewes’ Klingsor. Jukka Rasilainen is a strong and moving Amfortas.Throughout the performance there is a curious restlessness among the audience, an unspoken distaste. The final music is played accompanied by a film showing a vast dead rabbit in all stages of putrefaction.It was not surprising that the final curtain was greeted with violent booing from all parts of the house, changing to warm applause for the artist.

The youngsters regularly outshine international stars bashing their way through Rossini with smudged runs and little sense of style – no names, no pack drill.This year, Elisabetta Courir deftly adapted Emilio Sagi’s original staging to reflect the individual talents of the young performers. Ryuichiro Sonoda traversed the fizzing score with a rhythmic verve and a keen ear for Rossini’s subtle sonorities, while always supportive of the singers.The current crop of youngsters achieved a fine ensemble and played to each other with admirable generosity. Theirs was a performance of great wit and effervescence, though the women dominated the proceedings.Amanda Forsythe, the outstanding Corinna, is technically in command of the role. Required to sing her final aria from the front stalls, she delivered All’ombra ammena flawlessly with every run in place, the legato lines seamless, the vocal line expressively shaped in support of the text. It was perfection.Equally arresting was Marina Rebeka, who conveyed the sheer fatuity of the Contessa di Folleville without ever going over the top. Her cutting-edge soprano effortlessly surmounted the vocal hurdles, and needs only a touch more bloom to the tone. I’d love to see her play Donizetti’s La Fille du Regiment.Cristina Faus Vidal’s mezzo Marchese Melibea was a delight, but the fioriture can be sketchy. Tuomas Katajala’s Polish count hurtled around the staves with panache, but the voice is tonally hard-edged. Andrea Mastroni hammed it exuberantly as Barone di Trombonok.

A young woman bounces around on a bed, slots hollow tubes into box, and finally swings acrobatically above the orchestra. It is the Magpie, what follows is its dream. The bird’s ubiquity grates continually.But it enables Damiano Michieletto to transform an unsettling small-town tale of malice, oppression and family disagreement into a cliche-crammed, metaphoric spectacle about the horrors of Fascism. Designer Paolo Fantin’s massive scrolls metamorphose into tubular lighting, trees, gun barrels trained on the audience, and Ninetta’s prison.The corrupt Mayor, intent covertly upon seducing Ninetta, becomes a black leather-clad Scarpia figure commanding aggressive, Uzi-toting heavies. Fabrizio’s small-holding runs to countless servants. Act II is played upon a water-drenched stage – why? Michieletto’s fanciful ideas proliferate to the ruination of Rossini’s original masterpiece, which is not about the magpie acquiring a conscience as dream evolves into nightmare.Sadly, the singing is patchy. The Ninetta is too mature, with a flap to the voice which vitiates her undoubted artistry. Michele Pertusi’s Mayor rarely sings below forte.However, Alex Esposito brings a fiery abandon to the wracked Fernando, though he should nurse the voice more. Kleopatra Papatheologou’s vibrant tone humanises her stern Lucia. Paolo Bordogna’s warm baritone exemplifies her husband Fabrizio’s goodness. Manuela Custer’s Pippo outshines them all. She sings and acts to perfection.Lu Jia’s conducting is sensational too. He realises every nuance of Rossini’s glorious score, is indefatigable in support of the singers.

The composer has created a brittle, shallow bourgeois world typified by Fiorilla, whose flirtations – here with Selim, the Turk – are a testing of the limits of convention.When her older husband Geronio, no buffoon, finally disowns her in despair, Fiorilla’s genuine repentance becomes a victory for worthwhile values.Monticelli has coarsened his previously well-balanced staging by over-egging the ‘buffo’ elements to the detriment of the ‘dramma’. There are now banal chorus routines requiring funny walks, and an irritating suitor prone to pratfalls and similar unfunny antics. Comedy distorts into farce.Amazingly Alessandra Marianelli, in a heart-stopping performance of Fiorilla’s repentance scena, at a stroke rescues the character from the caricature she has almost become. Marianelli is an exciting young soprano blessed with a secure technique and an expressive way with music and text, needing only a touch more bloom to the tone.Andrea Concetti and Bruno Taddia are two young baritones also worth watching out for, their voices warm and centred, who sing meaningfully off words. Concetti resisted over-playing to create a sympathetic, Harpo-like Geronio. Taddia’s lean and hungry poet, Prodocimo, is an exuberant presence. Marco Vinco is the sonorous, preening Selim.Antonello Allemandi drove through the score with scant regard for the singers’ needs. Rapport between pit and stage was all too often precarious.

Camilla Tilling establishes the Governess as a well-meaning neurotic whose misconceived interventions exacerbate the unknowable complexities of the lives the two children at Bly. As the solid, sensible housekeeper, Mrs Grose, Anne-Marie Owens maintains some level-headedness amidst the encircling gloom.Emma Bell’s Miss Jessel, whose ghostly appearances identify her as a lanky-haired, drowned Goth, is seriously intense. William Burden’s Peter Quint lacks some of the vocal colour and allure that must seduce the audience as well as (perhaps) Miles, but he sets the opera’s torture-wheel in motion with a well related prologue.Both the children – Joanna Songi’s feisty Flora, and Christopher Sladdin’s highly ambivalent Miles – are excellent, setting the audience’s imaginations racing. But we never really uncover the truth in Kent’s 1950s production, and it is right that we should not.Paul Brown’s sets conjure up the various internal and external locations in this secluded, secretive country house and flow nicely from scene to scene. Mark Henderson’s lighting adds plenty of atmosphere in all the right places.But finally it is Gardner’s conducting and superb playing from members of the London Philharmonic that ratchet the tension up to fever pitch.

Giancarlo del Monaco deploys nine Iago clones to trundle around trucked doors, resembling cupboards or Portakabins, within a vast sky-blue enclave adorned with clouds and seascapes.And so it continues. He choreographs the hapless cast to negotiate and eavesdrop behind doors, agitatedly to open and close them. In the striking Otello/Iago Act II scena, Iago sabotages the Moor’s jealous outpourings by playing peek-a-boo round them.Worst of all, del Monaco destroys the harrowing prelude to Desdemona’s murder by relegating the singers to opposite front-stage corners while the clones manoeuvre doors centre-stage to create a tomb. He renders the remarkable score an irrelevance, mere garnish around his pretentious, anti-theatrical visual metaphors. The staging is a disgrace.An exceptional cast and conductor miraculously transcend the crass direction. Renato Palumbo conducts an urgent reading which subtly realises the score’s often remarkable sonorities, which generates a tragic inevitability powered by a finely sprung rhythmic momentum.Olga Peretyatko charts Desdemona’s escalating entrapment with a gestural economy and vocal agility always at the service of music and text. So too Juan Diego Florez’ impassioned Rodrigo, whose stratospheric vocal lines and fearsome divisions he shapes with expressive power. Rossini’s genius is served ‘con amore’.Equally gripping is Jose Manual Zapata’s baleful, gloating Iago. His Act I encounter with Rodrigo is both hair-raising and insidious. Ferdinand von Bothmer, a dramatically charismatic Otello, was nervous in his opening Cavatina but hit full vocal stride by Act II. Maria Gortsevskaya impressed as Emilia.

A prince falls in love with her and marries her, but his jealous sister breaks the tree’s branches and maims her. Kumadha becomes a deformed outcast, and the prince a beggar. Long afterwards he meets Kumudha again at his sister’s palace, recognises her voice and restores her to perfect human form by pouring over her a ritual pitcher of water.The device of having a constant narration, well delivered as it is by Eric Owens, diminishes emotional involvement. Jessica Rivera and Russell Thomas are both effective as Kumudha and the Prince respectively. These two roles are doubled in danced form, gracefully conceived and executed. The chorus – the Schola Cantorum of Venezuela, splendidly dressed in Gabriel Berry’s exotic costumes – are marvellous.But this is not among Adams’s more memorable scores. It feels too long for its material, with too great a preponderance of slow music, though some of it is undeniably beautiful. Unlike Nixon in China of The Death of Klinghoffer, however, one can’t predict a long future for it.

It’s a major event for Wagnerians, and is already sold out. But it delivers much of the goods in an impressive account of one of opera’s greatest challenges.The Brangane is new, and Katerina Karneus provides fine tone and a concerned manner as Isolde’s companion. Most the rest is as before. Neither Nina Stemme’s Isolde nor Robert Gambill’s Tristan would make a full impact in a larger theatre, but at mid-scale Glyndebourne they do, aided by the attentiveness to balance of conductor Jiri Belohlavek, under whose baton the London Philharmonic play marvellously. His is not an ideally long-breathed Wagner – the music needs to enfold in larger, even act-long paragraphs, which it doesn’t – but the Wagnerian sound-world is finely realised.Prime among the cast is Rene Pape’s gloriously sung, deeply involving King Marke, which could not be bettered today. Bo Skovhus’s Kurwenal is strong and clear.Nikolaus Lehnhoff’s production is a serious piece of work, though some of its incidentals – notably Andrea Schmidt-Futterer’s fussy medieval costumes – look too artificial. Strong in presenting the larger narrative sweep of this super-rich drama of love and death, it’s less good when focusing on individual scenes, especially the substantial duets and the lengthy monologues, which need moment-by-moment definition of the character’s internal and external thought-processes. The broader picture is already there.

However their award-winning team superbly conquered most of its complexities whilst an excellent cast provided the icing on the cake.Jamie Hayes’ energetic production never faltered with much use made of the auditorium and the various levels of Elroy Ashmore’s chunky wooden set.Simon Hutchings’ clever lighting saw an elegant crystal chandelier in the ballroom scene, replaced by strings of coloured lights festooned around the stage and auditorium for the wedding sceneDashing George Von Bergen was in great voice as the charismatic Don Giovanni, commanding the stage and making it understandable why the ladies were so easily duped by him. The audience loved George Matheakakis as the manipulative Leporello although vocally he appeared to hold back.Piotr Lempa was imposing as The Commandatore, whilst Teit Kanstrup and Oliver Kuusik made a mark as Masetto and Don Ottavio.Sophie Angebault made a striking Donna Elvira whilst Bylgja Dis Gunnasdottir began well as Donna Anna, conquering a tendency to force the high notes, to give a much  improved second half. Anna Graca looked and sounded good as the pretty Zerlina.Sung in Italian, with English surtitles, by arrangement with the Royal Opera House, Musical Director and Conductor Anthony Legge was completely in control of the fourteen piece orchestra capturing the nuances within the score and making this another triumph for this small company which prides itself on quality productions.

Elaine Kidd chooses the 1920s. This gives her design team and choreographer, Sarah Fahie, plentiful opportunities without necessarily elucidating the moral and social rigidities that oppress the protagonists. With minimal changes between acts, and an intelligent use of back screens, the Holland Park stage looks uncommonly elegant in black and marble. For Act 2, Scene 2, Flora’s Parisian house is differentiated with a bold arboreal design running the width of the stage. A faux-marble plinth becomes Violetta’s sofa bed in Act 3. The lighting is well-handled throughout, the singing perhaps less happy. Kate Ladner, having sung the heroine at the Sydney Opera House, finds it difficult to convey her character’s vulnerability in a small space. Her big, ringing voice and healthy physicality impress rather than move and can seem a little beside the point. Sean Ruane is vocally out of sorts as Alfredo, the authentic timbre and sensibility coming but fitfully, the dramatic focus needing more work too. Robert Poulton is not ideally steady as the older Germont although his sympathetic characterisation works well. Under John Gibbons the orchestra (reduced by half in Tony Burke’s version) copes with adverse sonic circumstances; the weather, at least, has improved. Voices are smothered by over-projected winds in the early stages, probably an acoustic effect of the revamped venue that will not affect every seat. Surtitles are visible to all via two separate screens placed high above the stage. The text is projected in unhelpful Amstrad green.

At first it seems the evening will have a strong, simple purpose, to contrast the banality of corporate jargon with genuine individual self-expression. To this end, various permutations of roots music as chosen by participants in the project are skilfully arranged by Orlando Gough.Forty odd performers stream on to the bare stage dressed as conference delegates and their games with posture and the manipulation of limited props work well. Gradually however, focus and meaning drain away with every kind of lingo, fashionable commitment and cultural friction referenced as a means to take us from one musical sequence to the next. The liveliest musical encounters include an Italian partisan number, a sea shanty, multiple nursery rhymes and a superb rendition of Take this hammer, an Afro-American slavery song. The multi-ethnic quality reminds us that our most vulnerable unhoused citizens are often immigrants or asylum seekers.Alas the show runs out of musical steam well before the end, not necessarily assisted by the curiously straight-faced treatment of Donald Rumsfeld’s ‘known unknowns’ speech. The whole thing is designed and lit effectively and economically but remains perilously like experiencing a concert at which someone has left Radio 4 playing fall blast in the next room.

It takes place on the Greek island of Syros, the opera performed in an enchanting 350-seater theatre modelled on La Scala in Milan.This year, its third, the festival presented a gala concert of Italian operatic hits prefacing a staged performance of Mascagni’s engaging one-acter, Zanetto, almost certainly composed to comprise a double bill with the later Cavellaria Rusticana.The gala revealed Tiboris to be a fine conductor. The overtures went with a swing, while he was a considerate colleague to his singers.Highlights included Todd Geer’s deftly shaped Cielo e mar (La Gioconda), firm of line and free at the top; and William Power’s powerful, deeply moving performance, the more harrowing for its restraint, of Philip II’s great soliloquy ‘Ella giammai m’amo’ (Don Carlo).Zanetto is a two-hander, in which Silvia (“a widow and poor”, as she describes herself), yearning for true love, meets romantically with the wandering musician Zanetto, in thrall to freedom. She declines his offer to remain with her. The opera is a lightly sketched discourse on right choices in life.Mascagni’s deft, seamlessly tuneful score, not yet verismo, aptly traces the libretto’s subtextual implications, important since the work is largely a talk-piece. Jennifer Larmore, singing with warm, vibrant tone, successfully catches Zanetto’s knowing yet attractive youthfulness.Sadly, Carel Castel’s direction is anonymous. Movement seems arbitrary, the lighting fidgety, the set comprising cut-out flats unromantic. A festival offering requires sharper definition and rather more flair.

The trilogy is based on early, experimental morality tales by Thornton Wilder. While each begins with subtle and precisely imagined instrumental textures, soon joined by offstage vocal keening, the musical and theatrical outcomes are various – and variously obscure. The last panel, The Angel on the Ship (1995), is the most accessible, reminiscent of Henze in its eager, energizing embrace of vernacular Latin music and demonstrating the fickleness of our spiritual moorings with some humour, though not everyone will like the broad West country accents. The austere central treatment of The Angel that Troubled the Waters (1994) is more problematic. The message would seem to be that healing comes to the wounded from the wounded or perhaps that angels are ill-equipped to assist with illnesses that stem from within. It proves difficult to define the composer’s attitude to either proposition. As throughout, the vocal writing, hampered no doubt by the cramped acoustics of the venue, seems overwrought and over-projected by the singers. The second piece takes place at a sanatorium pool. Otherwise the staging relies on a grey curtain and strobe effects to suggest stormy seas. Richard Bernas directs an Almeida Ensemble full of first-rate players and there’s no mistaking the commitment of Jane Harrington in particular. Brigomédié, her insistent mermaid  in Leviathan (1986), is evoked with the help of one washing-up glove and some rudimentary green lighting.

Yet again it works brilliantly as an ensemble staging, with finely honed performances in each of the six principal roles, and gives full value in terms of the humour and emotional depth of this most ambiguous of operas.  Despite not sounding in her best voice, German soprano Dorothea Roschmann goes to the very heart of Fiordiligi. Her sister on this occasion is Latvian mezzo Elina Garanca, making a sensational Covent Garden debut as Dorabella. Glamorous both in voice and looks, she fields a remarkable dramatic performance whose wonderful range of facial expressions matches her superb singing. From the servants’ quarters, Welsh soprano Rebecca Evans moulds a perfectly formed Despina, scintillating, streetwise and savvy. The men, too, are exceptional. American tenor Matthew Polenzani supplies rich, honeyed tone for his main aria, and works perfectly in tandem with Italian bass-baritone Lorenzo Regazzo in the comic routines. Pulling the strings is Thomas Allen as Don Alfonso. A bit diminished in voice these days, he nevertheless personifies the complex and sinister cynic who wrecks other people’s lives in a performance that holds the audience in the palm of his hand. Colin Davis’s conducting is a little slow to get into its stride, but when it does the show takes off and holds the attention without any let-up.

What unfolds is a folk-like legend, in which we meet Hasan’s older brothers one driven by greed, the other by war and the servant Sevda, for whom Hasan harbours affections. A white witch weaves a magical family scarf, which gets torn three ways as the brothers come to blows. The rest of the opera concerns the piecing together of the scarf by Sevda, before realising that Hasan has disappeared; whereupon we see her present-day incarnation searching for him at the demolition site.If the scenario seems straightforward on the surface, there’s a deeper mystery and symbolism which is evocative but oblique; but Osborne manages in the music to seamlessly incorporate the sevdah, Balkan scales and upbeat dances with his own contemporary idiom. Often it’s the last that’s most beguiling, with often mesmeric writing especially for clarinet and accordion, who play alongside members of the Mostar Sinfonietta.The singers are strong all round, particularly Monica Brett-Crowthers’s Sevdah, Andy Morton’s middle brother Balkan, and the unwaveringly focused stage presence of Mladen Vasari as the oldest-brother, Zlatan.On a single hearing it doesn’t quite feel as if everything is pulling in the same direction, but a joy in creating new music theatre and the excitement of a new collaboration there certainly is.

The French philosopher, born to an agnostic Jewish family in Paris in 1909, lived a life of increasing asceticism until she virtually starved herself to death, dying in a sanatorium in Kent in 1943, at the age of 34. Her writings, mostly published posthumously, offer perceptive reflections on human life and suffering. For many, Weil, who went through a period of Marxism before fully developing Christian leanings, is something of a saint.The problem with this UK premiere performance is that the work proves unstageable. Soprano Dawn Upshaw sings the central role, which considers Weil’s mystical statements from a later period and at other times seems to personify her physically. The sole other figure on stage is the dancer Michael Schumacher, whose role is partly to support Weil and partly to push her along her road to an end that partook of a kind of death wish.Director Peter Sellars cannot make of this something dramatic. Nor is Upshaw the actress to aid him. Even her singing is limited in expression.Robert Spano conducts the CBSO, with London Voices providing the excellent chorus and the voice of Dominique Blanc speaking the texts. Ironically, this fine musical account would work better as a concert piece.

The mottled, tilted-facade set could be marble, as befits the court setting, or it could be eroding sheet metal, reflecting the decaying morality as the Duke and his couriers pursue their hedonistic pleasures. Darkly lit throughout, the undercurrents of Monterone’s curse, Rigoletto’s obsession with his daughter’s protection and the wavering loyalties of court politics co-mingle to climax in the last act’s storm-driven murder scene. McVicar has revelled in the grotesque and it makes for a compelling story.In the title role, Franz Grundheber fails to project the extremes of Rigoletto’s mocking court-jesterly duties and his private fears as well as Paolo Gavanelli in 2001 and 2006, and he occasionally sounded tired at the top. But South Korean tenor Wookyung Kim makes a thrilling Royal Opera debut as the Duke, matching his onstage machismo with vocal effluence. There’s never the hint of him holding back, and so physical and overwhelming is he as he declares attempts to win over Rigoletto’s daughter Gilda, that he practically seduces and deflowers her with his voice alone.For her part, Patrizia Ciofi’s Gilda is winsomely naive, a daughter in transition between her questionless devotion to her father and a desire for worldly experience. Raymond Aceto maintains a rock-like presence as the assassin Sparafucile and Czech mezzo Jana Skorova makes a notable debut as his sister Maddelena.Added to this, the Royal Opera orchestra is on fervent form, conducted with immediacy by Renato Palumbo, and so too is the chorus, whose impossibly hushed Zitti, zitti chorus is breathtaking.

In place of Antonio Pappano’s lava flow of emotion and lavish use of portamento, Mikko Franck provides a grand, texturally refreshing rethink, cooler in every sense.Violeta Urmana, formerly a Wagnerian mezzo, makes a strong, proto-feminist Tosca, banishing memories of the demure Miss Gheorghiu and her frocks with a performance of terrific punch, fine detailing – and less flattering costumes.Salvatore Licitra’s Cavaradossi begins poorly with a tight and constricted Recondita armonia. Later, the voice thrills, but does not move. Though indubitably idiomatic, its vocal colouration and dynamic levels seem rather limited and the easy warmth of Marcelo Alvarez is much missed.Byrn Terfel played Scarpia as a lascivious thug. That take proves now to be part of Jonathan Kent’s conception for, fine as he is, Mark Delavan is no more believable as a suave aristocrat harbouring sadistic tendencies. No matter. Paul Brown’s extravagantly literal designs continue to impress in the split-level church and imposing study of the first two acts. The third remains a puzzle: the Castel Sant’Angelo is sketched in without elaboration save for the ominous apparition of a gigantic wing above the ramparts, imperceptible from the cheaper seats and of uncertain symbolic import. The brief preamble with shepherd boy, a role Franck himself sang as a child in Helsinki, is almost invisible in the effective but characteristically gloomy lighting. Nor is there much of a parapet from which the defiant Tosca can leap to her death as dawn, most evocatively, breaks.

The subject is interesting enough: George Bridgetower (1768-1860), virtuoso violinist and son of an ex-slave father. The opera follows the young Bridgetower as he is presented to the Prince of Wales and is taken under royal patronage. There’s a distinct sound of the musicals as the scenario hovers around Bridgetower’s love for the slave girl Mary Prince (the first black woman to publish a book in England), though the climax relates not to newfound love, but with a bicentennial nod to the 1807 Abolition of Slavery Act.There’s potential here in the clash of Regency Windsor and the black underclass, and in Joseph’s jazz band as opera orchestra, but Joseph’s series of songs and choruses  though individually appealing stunts the development of narrative and, alongside Mike Phillips’s libretto attempts to cover too many bases: is this about the slave trade, Bridgetower’s social rise, a love story, or Bridgetower’s shortlived friendship with Beethoven (in which role Joseph himself makes an entertaining piano-pastiche cameo).It all leads to a rambling evening that doesn’t quite gel. But Joseph makes fine use of a focused and well-directed LSO St Luke’s Community Choir; and a great band with a naturally leading role for the brilliant jazz violinist Chris Garrick. What really saves the evening are the voices and stage artistry of Cleveland Watkiss, the adult Bridgetower whose every phrase oozes instinctive musicianship, and Jacqui Dankworth, the persecuted yet feisty Mary Prince: both were seamless, inspiring bridges between jazz and classical, black and white.

It’s an eerie tale – the sisters communicated almost exclusively with each other, and became both stifled by and yet dependent on each other in extremes.The first part of the opera relies heavily on flashbacks from earlier in the twins’ lives – a consultation with a bemused doctor, their enrolment on a writing course, losing their virginities in a church on their 18th birthdays. And yet just when you feel you want more of relationship to each other there’s the poignant scene where, having been forced apart in hospital for a period, they are brought together again, only to declare their hatred and then their love for one another .Wallen’s music – skilfully wrought and freely idiom-crossing – largely makes light of the twins’ situation, with varied set-pieces in the ‘Discomania’ scene (where disco dancing drives subjects to wild violence) and the smoky jazz accompaniment to the ‘Pepsi-Cola Addict’ high-school hero, seduced by his teacher. But the delicately keening wind writing before the end of part one, where the sisters declare their love for each other, and much of their mother Gloria’s writing, is deeply affecting.Alison Crookendale and Talise Trevigne are well matched vocally as the twins and are well supported, particularly by La Verne Williams as their mother, and especially by Andrew Rees in a number of sharply characterised guises.

It proves a winner. The story of the officer in the British army who falls for the daughter of the Brahmin priest, who opposes foreign rule, has dramatic potential and a tragic end when Lakme takes poison on Gerald’s decision to return to his regiment.The score itself is shapely and imaginative, with a succession of delightful numbers and some appealing ballet music. Conductor Noel Davies needs to give it more impetus, especially in the slow passages, but it charms the audience.So does Tom Hawkes’ sensibly traditional production, which includes the ballet sequences (ably choreographed by Jenny Weston) and pursues the narrative with skill. Peter Rice’s designs evoke time and place vividly, and his costumes are colourful.On a particularly wet opening night, neither of the two lovers sounds at their best – Allison Bell’s Lakme is brittle of tone, and does not suggest the innocence of the young priestess. Philip O’Brien’s Gerald offers an impressive sense of style, though his voice sounds inhibited.But there are impressive performances from Grant Doyle as Gerald’s fellow soldier Frederic, Graeme Broadbent as Lakme’s implacable father Nilakantha, Robert Burt as her servant Hadji and Antonia Sotgiu, her partner in the famous Flower Duet. Overall it’s a likeable show and the score is a genuine treat.

Dunblane or Beslan have been suggested as templates. Vicki Mortimer’s single set creates the context accurately.The problems start with the chorus, which spends the evening seated as grief-stricken parents at one side of the stage. Musically their entries are often untidy and one misses the crucial presence of a strong treble line. But dramatically, for all the artificially contrived business they’re given, they are an inert mass. There’s nothing very dramatic about this, nor about the equally fussy representations of sorrow and anger offered by the soloists allotted Bach’s static arias. This isn’t Bach’s fault; he wasn’t writing an opera, nor can his work be shoe-horned into one.There are many musical compensations along the way, including some outstanding playing by the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment under conductor Richard Egarr. A lot of the singing, too, is eloquent, especially from Sarah Connolly, Christopher Purves and Mark Padmore’s Evangelist. But the staging seems based more on sincere admiration for the work than any realistic view of its limited dramatic possibilities.

He’s fearless in his vocal athleticism and heroic enough in character to mask the role’s difficulties. Frances Bourne, is equally agile, with a uniform silkiness across her range that makes her a joy to hear, but her Rosina is more a daisy than a thorny rose, leaving her unconvincing in the sting-in-the-tail of her Una voce poco fa.Eric Roberts is a robust, charismatic Bartolo and Matthew Hargreaves and Sarah Redgwick impress as Basilio and Berta. For his part, Figaro -sung by Toby Stafford-Allen, returning to OHP for the third consecutive year – is fully in bloom vocally and dramatically.But Tim Carroll’s production plays down the characterisation of Rossini’s stock comic characters, leading to one of the least funny Barber’s you’re likely to see. The great ensembles of comic confusion feel deflated and underanticipated. It’s a novel touch that Carroll invents a boy assistant to Figaro who, hidden beneath Almaviva’s cloak, plays guitar for his serenade and organ-accompanies the singing lesson he gives in disguise. But this is not without removing another comic role, that of Ambrogio, the (silent) yawning servant of Bartolo.Robert Dean conducts the City of London Sinfonia with vim and the new semi-permanent theatre structure is stunning (save for the eye-straining dot-matrix surtitle displays).This is still an enjoyable night out, but go for the singing, not for the laughs.

But there’s a lot to enjoy, even if the ironic tale of the fanatical fourth-century monk who converts a courtesan to Christ, falling in love with her in the process, then losing her to an ecstatic death, needs a slap-up production to make its impact.Andrew Davis’ conducting is too circumspect, missing out on the frank hedonism and both the emotional and spiritual extremism of the score.Renee Fleming delights her fans in the title-role. It shows her at her best, with impeccable tone, easy vocal command and some long, liquid lines. Yet there’s a dramatic limitation; she’s only halfway there in her exploration of the character and text. But she looks a dream.Standing in for Thomas Hampson, Simone Alberghini is disappointing as Athanael. His voice is monochrome and he never suggests the demeanour of this screwed-up religious fanatic.The evening’s finest performance comes from Joseph Calleja as Nicias. It’s not a long role but he makes it a star turn with immaculate singing and a fine suggestion of the wealthy young playboy who just wants to have fun.Robert Lloyd is in tepid voice as Palemon, leader of Athanael’s desert-dwelling religious sect, and it’s a lukewarm evening as a whole, although along the right lines.

The victorious characters finally prove that only a heavenly life can offer relief from Time’s ravages.In Netia Jones’s bold production for Transition Opera, Beauty and Pleasure – staggering on to the stage during a night on the razz – seem utterly inseparable, making Beauty’s final allegiance actually surprising. Their first duet becomes a karaoke duet, with the surtitles cheekily highlighted on the large rear screen. Time, sung passionately and with sensitive colouring from Andrew Staples, appears in various guises – stay at home father, priest, notary and doctor, while Disillusionment is his ever-pregnant wife. Marie Elliott in this role brings a serious richness to the low-lying part, belying her deliberately plain persona. On first night Mary Nelson was battling illness, though you wouldn’t know it, and Gail Pearson lit up Wilton’s lively acoustic with a ringing coloratura.Video – live, manipulated, recorded – is central to this production, and even the surtitles are artfully displayed, if sometimes a touch early. Ultimately this tends to take over, but it’s so skilfully directed – as are the ‘real’ characters on stage – that it adds layers of drama to the rightly static staging. The result really is a happy synergy of ear-opening singing, crisp yet probing playing from Christian Curnyn and his period-inclined ensemble, innovative video art and the remarkable raw, experimental space of Wilton’s Music Hall.Go and see it.

It is so once again in this new production directed by Martin Duncan and designed by Francis O’Connor, which holds some tricks up its sleeve. The late arrival of the god Bacchus – strongly sung by John Horton Murray – brings an imaginative visual expansion as the back of the set reveals the god’s seaborne entrance in full classical splendour, and there really is a firework display, in the famous Garsington gardens, to close the performance.But this is more than just a good-looking show – it sounds wonderful too. Duncan’s ingenuity draws all the elements together into a perfectly constructed whole. Orla Boylan is both grand and funny as an Ariadne possessing a soaring soprano. Wendy Dawn Thompson shows us the heartfelt sincerity of the young composer who fears his work will be massacred. Elizabeth Cragg’s Zerbinetta scintillates in her famous showpiece aria, and the troupes of commedia dell’arte clowns and nymphs are both impeccable. Conductor Elgar Howarth, long the leader of a sequence of important Strauss revivals at this venue, proves the ideal exponent of the enchanting score.

However, shortly before the first previews, choreographer Javier De Frutos quit the production “because of creative differences”. This disharmony could have affected the ensemble’s morale, and as for the musical staging (Nikki Woollaston) and retained choreography, they are either non-existent or at best messy.For a start, the show, and in particular the libretto, seems incredibly dated. There are some amusing moments as we watch the poet and his daughter seek out their happy endings in a tale of mistaken identity and fate, but on the whole the book is pretty dull.In addition Griffin’s direction is all over the place, the result being the ensemble appears uncomfortable in under-rehearsed scenes. Ultz’s sets – all red panels, curtains and cheap backdrops – do nothing to evoke the colours and passions of 11th century Baghdad.At least there is a little redemption in the luscious score played by the accomplished orchestra led by Richard Hickox.Surprisingly Tony Award-winning Faith Prince makes little impression but the sweet-voiced young lovers (Alfie Boe and charming Sarah Tynan) do well to add some much needed emotion to the whole affair.Thank goodness also that Michael Ball is on hand as the poet to inject a much needed professionalism and life into the proceedings.He is in fine voice and demonstrates a natural talent for comic timing.Kismet is only set to reside at the ENO for a limited run, thank goodness because this production is certainly not worth the ticket price alone.

The orchestra employs period instruments, the famous overture enlivened by glittering harpsichord and eagerly thwacked timps as well as some inauthentic onstage scene-setting. Also to feature: natural horns, honking bassoons and touches of vocal ornamentation. The single set is minimally furnished, a green-tinged, Amtico-floored parlour with a back section that lifts to reveal the garden of Act Four. Though costumes, fixtures and attitudes are re-imagined for our own time there’s nothing forced about the results: timeless values are respected and refreshed. With standards sky-high it is invidious to single out members of the young, international cast. That said, the Susanna of Norwegian soprano Silvia Moi is a palpable hit, as feisty and strong as the production demands. Making his UK debut in the title role, the soft-grained Swedish bass-baritone, Markus Schwartz gains in authority as the evening proceeds. New Zealand-born Anna Leese makes an unusual Countess; her diamond-clear thread of sound, capable of great things, may need careful handling. Ronan Collett is more sympathetic than usual as the Count while Sally Harrison’s Marcellina plays frumpy without caricature. Rebecca Ryan’s Cherubino, decked out in high heels and handbag for the cross-dressing of Act Two, delivers physical comedy with aplomb. All ends joyously with lanterns, sparklers and a modest firework display. With everything so cleanly focused under artistic director Ian Page, it scarcely matters that the surtitles are barely visible.

The sets are too unvaried, with the ruined building in Act III far too cramped, weakly defined interiors and – crucially – no River Volga. But what goes on within these sets in this revival directed by Andrew Sinclair is altogether more worthy.In the title role, Janice Watson sings expressively and conveys the character’s fragility and suffering as an unloved wife and tormented daughter-in-law. Her chief persecutor, mother-in-law Kabanicha, is vividly realised by Felicity Palmer, on caustic form. Chris Merritt describes effectively the weakness of Katya’s mother-dominated son, Tichon, while Kurt Streit suggests both the attractiveness and the lack of moral fibre inherent in Katya’s lover Boris, who fails her when she needs him most.The smaller roles, too, are effectively done. Kazakhstani bass Oleg Bryjak is bold as brass as the brutal village bully, Dikoj. Toby Spence supplies boundless enthusiasm as Kudrjas, who finally manages to escape the stifling provincial backwater by fleeing with his girlfriend Varvara, knowingly acted by Linda Tuvas.These performances provide one of the reasons for heading for this revival of Janacek’s deeply moving, intensely lyrical work. The other is the conducting of Charles Mackerras, who presents the score’s beauties and sheer sonic punch with the greatest possible conviction.

No surprise that the movement is so beautifully articulated, but the cast’s groupings and general direction are also spick and span. That they are able to perform in such a magical environment as designer Lez Brotherston’s enchanted forest, and in his immaculately realised children’s story book costumes, is much to their advantage. Tim Mitchell’s lighting and Chris Full’s sound design add to the impact of the special effects. Rarely do Covent Garden’s main auditorium shows look as good as this.The mix of actors, musical theatre performers and opera singers works well under the expert baton of James Holmes, and there are some wonderful performances. None better than Beverley Klein’s comprehensively fine Witch, a study in technical know-how, but Peter Caulfield is an endearing Jack, Gillian Kirkpatrick a demure and sentimentally appealing Cinderella, Anna Francolini determined as the Baker’s Wife and Suzanne Toase scrumptious as Little Red Riding Hood.Clive Rowe needs a little more focus as the Baker and Gary Waldhorn’s Narrator more command. One or two of the ensembles in this trickiest of Broadway scores could do with more precision. But taken as a whole, this is a wonderful presentation of a fascinating piece, and surely merits a return to the Linbury after this short run ends.

This time the period instrument Orchestra of the Age of the Enlightenment is in the pit, playing under Glyndebourne’s music director Vladimir Jurowski, with effortless sparkle and unflagging energy.Alessandro Corbelli is convincing as the buffoon Don Magnifico – the down at heel Baron, desperate to marry off either of his two daughters to Prince Ramiro, while his stepdaughter, Angelina (La Cenerentola), is left to the domestic chores.Though a touch on the straight side, Raquela Sheeran and Lucia Cirillo sing well as Clorinda and Tisbe, the ‘ugly’ sisters. And Umberto Chiummo makes an effective presence as Alidoro, the Prince’s tutor and ‘talent’ scout.But it’s the central trio of characters that excels. Romanian soprano Ruxandra Donose returns as Angelina, dark-hued in her mid-range and though lacking a little brightness at top, amply agile. Her Prince, Maxim Mironov, sings with bright, creamy lyricism and impressive stamina. But Pietro Spagnoli makes an exceptional Glyndebourne debut as Dandidni, the valet with whom the Prince temporarily swaps places in order to observe the women. With an easy flowing richness and instinctive comic and dramatic expression, his is, perhaps, the most complete performance.There are some gripes though. Cinderella seems all too knowing, Ramiro a touch limp, and the asides to the action – usually the ensembles – take place amid bizarrely disorienting and increasingly tedious lighting changes. And then there’s the embarrassingly awkward slow motion finale to Act I… On the whole, however, the singing, playing and (mostly) the production are so sure-footed as to bring the thing off with panache, if not with abandon.

It’s a consistently beautiful score, including many early romantic touches in its exploration of the history of Elena, the eponymous lake-dweller of the title, and her several admirers. Some of the spirit of previous Garsington Rossini comedies, however, seems to have got into David Alden’s production, Gideon Davey’s designs and Ben Wright’s choreography, with a touch of excess at the entrance of the female chorus – half Valkyrie-like warrior maidens, half Belles of St Trinian’s – in the Act 1 finale. Yet it’s undeniably witty, offering an ironic parallel rather than a direct match to the music. Rossini’s serious operas are notoriously difficult to sing, and if nobody here gets every note they all acquit themselves impressively. Carmen Giannattasio offers grace and charm in her shaping of Elena’s lines, Colin Lee has spot-on top notes as Giacomo (alias James V of Scotland) and if Michael Colvin cannot quite manage the vocal extremes as Rodrigo his is a valiant attempt. Most consistent is Alexandra Sherman, who sings the role of Malcolm with authority and makes Alden’s punk lesbian characterisation work well. David Parry conducts, showing a thorough understanding of the style and content of the piece and sending it springing out into the auditorium.

That said, no-one can pretend that its statuesque characters have the whiff of real life so apparent in the Da Ponte operas. This makes it problematic to stage. David McVicar’s dark, atmospheric production, now enjoying its first revival, will satisfy those who believe in the piece. With much use of the revolve, Yannis Thavoris’s clever, handsome sets are subtly lit, cast members picked out in shafts of light. Musically things are sure-footed rather than inspired. Edward Gardner secures efficient, vibrato-lite playing from his orchestra. The star turn is Emma Bell’s Vitellia. Her voice has grown in size and quality while her brave attempt at a psychologically plausible characterisation commands respect. Alice Coote is indisposed but gives us her Sesto. Physically slight for the role – it doesn’t help that she is costumed in an old nightshirt – she has intonation problems in Act two though her diction is exemplary. Anne Marie Gibbons’s Annio is also good with words, even if her metallic timbre should confine her to portrayals of witches and grandmothers. Sarah-Jane Davies is a touching Servilia. Paul Nilon repeats his noble, idiosyncratically voiced Tito. Towards the end his outsize toga gives him trouble (is this metaphorical?) and simpler Mozartian verities are undercut by an implication that the anachronistic Praetorian kendoka resent his [act of] clemency.

From this rigid, masculine world, through which the chorus dourly parade, the pure romance of Lucia’s affair with the Jacobite Edgardo can rise, free and incandescent, in the voices of the singers.It is hard to see at first, literally in the twilight, but as romance and tragedy blossom on wings of belle canto, rising above and shedding light on the politics and intrigue of arranged marriage, this amounts to a most satisfactory telling. While Sally Silver, as Lucia, and Bulent Bezduz, as Edgardo, ensure that this is really something rather special on the ears.If Andrew Schroeder creates a necessarily abrupt character in Enrico, Lord of Lammermoor and Lucia’s brother, there is nothing obvious about his follower, Normanno. On stage nearly throughout, Nicholas Ransley’s voice might reflect the weakness of the character, but there is menace in him too as he lurks behind columns, spying on Lucia like a would-be lover who is not brave enough to even be spurned.Things open and lighten up for wedding scene, with Adriano Graziani putting in a pleasingly warm performance as Arturo, to whom Lucia has been betrothed. But it is Lucia and Edgardo’s arias that linger in the mind. Silver’s voice pure yet having maturity and depth, while Bezduz audaciously flits about the music with ease and grace.

There is plenty of natty tailoring, although lurid green satin does nothing for our Countess, the prize-winning Katherine Broderick.More troubling is the curious lack of intimacy and grace. Everyone seems to be working too hard. The orchestral playing is technically not all it might be, in what is a very difficult score, but why does the conductor press so insensitively through some of its most exquisite instrumental passages? He pulls everyone safely through the challenging vocal ensembles yet, with rubato strictly rationed and pianissimos at a premium, he loses the autumnal glow essential elsewhere.Katherine Broderick, who will surely have a great career as a Wagner soprano, lacks the mellifluous timbre and aristocratic bearing for this kind of role. Chloe De Backer’s Clairon is actressy in a way that doesn’t quite ring true. Likewise Philip Gerrard’s hardworking, comedic La Roche. Are they simply too young?The competing lovers sing well enough, especially Bragi Bergthorsson’s Flamand, but without much expression or range, they seem as wooden as the set. One nice conceit is too small to be seen from most of the seats. The model theatre with which La Roche demonstrates his plans is subsequently turned to reveal a miniature version of the stage we’re looking at. Undersized English surtitles may vex older patrons.

But his hedonistic relish as opera’s leading sexual obsessive, combined with the imagination and colour of his singing, make him its outstanding exponent today.He’s surrounded by a strong cast. Kyle Ketelsen seconds him admirably as a lowlife Leporello and their duo-scenes are impeccable.Marina Poplavskaya stands in early as Donna Anna due to Anna Netrebko’s illness. Much of her singing is superb, though there’s the odd tentative moment. She’s well partnered by Michael Schade’s finely vocalised Don Ottavio, and if his character remains a stick that’s presumably intended.Ana Maria Martinez returns to Donna Elvira, and delivers the role with more aplomb than before. The peasant couple – Sarah Fox’s Zerlina and Matthew Rose’s Masetto – are excellent, with Rose in particular making his mark. Reinhard Hagen’s Commendatore sounds a little out of sorts.In one of his infrequent Royal Opera appearances, conductor Ivor Bolton balances the score immaculately though it could do with a little more impetus. But the show will be remembered for Schrott’s unbeatable Don. He’s not to be missed.

While the earlier opera sees the Marchioness disguise herself as a common gardener, in Il re pastore the lowly shepherd Armyntas is found to be the legitimate King of Sidon, whom Alexander the Great seeks to restore to power.However, Alexander’s magnanimous plans extend to marrying Armyntas off to Tamyris (whose father Alexander has deposed) inadvertently scuppering Armyntas’s betrothal to Elisa and Tamyris’s affections for Alexander’s nobleman Agenor.Annilesse Miskimmon’s debut production for Garsington works effortlessly against the loggia of the Manor, and draws in the adjacent flower garden as an extension of the stage, not least when some of its shrubs make an entrance as Alexander’s disguised soldiers.Mixing ancient Greek and 18th-century costumes to strong effect and replete with well-judged comic touches, including an episode featuring Alexander’s bumbling chariot carriers, the production is sure-footed. As the huge golden arrow at the rear of the stage reminds us, Il re pastore is also about the constancy of love: to this end there are both joyous and touching scenes between the two pairs of lovers.The brilliant cast features Cora Burggraaf’s youthful, agile Amyntas, Lucy Crowe’s fruity, well-supported Elisa, Thomas Walker’s ardent Agenor and Iain Paton’s ringing Alexander, all deftly conducted – along with the Garsington Opera Orchestra – by Steuart Bedford. Even the celebratory fireworks at the end seem to be well timed and well behaved. This is a distinguished, unselfconscious production, well worth catching.

He composed it during the First World War, but the Russian Revolution intervened before a promised production and he revised it before its belated premiere in 1929.It’s not frequently performed – the last UK staging was by ENO in the eighties – and it’s a challenging work for Grange Park to take on, with a large cast and large orchestra.The latter is taken care of by the presence of the Orchestra of St John’s, who play marvellously under the baton of Andre de Ridder.The cast is full of expert singing actors of the likes of Andrew Shore as the scurrilous old General, Carol Rowlands as his elderly aunt – who takes to the tables like a fish to water, and Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts as the General’s tutor, who suffers an on-off relationship with the General’s flaky stepdaughter, Pauline.They do a good job, though Lloyd-Roberts ideally needs a heftier tone and Katherine Rohrer is a shade muted as the unstable Pauline. But they’re not a sympathetic lot and it’s hard to engage with them.David Fielding’s self-designed production is a well-crafted piece of work, though needs a bit more excess to match the wildness of the score. But the latter is not – at least for the right reasons – among Prokofiev’s most memorable.

Yannis Thavoris’ designs are sparse, but generally effective. Director Olivia Fuchs keeps a sharp eye on the plot, allowing her attention to slip only when the chorus are on stage – the Moravian dances lack spontaneity in Clare Whistler’s choreography.But two of the main performances are marvellous. Anne Mason inhabits the deeply religious Kostelnicka, giving her terrible decision to murder her stepdaughter’s baby credibility, and her resultant guilt huge poignancy. She is in superb voice.So is Tom Randle as Laca, the mixed-up brother of Jenufa’s Steva, who takes on Jenufa after Steva chickens out. Randle gives three dimensional life to this complex, ultimately sympathetic man, and his tenor rings out boldly.In the title role, Anne Sophie Duprels doesn’t quite dominate the vocal picture as she needs to, and neither do the character’s strength and determination quite ring true. But she’s undeniably touching.Aldo Di Toro makes a presentable showing as Steva, his keen acting skills highlighting the man’s feckless, spoiled-brat nature.Well co-ordinated playing from the City of London Sinfonia under Stuart Stratford, though Janacek’s violence is occasionally softened down too much.

Nor is local wildlife deterred by the installation of a high-tech canopy. But these are all part of the feelgood experience that is Holland Park Opera. Nabucco is not stereotypically festive. Even before the action begins, suitcases emblematic of the refugee experience litter the long shallow stage against an angled curtain in dingy brown.The opera proper starts with some effective tableaux of Thirties-ish refugees in Hassidic black. Things then take a decidedly post-Modern turn with the arrival of Babylonians re-imagined as menacing, book-burning circus artistes. Guards double as jugglers, costumes are ceaselessly bizarre and John Fulljames keeps everything on the move. What’s lost is the essential dignity of the piece. Still, Maria Pollicina throws everything into her Grand Guignol Abigaille. Hers is not an intrinsically attractive instrument but she has the range to cope with the role’s unforgiving tessitura. David Wakeham’s Nabucco, a literal Lion King, is slow to build, keeping power in reserve for his big scenes. Paulo Pecchioli’s Zaccaria is more convincingly Italianate, despite youthful looks and some missing low notes. Andrew Rees’s Ismaele shines in an underwritten part.Each of the show’s four parts is preceded by a biblical motto delivered, apparently without irony, in English. The rest is surtitled. Brad Cohen’s energetic, unfussy conducting both guarantees superfine coordination between stage and pit and draws the best from orchestral principals in moments of repose. Big choruses are delivered with passion notwithstanding the carnival mask worn by the rest.

It doesn’t hurt, of course, that the work is a masterpiece – Dvorak’s dark fairytale Rusalka which, unlike Wexford’s usual programming, is in the repertory of many companies worldwide.But few will complain, because Wexford does it proud. Most important is the marvellous conducting of Dmitri Jurowski, who turns the orchestra into an inspired unit and really shows how wonderful the score is. As son of Mikhail and brother of Vladimir, here is another outstanding conductor in the family.To this, add some exceptional voices in the major roles. Bryan Hymel thrills as the Prince, Iveta Jirikova is a daunting, powerful Foreign Princess, Andrew Greenan is a rich-voiced water sprite and both Katerina Jalovcova’s witch and Helena Kaupova’s Rusalka are memorable. In a surprising addition to the cast, David Greeves’ special aerial talents make something remarkable out of the moon.Director Lee Blakeley seizes his opportunity with a production that would appear a distinguished piece of work on any stage, charting a fascinating and consistent course through the complex possibilities of the tale. Joe Vanek’s sets and costumes are among the finest seen on the Wexford stage in recent times. All in all, it’s a show that returns to Wexford its reputation as a centre of excellence.

Stravinsky’s neo-classical ballet of 1922 precedes Ferruccio Busoni’s one-act parody opera of 1917.They work well paired together. Director Lucio Dalla and choreographer Luciano Cannito place Pulcinella’s antics in mid 20th century New York, showing his rise from Wall Street pickpocket to Wall Street financier. It admittedly takes Pulcinella a long way from his Italian roots but the choreography is finely executed and Alessandro Riga brings plenty of charm to the title role. David Agler’s conducting needs more crispness and the songs are delivered with less charm than they deserve, but the visuals maintain consistent interest and the dancing is entertaining and often imaginative.Busoni’s Arlecchino is an altogether more consistent success, with a characteristic Tuscan town square recreated in Italo Grassi’s set and the whole crew of commedia dell’arte stereotypes fleshed out by a lively cast led by Marco Alemanno’s sparky Arlecchino. Dalla’s staging captures the menace as well as the uproarious comedy of a piece that seems determined to unsettle as well as amuse.Musically, Arlecchino proves to be a delightfully rich and quirky score, into which Busoni pours plentiful operatic parodies to create a distinctive mix that remains entirely his own. The result is exactly the kind of worthwhile rarity that Wexford specialises in – a tried and tested formula at its best.

Pending its completion, Wexford Festival Opera moves this year to the summer, and to a temporary theatre built in the grounds of Johnstown Castle, outside Wexford itself. This interim measure works brilliantly.Which cannot be said of the opening production, director Keith Warner’s take on the Kurt Weill/Georg Kaiser collaboration Der Silbersee. It’s a piece that has inherent problems. A play with music, whose ratio of text to score is entirely in favour of spoken to sung words, it’s a thin evening for Weill fans. Even then, not all of his score is memorable.The symbolic, socially concerned book presents the over-hasty policeman Olim shooting a hapless pineapple thief and then, having come into money, trying to make amends by housing the now disabled Severin in a luxurious castle. Evil hangers-on boot them out to seek a better life by walking over the frozen (and deeply symbolic) silver lake.Instead of concentrating on the work’s humanistic vision, Warner goes for low laughs in this version translated by Rory Bremner. They are few in coming, and the general standard of singing, dancing and even acting is depressingly low. Anita Dobson is a parody as the wicked Frau von Luber. Nina Bernsteiner doesn’t sing strongly enough to put over some of the better numbers in the show. It’s a very long night.

Jurgen Flimm’s visualisation, which cuts great swathes of dialogue, is modern in tone. There are guns aplenty on stage as Marzelline’s admirer Jaquino is particularly trigger-happy, apparently getting away with holding one to Rocco’s head at one point.But there is little conviction in Robert Murray’s performance, any more than there is in Ailish Tynan’s overwrought Marzelline. They look imposed via the production book rather than worked out in collaboration with the individual artists.This lack of focused detail is all too general. Even the normally incisive Eric Halfvarson seems half-hearted on this occasion as Rocco. Terje Stensvold is someway there with Pizarro, but a sharper cutting edge to the voice and a darker tone are really needed. Nor does Robert Lloyd’s Don Fernando have the vocal amplitude it should.There are compensations in Endrik Wottrich’s genuinely heroic Florestan and at least partially, in Karita Mattila’s Leonore. Granted that she looks a little old to convince the other characters that she is a young man and that the role is vocally at least one size too big for her, she goes for it.Musically, there is some sketchy playing, especially in the overture and some untidy choral singing in the final scene, despite the presence of Pappano in the pit. But the real problem is the lacklustre staging, which could have been bettered by a local team.

His reading combines finesse and nuance with dynamism, and makes for a magical performance of the score. How the company will be heartened by his advent.One of his tasks must be to address diction, which has yet another mixed night. But the company’s ongoing Britten series is strengthened by Deborah Warner’s powerfully atmospheric and articulate production, which shows her on superb form. The narrative comes over strongly, the individual acting performances are distinguished, and the varied moods of the piece and its Venetian ambience wonderfully suggested in Tom Pye’s superb sets, Chloe Obolensky’s immaculate period costumes, and Jean Kalman’s endlessly evocative lighting.Ian Bostridge suggests Gustav von Aschenbach’s isolation and gradual loss of control with skill – if only he had more colour in the tone. Peter Coleman-Wright pulls off the feat of creating the seven characters who push Aschenbach along his fatal path with enormous aplomb. Iestyn Davies brings an unearthly quality to the Voice of Apollo, made palpable by his appearance on stage (the role is usually sung offstage), though his deity needs some kind of visual representation.The dancers define another mode of existence that Aschenbach longs to share, with Kim Brandstrup’s choreography matching Britten’s oriental sound world perfectly. All in all a great night for ENO, and for Britten.

Mozart’s comedy may be serious, but it’s still a comedy, and laughs are slow in coming in the first half, at least. But Vicki Mortimer’s period designs retain their Neapolitan appeal.It’s odd that one of the weakest members of last year’s sextet – Ainhoa Garmendia’s charmless Despina – is back, though the other, the Don Alfonso, has been replaced. Like his predecessor, Alfonso Antoniozzi fails to stamp his authority on the show – he is the motivator of the action, after all – and occasionally, he sings flat.All the rest are new. Rachel Harnisch’s gaunt Fiordiligi struggles with some of the notes, but Israeli mezzo Rinat Shaham brings personality and Mediterranean sunshine as Dorabella.The young men are good, with Stephane Degout a personable and forthright Guglielmo and Pavol Breslik handsome in voice and looks as Ferrando. His singing is the vocal highpoint.Robin Ticciati, 23 years old and now music director of Glyndebourne on Tour, conducts. His is a skilful performance, and he’s clearly in command of his forces. Occasionally there’s a want of momentum – the notes are all there, though they’re not flowing strongly enough. But it’s more than promising. The rest is acceptable and often more, yet it’s not the equal of last summer’s production, nor of last autumn’s touring version, which was superior to both.

There’s less precision, perhaps, than when the show was first seen, but it still packs a memorable punch, while Ultz’s designs have their own manic authority, even though the sets have been slimmed down for touring purposes.The weak link in the cast is Russian soprano Svetlana Sozdateleva as Lady Macbeth. She lacks stage presence and makes little impact dramatically. In addition, she quite often sings out of tune. Verdi did not demand a beautiful voice for the role – in fact he said it would be inappropriate. But this particular soprano does not fit the bill under any heading.By her side, Stephen Gadd’s Macbeth is a tower of strength. Not only is he in perfect vocal command of the role, but there is plenty of nuance both in his singing and his acting. His realisation is an exceptional achievement.Notable also are Ilya Bannik’s strongly sung Banquo and Stefano Ferrari’s equally vibrant Macduff. But the chief factor in the evening’s success is the young conductor Robin Ticciati, now Glyndebourne on Tour’s music director. He shows a keen understanding of Verdi’s style and knows how to propel the rhythms without ever hurrying them. His performance, ably seconded by the chorus and orchestra, not only reveals what an exceptional score this is but also fully justifies his appointment.

Emmanuel Clolus’s sets present a sequence of boxes that open to reveal the visual motif for each scene. In Raoul Fernandez’s costumes the residents of Allemonde wear silvery decorated tops with puffed-up sleeves that look like leftovers from a West End pantomime. The characters face the audience more than each other and the characterisations and connections between them lack definition.Sir Simon Rattle is in the pit and under him, this most delicate of operas has colour and atmosphere though not enough momentum. The result is Debussy-lite.Pelleas depends more than most operas on a youthful pair of lovers at the centre and Philippe Berthome’s lighting does not flatter Covent Garden’s couple in this respect. But Simon Keenlyside’s Pelleas is sung with imagination and insight, while his acting is the finest on the stage. Angelika Kirchschlager’s Melisande comes over as hard whereas the character must register as vulnerable if the piece is to work.There’s a strong Golaud from Gerald Finley, his incomprehension impressively etched in his stance and line. Robert Lloyd’s Arkel has gravitas if not enough voice and while Catherine Wyn-Rogers delivers a purposeful letter scene her costume looks particularly silly. George Longworth is marvellous as the child Yniold. But overall it is a muted interpretation of the symbolist masterpiece, let down by weak visuals and surprisingly, by the conductor.

Aletta Collins’ positioning of the dancers, the major characters and the chorus gives both stories emotional clarity and strength. For Les Noces, which is sung in Russian, the orchestra is on stage and is augmented by four pianos.Stravinsky’s Les Noces has been called a sung ballet. Based on Russian folk wedding traditions it is given explicit sensual energy by the dancers and an on form chorus.Six exquisite, long-haired maidens enter, wistfully and playfully, to bless the bride. Then the young men prepare the groom. The dancing is spirited and expectant and ultimately ravishing.The choreography is less pronounced in Purcell’s Dido and Aeneas but it has importance. Positioning, movement and physical reaction add clarity and power to the tragedy.The mezzo- soprano Susan Bickley makes a magnificent Queen Dido, Adam Green’s Aeneas rather less so. The soprano Amy Freston excels as the Queen’s confidante Belinda. Her voice is effortlessly clear and she has sweeping grace and purpose. Clarissa Meek’s Sorceress is a richly defined study, as is James Laing’s fetching Spirit.These short operas may seem a curious selection, separated as they are by two hundred and fifty years. The themes of love and marriage are a tenuous link but it is the contrasts between the two which make this programme so pleasurable.

Offenbach’s 1855 Les deux aveugles is staged with a new libretto by Michael Flexer as The Two Blind Men. A ribald, streetwise satire on dishonesty and attitudes to homelessness, it makes a brilliantly entertaining start, even if Flexer needed to fit his words more closely to Offenbach’s rhythms.The remaining two items are both UK premieres. Rothschild’s Violin was begun by Shostakovich’s pupil Benjamin Fleischmann, but completed by the master himself after its originator’s death in the Second World War. Based on a tale by Chekhov, it shows the mean-spirited musician Bronze reconsidering his life and making a final redemptive gesture by giving his violin to Rothschild, whom he has persecuted. Jonathan Brown attacks the central role with vigour, and the piece strikes home forcefully.Last comes Martinu’s 1928 The Knife’s Tears, a Dadaist fantasy in which Satan attempts to seduce Eleonora with her mother’s complicity. The piece proves fun, its jazzy score highly attractive.Simon Holdsworth’s effective designs peel back as each opera is completed, and Oliver Mears’ stagings hit three nails on the head. Conductor Nicholas Chalmers draws superior playing from a sixteen-piece orchestra. The company is strong. Once again Second Movement shows itself capable of remarkable things. Let’s hope they can expand their activities.

Somehow the sound of the solo piano and the clarity of the voices help to point up the music and the libretto.Heading an international cast is Greek George Matheakakis, who is a real find. His rich baritone is ideal for the Don. In his early 30s, he adroitly avoids any caricature of the sprightly 70-year-old and plays him as a distinguished gentleman hungry for love as well as money. Brazilian Mario Solemene, is also good as the manipulative Dr Malatesta who eventually, resolves everything in the end.Andrew Mackenzie-Wicks sings Ernesto whilst Ella Kirkpatrick as Norino shows some nice comic touches and her voice improvs in the second half.This delightfully fresh production is a promising start to the season and will also be performed in the newly refurbished St George’s Concert Room in Liverpool.

Partly this is because the score which, although finely composed as always with Britten, is not one of his best. Some of the characterisations of the central figure’s militaristic family also register as one-dimensional.Yet it is a worthwhile piece. For this revival, Covent Garden has commissioned a scaled-down version of the orchestral score to fit the confines of the Linbury. While it is a dubious practice to tamper with the work of a master, David Matthews’s chamber version is expertly done and generally effective, though at times some of the piece’s colour is blanched out.Tim Hopkins’s production, set in the original Victorian period and benefiting from some imaginative filmic elements (also Hopkins’s work) does not solve all the problems – the dramatic performances almost all need sharpening up – but it does handle the supernatural element well and the narrative strikes home. Particularly impressive are the talented young South African baritone Jacques Imbrailo in the title role, Elizabeth Woollett’s sensitive Mrs Coyle and Vivian Tierney’s inflexible Miss Wingrave.In the pit conductor Rory Macdonald presides over members of the City of London Sinfonia, who maintain a high standard of playing. It is not quite enough to turn the fortunes of the piece, which once again registers as a flawed if fascinating example of Britten’s late style.

But the scrutinising inhabitants of a small Russian town are acutely observed in his production, while Hildegard Bechtler’s mottled designs – mostly variations on dark green, sensitively lit by Peter Mumford – point up the oppressive atmosphere of a community whose outmoded conventions stifle the tragic heroine.Katya is sung by Giselle Allen. It is her finest performance to date, though the role takes her to the limits of her lyric soprano and words could sometimes be clearer. But her presentation of a married woman on the edge, finally pushed over by the combination of an illicit affair and her vicious mother-in-law, is superbly realised. So is Sally Burgess’s Kabanicha, the mother-in-law from hell, with Burgess never failing to humanise a potentially one-note character.Peter Wedd excels in his portrayal of Boris, Katya’s lover, whose swift exit from the town after she has publicly admitted their affair makes Katya’s suicide inevitable. Noteable also is John Graham Hall as her feeble, dipsomaniac husband, Tichon. But there are no weak links in this marvellous cast.Nor are there on the orchestral side. Opera North’s ensemble has a great evening, achieving wonders with Janacek’s difficult but emotionally powerful writing under the baton of the company’s music director, Richard Farnes.

Then it disappeared for more than a century, though the composer made a radically revised version called Aroldo, which never caught on.The plot tells of a Protestant minister whose wife, Lina, has had an affair. This throws their community into turmoil, until in a moment of divine inspiration he publicly forgives her by reading the gospel story of the woman taken in adultery during a church service. Almost all of these plot elements were considered explosive when Verdi wrote the piece.Set in the American Bible Belt in the late 19th-century, Elijah Moshinsky’s 1993 production, imaginatively designed by Michael Yeargan and Peter J. Hall, creates a credible ambience for the piece and is clear and effective in getting the drama over. His cast is solid, with Jose Cura a tower of strength as the preacher Stiffelio and Sondra Radvanovsky grand if vocally unyielding as the troubled Lina. Roberto Frontali gets under the skin with his boldly sung account of Lina’s father, Stankar, who eventually exacts a fatal revenge on Raffaele, her seducer, played by Reinaldo Macias.Conductor Mark Elder leads a dynamic performance, though ironically the piece itself, for all the fascination of its unusual plot and even more unusual stage history, registers least strongly as a musical experience; the score is not one of the composer’s best.

The staging relies on a single set strewn with geometric shapes on which the protagonists assume conventional, front-facing operatic poses. It is the introduction of a choreographic element in the form of four omnipresent dancers, a crowd-pleasing response to intransigent material, that does not really come off.Plainly affected by the resonant, dignifying songs of his own workforce, a variant of Delius’s static, post-Wagnerian idiom takes centre stage, the best music coming when the action is over. There are some memorable choral tableaux en route and the orchestral playing, though variable, can be sensitive too. Leonard Rowe is effective in the title role, ably supported by Alison Buchanan’s mature sounding heroine. Mezzo Yvonne Fontana makes something of the underwritten role of Clotilda. The acoustic prevents much of the text coming across so why no surtitles?Early performances of the opera were given in blackface: in this sense at least things have moved on.

The subject is Gandhi’s period in South Africa, where he formed the idea of satyagraha – resistance to oppression by non-violent means. The libretto (by Constance DeJong and Glass) is sung in Sanskrit, though some of the text’s crucial passages are projected onto the walls of Julian Crouch’s set.This is not a simple narrative opera. Gandhi’s campaign to achieve respect and equality for South Africa’s Indian community between 1896 and 1913 is presented out of sequence, with the contemplative aspects of his work given as much prominence as the actively political. In addition, his inspirations – Tolstoy and the poet Tagore – as well as Martin Luther King, on whom Gandhi had a major impact, are long-term presences providing a wider visual context.Visually this is a hugely impressive show, with the Improbable team of highly skilled physical actors, puppeteers, aerialists and others creating sequence after sequence of striking and beautiful imagery. Kevin Pollard’s period costumes are spot-on and Paule Constable’s lighting subtle and varied. The cast, led by Alan Oke’s exceptional Gandhi, is strong, while ENO’s overall musical standards are high under conductor Johannes Debus.The great weakness is the score. At its most memorable in the first act – although even there Glass’s endless repetitions prove wearisome – but later on, simply tedious.

His attitudes towards Harry Nicoll’s nicely obsequious Goro and Garry Magee’s increasingly exasperated Sharpless tell much of that guilt and add even greater piquancy to Act II.Rebecca Nash brings her considerable acting and singing talent to the role of Butterfly. Here, with the necessary lightness of vocal touch, she creates a 15 year-old girl who is also the embodiment of mature womanhood. Her suicide is not capitulation, but the extinguishing of love itself by Pinkerton’s actions.Such insightful depth is matched for the most part in the singing and playing. Only in the Act II trio does Francesco Corti’s clear conducting of the Orchestra of Scottish Opera lapse, pushing the voices before it, rather than illuminating them. The company’s now mercenary chorus are less clear. Their invasion and retreat in the wedding scene adds none of the threatening atmosphere that would highlight Butterfly’s isolation.

For L’heure espagnole, John Macfarlane’s painted pink upholstery and chilli-pepper fabric design make clear that, although all we see is the clock-maker Torquemada’s shop, the overriding concern is with his sex-starved wife Concepcion’s hopes to bed a lover upstairs while her husband is away.Vocally suave and a physical hunk, Christopher Maltman is the perfect Ramiro – the visitor Concepcion at first busies with clock-moving chores before she realises to her gratification there is another way he can deliver the ding-dong upstairs.Christine Rice dresses more trampily than she perhaps behaves, but Yann Beuron combines vocal richness and skincrawlingly Austen Powers-esque orange attire to powerful effect. As the mistakenly thinks-he-still-has-it Don Inigo Gomez, Andrew Shore triumphs with bright singing and pinsharp comic gestures. Director Richard Jones transforms the final quintet into a surreal dream sequence with a troupe of spangly feather dancers. Neither this nor the opening device of the forwards-gliding set are necessary, but they add a dimension of fantasy.The moving stage, this time receding, becomes a framing device at the end of Gianni Schicchi, after the eponymous town rogue – brilliantly sung and acted by Bryn Terfel – has duplicitously cut himself a slice of the Donati family inheritance. With a faded 1950s design, again by Mcfarlane, this also boasts a fine ensemble cast, with an especially heroic Rinnucio (the young Albanian Saimir Pirgu) and the chesty, rich-voiced Elena Zilio as the aunt Zita. The music of Gianni Schicchi shows off Pappano and his orchestra to best light, concluding a memorable evening.

The project originated in a commission for a straightforward concert work which the Greek-Canadian composer, Christos Hatzi has pushed towards narrative-free music theatre. There exists an audio-only CD version, weaving sacred and secular, pop and high art threads but what substance there is in its ecumenical East/West message of cultural convergence – Constantinople as shared crossroads of the spirit – needs some kind of theatrical presentation to reconcile the disparate elements.The set features three lamp-like objects, hanging across the stage at different heights, with a specially adapted version of the same positioned stage left, where it accommodates a glass bowl partly filled with water and, later on, cellist Roman Borys. A series of mesh screens fills up with installation art images, both naturalistic and emblematic, from the curved arches and blue tiles of Islamic design to an imaginatively achieved multicultural panorama of faces. While stage movement is rudimentary, the singing – whether Middle Eastern or classical in style – is top notch. So too is the playing of the piano trio, whose electronic touch-screens ensure that no page-turning or extra lighting is required to illuminate the notes. From time to time, the results are mixed with electronic sounds.Alas, the vacuousness of the concept is reflected in the score itself. Played without interval, its eight sections offer a random mix of world music and minimalist influences. The John Tavener-style orientalism is predictable, less so the tedious gloops of 19th-century pastiche and pseudo-Piazzolla.

This two-act comedy was, like most of the others, produced when he was a teenage prodigy, though it had a full-scale premiere in Berlin in 1827 before disappearing from musical history.The plot is taken from an episode in Cervantes’s Don Quixote, with the aged knight and his sidekick Sancho Panza involving themselves in the marital plans of Quiteria, who wishes to wed bright young thing Basilio, though her father wants her hitched to rich but dull Camacho instead. Naturally, there is a happy outcome and some highly skilled and attractive music on the way. But it is no lost masterpiece.Nevertheless a cast of mainly young professionals make UCL Opera’s production enjoyable, even if diction in the dialogue is occasionally lost. The opera is sensibly sung in English, courtesy of John Warrack’s translation.Best of all is Duncan Macfarland’s production, to simple, witty and distinctly colourful designs by Christopher Giles, that give the piece an apt and stylish Spanish period flavour. Well known for his work as a choreographer, Macfarland strikes a hit here with a lively, well-paced show that frames the main action with a child and his nanny reading the old story of Don Quixote. The entire company carries it off brilliantly, while conductor Charles Peebles gives it musical energy and precision from the pit.

He liberates the captured Poro – who has disguised his identity – treats Poro’s captured sister with respect, sensitively dodges the duplicitous advances of Poro’s lover Cleofide, forgives his general Gondarte for disloyalty and ultimately restores throne and Cleofide to the would-be assassin Poro.If some of the scenario seems farfetched – there is very little fighting or ruling going on, and the three subsidiary characters are fictional – this didn’t prevent a successful initial run, and two revivals, in Handel’s time. The music is hardly as consistently vibrant as that of the earlier Julius Caesar, and some key dramatic moments seem to pass in the flash of an eye but this rarely performed work proved a worthy launch for this year’s London Handel Festival.If Nathan Vale makes for a vocally robust Alexander, bringing out the role’s heroism, then Christopher Ainslie contrasts this effectively by sustaining a deep sense of desperation, generated by his cankerous jealously. Madeleine Pierard’s makes a good impression as Poro’s sister Erissena, especially in her action-halting pastoral Act III aria, but Ruby Hughes excels as Cleofide, with spring-loaded consonants and finely shaped vowels. Hakan Ekenas’ resolute bass allows us to lament the relative slightness of Timagene’s role. Cowell’s production may expose the stilted drama for what it is but many will appreciate his inclination not to direct heavy-handedly. A rare revival well worth catching.

Rising to its considerable vocal challenges are Julia Sporsen’s Iolanta, who suggests her character’s blindness without resorting to cliche, Allan Clayton as Vaudemont, her charming prince, and Dong Jun Wang, whose singing as the prince’s friend Robert steals the show.Strong support comes from Piotr Lempa as Iolanta’s father, King Rene, Teit Kanstrup as the Moorish physician Ebn-Hakia and Richard Rowe as Almeric, though there are no weak links in a high-powered line-up.Bringing the evening to a witty conclusion is Puccini’s dark-edged comedy, and its zest and black humour come over strongly in Orpha Phelan’s pacey production, effectively and economically designed by Leslie Travers. Thorbjorn Gulbrandsoy carries off brilliantly an unusually serious portrayal of the lovable rogue who fixes Buoso Donati’s will partly for the dead man’s relatives, mostly for himself, with Claire Watkins a knowing and sweet-toned Lauretta and Xing-Wa Hao a stirring Rinuccio. There’s some keen ensemble playing and singing from the large supporting cast, among whom Kristen Darragh stands out for her finely judged and never overplayed Zita. A very impressive evening all round.

He himself received a desperate love-letter that ultimately led to his disastrous short-lived marriage. Amanda Echalaz’s intense delivery of it here is a highlight of James Conway’s production for English Touring Opera. She is partnered by an equally convincing Onegin in Roland Wood, whose stalwart, bullish presence creates the hint of an impenetrable mask to his true emotions.Vocally the pair are very fine, which sadly isn’t true of Michael Bracegirdle’s Lensky – though his emotional engagement is strong – and he shows himself capable of subtle shading in the lower range. Nearer the top and at higher volumes there is an unattractive shrillness.While the costumes and choreography aim at a period piece, the set – an angular reflecting screen – suggests some antagonistically modern symbolism. But is the reflection for the benefit of the characters, whose actions are involuntary rather than considered (in the same way that Tchaikovsky felt compelled to accept the attentions of his letter-writing, suicide-threatening admirer) or for the audience, as if to offer a further angle of objectivity?Thereis an overall feeling of barrenness that hardly supports character relationships and yet fails to illuminate with any psychological commentary. Completists may be perturbed by some cuts, but nothing of dramatic significance is removed.In the pit the ETO orchestra under Michael Rosewell is as responsive to the dance music as it is to ardent lyricism, and buzzes with textural detail.

It impresses as before with some fine music, especially in the third act, where a great chaconne seems to bind the whole score together. But doubts remain about the piece’s long-term viability, though fewer about this performance.The composer conducts a score containing some vivid orchestral writing with confidence. Simon Keenlyside brings a sense of power and complexity to Prospero, though the character is not clearly established from a musical point of view. The same could be said of the musically bloodless Miranda and Ferdinand, scrupulously though the roles are sung by Kate Royal and Toby Spence. Cyndia Sieden once again astonishes with notes that take us beyond any known soprano range, but it’s surely a flaw that important words thereby get lost. Philip Langridge is a tower of strength as the King of Naples, though Ian Bostridge’s Caliban is vocally and visually squirm-making.Librettist Meredith Oakes’ paraphrased text also creates a mixed impression. It’s clear but inevitably registers as dumbed-down Shakespeare. Tom Cairns’s production, designed by him in tandem with Moritz Junge, is a hit-and-miss affair, striking in places, at others visually undistinguished. This is certainly a major work by one of our finest composers but whether it has staying power remains to be seen.

He oozes stage professionalism as the Spanish nobleman (“celebrated, cultivated, underrated”  as Gilbert would have us believe), with a crisply lisped accent and panto-esque comic gestures. Musically, he’s a natural, too, with subtle vocal and rhythmic control.The production is set in fifties Venice, and Ashley Martin-Davis’ lollipop-coloured designs are correspondingly vivid. If only the same were true of Jonathan Lunn’s choreography, which often fails in the choruses. The first chorus of gondolieri suffers from tight, joyless movements around their chairs. The contadine also hardly exude a sense of la dolce vita.But the two central couples are finely cast, and if David Curry’s Marco and Sarah Tynan’s Gianetta slightly outdo Toby Stafford-Allen’s Giuseppe and Stephanie Marshall’s Tessa, they are all very slick performances. Rebecca Bottone’s is a Casilda of doll-like perfection and Donald Maxwell is a suitably lascivious Don Alhambra.Though considered the preserve of the amateur operatic societies up and down the land, G&S responds well (as the D’Oyly Carte company proved) to professional performances. Richard Balcombe, directing the ENO orchestra, draws precision, shading and poignancy from the score. Slightly sluggish movement aside, this is a dynamic and colourful night out.

The class conflict loses its sting but not the sexual politics. And a good director should be able to tell the basic story so that we empathise more directly with the characters and their plight. John Fulljames and his team have ideas aplenty. The action takes place on a raised, angled wooden plinth running right across the stage. This serves initially as the Count’s minimalist pad, all soft furnishings and flimsy room dividers, later, during Act IV, as a terrace, the garden evoked by subtly lit balloons. There’s a slightly overworked video image of the Countess in bridal gear which could just be her wedding video. The Count, in the first of two student casts, is Nicholas Merryweather, a massive seventies medallion man. Though the minor characters remain figures of fun with Michael Jackson-ish body moves (the ladies of the choir are bespectacled Lady Di lookalikes), the rest of the cast go for emotional realism and are the better for it. Lithuanian Milda Smalaktye makes a game, feisty Susanna. Her Figaro, Philip Spendley, improves as the show progresses but is without charisma, pigtail notwithstanding. Tania Mandzy as Cherubino, in a remarkable physical performance, tends to lose the conductor. Perhaps the most finished vocally is Sophie Angebault’s Countess, even if her vibrato is initially rather pronounced. It all makes for an imaginatively designed, enjoyable, energetically acted evening – not one in which the music-making is especially stylish. The score is decently served by the 38-strong chamber orchestra.

Butterfly’s entry, with friends and family – lots of them – prompts a five-line procession in exotic costume, from various points around the stalls – an effective spectacle. These grand gestures work well, though the house is still swamped with guests as Butterfly reveals her closest possessions to Pinkerton, robbing the couple of early intimacy. By Act II – three years after Pinkerton has returned to America – the water-garden has dried up, in line with Butterfly’s finances.So this may not be the most richly shaded Butterfly, and there’s no probing into the clash of Japanese and American cultures beyond the obviously visual, but there’s a poignant and deftly lit end of Act I as Pinkerton and Butterfly retire on their wedding night, a touching rapport between Butterfly and her maid Suzuki, and sensitive direction of the little boy, Sorrow.The vocal amplification is carefully done, and the vocal/orchestral balance only differently imperfect – hardly any worse, ultimately – than that in the opera house.The singing is good throughout, with Ai-Lan Zhu making a bright but slightly mature-sounding Butterfly and Gerard Powers’ vocally suave Pinkerton painting a man who is flawed but sincere, rather than one who is inherently spineless or egocentric. The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra play well under Peter Robinson, properly underlining the opera’s dissonances, even if the picture-postcard production – enjoyable as it is – sometimes doesn’t.

A vast wrecking ball is prominent in the busy stage picture, with several speakers’ rostra from which these disparate groups can argue their cases. Russia is clearly in turmoil, awaiting the arrival of another ‘strong man’.It’s not a bad analogy for the historic original, but the set gets in the way of movement and too many of the main portrayals are fuzzy around the edges, or even weakly sung. Rosalind Plowright’s voice is in disarray as Marfa, the sole character to move between the groups. Tom Randle’s Prince Andrei Khovansky is dramatically centred, but awkward at the vocal edges. Peter Hoare sings well, but his portrait of the westernised Prince Golitsyn is lightweight. Julian Close offers neither the vocal nor the dramatic gravitas for Dosifei, the priest who leads his Old Believer followers to fiery self-destruction at the close – a moment, incidentally, feebly realised.Both Robert Hayward’s Ivan Khovansky and Peter Sidhom’s Shaklovity provide the scale and vocal grandeur needed, but despite being sung in English, this production’s level of dramatic engagement is all too low, not helped by weak conducting from Lothar Koenigs.

So it’s apt that Francisco Negrin’s Royal Opera production, receiving its first revival, adds dancers to suggest Mars and Venus, appealing respectively to Orlando’s knightly honour and to his heart, as well as a mischievous Eros whose arrows also pierce the hearts of others. It’s a source of some frustration, though, that while the poetic movements of the open-breasted Venus and the scantily-clad Eros open up a genuine realm of expression, the cliched fighting movements of Mars sometimes descend to self-parody.Anthony Baker’s designs mix painted pastoral scenes with modern symbolism but are short on atmosphere, impact or cohesion. Amazingly, the regular stage rotations manage not to tire, unlike the constant reappearances of Kyle Ketelsen’s Zoroastro, a constant observer of the action. Here more a man of learning than mystical sage, his considerable powers of influence become highly questionable.If the production grates, the singers excel. Rosemary Joshua’s agile-voiced Angelica and Anna Bonitatibus’ eager Medoro convincingly engage in their forbidden love, while Bejun Mehta, though perhaps not fully projecting Orlando’s rage, is sensitive to his jealousy and confusion. The vocally rich and dramatically confident Kyle Ketelsen is as convincing as the director’s prosaic view of Zoroastro allows, but the highlight is Camilla Tilling’s bright-sounding, highly characterised Dorinda, creating a central role for the down-at-heel shepherdess. Combined with the period instrument Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, the musical performance is first class.

The difficulty is that the emotional lives of the protagonists can look less important than the evocation of their social milieu. Now enjoying a sixth revival and no longer performed without an interval, the show has acquired more warmth.Certain aspects grate, even so. The vast, one-level studio set still lacks intimacy and rationale. Act I seems too brightly lit, particularly when Rodolfo and Mimi are looking for her key ‘in the dark’, while Act VI finds Mimi’s bed placed in what appears to be a side alley. Act II is full of vibrant if conventional crowd movement with a game near-striptease from Giselle Allen’s Musetta.The best singing comes from Mark Stone’s mellifluous Marcello and from Matthew Rose, making an auspicious ENO debut as Colline. Mary  Plazas is back as Mimi, her waif-like presence as affecting as ever, but she conveys little of the heroine’s flirtatious side. Peter Auty’s Rodolfo is well acted but his voice has a metallic top. Under the promising Xian Zhang, the orchestra returns to something like its best form, occasionally overwhelming the singers with enthusiastic surges of tone. If the opera must be performed in English with surtitles, it is difficult to conceive of a wittier text than that provided by Jeremy Sams.This revival is dedicated to the memory of its original director, Pimlott. Nicholas Hytner took the stage to deliver a succinct and appropriate eulogy before the performance on opening night.

This is enhanced by Guy Davenport’s translation, which raises chuckles rather than belly laughs, and Donizetti’s melodies, which just skip along, thanks to arranger and conductor Tom Higgins and the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra.Alistair Digges as Nemorino has occasional lapses, where his voice can’t quite compete with the chorus or the orchestra at full pelt, but redeems himself with a perfectly judged performance of the popular second act aria, usually known as Una Furtiva Lagrima. Perhaps it is first night nerves, for Hakan Vramsmo and Dominic Barrand also have their own minor problems during the first act, with pitch and with timing respectively, but carry off the comedic aspects of their roles – Sgt Belcore’s massive ego and Dr Dulcamara’s charlatanism, with ease.Alice Woodbridge is delightful as Gianetta, and her aria where she spreads a little gossip among the ladies of the village, demonstrates the effectiveness of the Opera South chorus, with most of the female cast in an arc across the stage engaged in synchronised tea-stirring.Eliana Pretorian as Adina is simply stunning. Not only her strong but clear singing voice, but also her looks and her elegance as she moves around the stage, are perfection.Ian MacKenzie-Thurley must be congratulated for getting on to a stage the size of a postage stamp – a 40-strong chorus that, rather than descending into chaos, enhances the production, musically and dramatically.

It’s refracted, however, through the post-modern eyes of director Christopher Alden, whose take on the piece is anything but conventional. That’s fine, though in this case it’s not clear what his new version is telling us.Paul Steinberg’s single set (the work is performed without interval) places us in a contemporary context where the cast of 13 sit around, mostly in theatrical costumes  – Amy Freston’s allegorical figure of Music is a showgirl. Two of them may be the Duke of Mantua, who commissioned the work, and his Duchess. Is this a group therapy session? Is the decadence of this heavy drinking, heavy smoking crew a comment on artistic patronage? And why does Anna Stephany’s Eurydice get sticky taped to the wall? Search me, though as usual with Alden the show is carried through with a high level of commitment, if not bravado.Under Baroque specialist conductor Christopher Moulds, the score is delivered with a good approximation of period style, though a bit more momentum would be welcome. Despite his monochrome voice, Paul Nilon presents the title role with considerable eloquence, and like his colleagues, writhes and wriggles his socks off.

Almost everything about Moshe Leiser and Patrice Caurier’s 2003 staging, skilfully revived here by Stephen Barlow, is unobtrusive, minimalist, just a little safe. The progress of the narrative is mirrored in the changing landscape seen outside Butterfly’s house whenever its wall panels are winched up, not always noiselessly. Nothing else distracts.Introduced via Raymond Gubbay’s Albert Hall Butterfly in 1998 and already a veteran of the present production, the Cio-Cio-San of Chinese soprano, Liping Zhang remains astonishing. This portrayal is as affecting as any currently before the public, believable even in her death throes when she is required to flutter her kimono sleeves as if trying vainly to fly. The voice is neither over-large, nor especially beautiful, yet there isn’t a dry eye in the house. No mere cipher, Elena Cassian her Suzuki, towers over her, making more credible her attempts to protect her mistress.They are joined now – he missed the first night – by Andrew Richards, a dashing young tenor star making his Covent Garden debut but already an experienced Pinkerton. With his mellifluous Italian timbre and all-American looks, he contrives to suggest something of the character’s ambivalence. Alan Opie does sterling work as the US consul. Martyn Hill is the insinuating marriage broker. Demonstrating an acute ear for sonority and balance, conductor Nicola Luisotti favours revitalising extremes of tempo, the opening nearly rushed off its feet, parts of Act II almost too spacious.

It’s been called his first great opera, and is certainly one of the funniest.The brilliant libretto describes the machinations instigated by the unscrupulous Agrippina to ensure that her son, Nero, will succeed her husband Claudius as emperor. This is a woman who will stop at nothing, though her schemes are regularly complicated by the interventions of the lovely Poppea, whom all the men in the opera lust after.McVicar’s production, originally seen in Brussels, is staged here by McVicar himself with Lee Blakeley. Presenting this cynical tale of sex and power-politics in the power-dressing of today proves a good idea. John Macfarlane’s imposing sets are dominated by a throne at the top of some stairs and include what is presumably the world’s first harpsichord bar.But the evening feels long. It’s partly that Daniel Reuss’s conducting lacks theatrical pace, partly that the routines (including some of Andrew George’s choreography) are not as crisp as they should be but mostly because Handel’s three acts are played as two, giving us two ginormous segments of Wagnerian proportions instead of three manageable ones.That should be rectified, because the cast is strong, with Sarah Connolly’s vivid Agrippina, Brindley Sherratt’s superbly sung Claudio and Lucy Crowe’s star turn as Poppea. Amanda Holden’s witty English translation is a another plus.

Originally devised and directed by Joachim Herz from the three versions Puccini made of his masterpiece, this revival by Caroline Chaney emphasises the unsympathetic Yankee arrogance of Lieutenant Pinkerton, which has been somewhat softened over the years.As Cio-Cio-San, Amanda Roocroft is petite, fragile and vulnerable, singing with such lyrical style and heart-breaking power as to be worthy of the ecstatic decibels that greeted her after curtain fall. As Pinkerton, Paul Charles Clarke matches her vocally, all too convincing in the imposed interpretation of a brash insensitive clod who cannot even reach out to his sorely betrayed Japanese wife at the end. Owing to the indisposition of Neil Davies with a virus that left him voiceless on the day, Eddie Wade, despite having a cold, took over Sharpless most effectively. The Suzuki of Claire Bradshaw continues as one of the gems of this production. Supporting roles are satisfyingly handled by Philip Lloyd Holtam as marriage broker Goro, David Soar as the Bonze, Alastair Moore as Yamadori and Sian Meinie as Kate.Refurbished in 1998, the cherry blossom, sepia setting be Reinhart Zimmermann and the chocolate-and-white costumes of Eleonore Kleiber are simply stunning.Julian Smith, whose researches contributed much to this version of the score, conducts the on-form orchestra with a sure touch.

Think of those fifties Italian travel films, restored and revitalised. Then imagine Vespa scooters on the stage.Andrew Kennedy’s cash-strapped waiter Nemorino is in love with the seemingly uncaring hotel owner Adina. Kennedy plays Nemorino with an affectionate charm and obvious enjoyment. His singing is gentle and hints at restraint.Anna Ryberg is the capricious Adina. She does not have a strong voice but there were signs during the opera’s second performance, when this production was reviewed, that she was pacing herself and positioning herself for better effect.Providing the supposed elixir of love for the lovelorn Nemorino is Peter Savidge’s smooth-talking and smooth-moving Doctor Dulcamara. Arriving via a hot air balloon and dressed like a near relative of Willy Wonka, he gives the story its comic sharpness. Whenever Savidge opens his mouth, the words are clear and unmistakable. Elsewhere with some of the principal singers, and with the chorus, this is not always the case.The chorus does move well, both collectively and in smaller groups. Its members display some neat comic gestures. The partying ladies must have been observing the weekend goings on in city-centre Leeds for their splendid drunken antics.This Elixir of Love is played with a jolly disposition. There are some aspects that need attention but those aspects will not have escaped the director’s ear.

Third time around though, the transposition to the 19th century hardly seems to matter. Nicola Luisotti, music director designate at San Francisco Opera and a newcomer to Covent Garden, brings a potentially static evening to glorious life, keeping a tight rein on proceedings while allowing plenty of expressive freedom to his non-Italian principals.Of these, the American mezzo Stephanie Blythe, in a new role for her, is sensational as the gypsy Azucena. She emerges as a true character actor and a vocal juggernaut capable of everything from exquisite sotto voce to sepulchral chest tones. Star tenor Marcelo Alvarez is also on top form, his Manrico never less than passionate and eager, if more generalized in theatrical response. British baritone Anthony Michaels-Moore may be a little light of voice for the Count di Luna and he seems stiffly directed in the earlier scenes. The statuesque Leonora of Catherine Naglestad also strikes some curious, formulaic poses and, beginning harshly, never quite develops the tonal allure the role requires. First night nerves, perhaps. The opening narrative is compellingly performed by another American, the bass Raymond Aceto.Contrary to expectations, this is not an evening in which one applauds sets, lighting and costumes while remaining indifferent to the activity on stage. Chorus and orchestra, pressed hard at times, respond magnificently, with particularly striking work from the lower strings and winds.

The staging is mostly realistic – think Upstairs Downstairs or Gosford Park rather than 18th-century Spain – but its surrealistic touches play against the social comedy of the text. Some of these have been toned down since November though plenty of extraneous detail remains. Even before a note is played, gardeners are watering the fake flora. Act 1 takes place on two levels yet fails to elucidate the hierarchy of class. Most controversial is the idea of making Figaro a (briefly) traumatized war veteran with a memory of life in the trenches. The Countess’s boudoir for Act 2 is a terracotta art deco pad clashing hideously with the costumes. One might easily attribute her inability to keep her man to appalling dress sense.Musically the evening disappoints. The chorus is on fine form, the orchestra fallible. Andre de Ridder, so able a navigator in Gerald Barry’s The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant, here offers rigidity without crispness. Co-ordination between the singers and the pit is surprisngly poor. The stars of the show are Sarah Tynan, fresh and believably proper as Susanna and Elizabeth Watts a delightful Barbarina. Susan Gritton, once an admired Susanna, starts edgily as the Countess. Iain Paterson, previously Figaro for Glyndebourne on Tour, is perfectly acceptable, stolid and Scottish. Scott Hendricks is that singular anomaly, a Texan Count. This is Mozart decontextualized and played as G&S.

But although the theatre remained in active use until the 1950s, when the NHS took over, it suffered decades of neglect. More happily five years ago as a planning gain it was sumptuously restored by John Laing Homes at a cost of £1.4m.As Normansfield’s first professional presentation since 1909, Anthony Baker’s Carl Rosa charity revival of Patience combined classic D’Oyly Carte performing style with this richly decorative theatre setting to create an evening of rare aesthetic pleasure.In a new exploratory version of Act 1 the cast were put through their rehearsal paces, led by Timothy West as Gilbert’s stage manager, offering a sense of work in progress including material cut following the Opera Comique premiere. But after the interval Normansfield’s stock scenery plus period lighting effects, created the Act 2 forest glade setting for a full scale performance including Anne Collins reprising her legendary ENO Lady Jane complete with cello effects.Victorian glamour was supplied by Liza Pulman, Lesley Cox and Rebecca Rudge as rapturous maidens and Charlotte Page as Patience. Simon Butteriss and Bruce Graham were the scampering poets, while the evening’s outstanding vocal verve came from baritone Donald Maxwell with his Heavy Dragoons patter song. Sheer bliss.

The opera then becomes one long, heady flashback through which his demise becomes all the more inevitable.There are minor annoyances in this production. The Act One urchins, though they put on an entertaining show, completely dwarf the new guard in number and the multi-purpose ochre walls (designed by Tanya McCallin) dominate every scene, a blandness which can only partially be offset by Paule Constable’s lighting.The second cast take a while to settle in to its first night. The Act One duet for Don Jose (Marco Berti) and Micaela (Liping Zhang) suffer from intonation problems, but both singers later acquit themselves with distinction; Berti’s searing Italianate tenor only just stopping short at times of piercing you between the eyes and Zhang’s light lyricism helping to underline Micaela’s sweet vulnerability.Remarkably, the animals – a donkey and chicken in the busy Sevillian square and even the horse on which Escamillo arrives at Lillas Pastias’ tavern – are naturally woven into the scenes, though Escamillo seems awkwardly glued atop his steed for too much of his Toreador Song. This Escamillo though, sung by Laurent Naouri, is the voice of the evening, cavernous but ringing with excitement. His dark looks and suave manner do not go amiss either. Victoria Vizin’s Carmen is finely sung and sexually confident but lacking in true hot-headedness.Conducted by Philippe Auguin, the playing is often underheated too. The score’s vivid colours are dulled and precision is weak. This said, with more excitement in the pit and perhaps a little less ochre on stage, this could still be a winning production.

Yukia Ellias’ choreography creates sweeping group scenes and some vivacious individual movement.Humour abounds. In the translator Carole Ann Duffy’s vigorous couplets, in the delicious singing of Roderick Williams as the bird hunter Papageno and in the soldiers’ hilarious reactions to the sound of Papageno’s magic bells.The teasing, mischievous, hugely enjoyably playing of the Three Women servants of the Queen of The Night makes one wonder why Mozart’s collaborator Schikaneder, did not give them more exciting names.Jean Kalman’s set design reflects the gaiety and glee. Huge mountains are suddenly unfurled from high above. Papageno’s tree, looking as if it is constructed from a wrecked packing case, becomes an inventive delight when tiny birds appear on its branches.Making their Opera North debuts are Ed Lyon and Norika Urata as the lovers Tamino and Pamina. He is costumed as if for a globe trotting gap year. His singing is consistent but his acting is hesitant. She is bubbly and crystal clear.Chester Patton makes an imposing and rather chilling Sarastro and Penelope Randall- Davies, as the Queen of the Night, is quite terrifying. Who do we root for in their power struggle?Rather than accept an already muddled plot Tim Supple tries for dramatic clarity but only succeeds in serving up something that is even more muddled. Still, there are always the fun moments and of course the music.

Last time round it starred Joan Sutherland in the title role, with Luciano Pavarotti knocking out top C after top C to her side. This time it’s an equivalently starry pairing, with the leading coloratura of the day, French soprano Natalie Dessay, enjoying her tomboy role as Marie, a young woman brought up by an entire regiment of soldiers, and Peruvian tenor Juan Diego Florez effortlessly graceful and equally virtuosic as her adored Tonio.The bigger picture is secure in Laurent Pelly’s production, though Chantal Thomas’ sets are not the most inspiring and the comedy arguably too broad, with an excess of mugging. Bruno Campanella’s conducting too has some wayward moments, with some unconvincing changes of pace and insufficient precision. But as a whole the evening has enough feelgood factor about it to win through.Adding to its quality are Felicity Palmer’s strong-minded but neurotic Marquise de Berkenfield, ably abetted by Donald Maxwell’s daffy Hortensius and Alessandro Corbelli’s sympathetic Sergeant Sulpice. Dawn French makes her operatic debut in the non-singing role of the hyper-snobbish Duchess of Crackentorp, and fully justifies the beefing-up of the part with a finely tuned performance that ups the comic ante.But overall it’s the outstanding singing of the two stars, who supply moments of languid pathos amid their flamboyant vocalism, which makes this a memorable evening.

It’s her job to break the spell that has condemned him to be a farmyard animal.Whereas plenty of seasonal shows talk down to their audiences, this is a show that dares to sing up to them. And it does so in the most spellbindingly original new score heard on the London theatrical stage this year – when most new musicals nowadays are recycling of pop jukeboxes, here’s music of genuine theatrical power, allied to a libretto of wit and narrative drive, that is punchily performed by a sensational cast of brilliant singers.

Meanwhile the constabulary, with baritone Ben Crow at their head, become security guards although still lamenting that “a policeman’s lot is not a happy one”.Light tenor Stephen Carlile is ideal casting as the apprentice pirate Frederic, while Alan McMahon delivers a word-perfect, wickedly updated patter song as the modern Major General.Only diehard Savoyards would complain. But I do regret that Gilbert’s best joke, revealing the pirates as hereditary peers “gone wrong” while fiercely loyal to the Queen, is here reduced to being a troupe of unemployed Equity members swearing allegiance to Shakespeare.

Anna Caterina Antonacci seems equally at home here in the mezzo register as she is singing as a nominal soprano; her gypsy girl is sexy, determined and packed with personality. She is well matched by the Don Jose of German tenor Jonas Kaufmann, whose voice may lack a heroic ring but who paces himself beautifully. His character study is complex and rewarding, and his Flower Song a highlight.Italian baritone Ildebrando D’Arcangelo cuts a striking figure as Escamillo, his macho manner balanced by some vital charm. Norah Amsellem’s gauche Micaela offers the perfect foil to Antonacci’s raunchier femme fatale. Every one of the smaller roles is vividly presented, with Jacques Imbrailo’s Morales and Matthew Rose’s Zuniga particularly strong.Tanya McCallin’s adaptable unit set conjures up a heat-and-light-filled Spain and its ease of movement helps ensure a pacey evening. There is plenty of activity from the chorus, the kids, and even a few animals, keeping the eye busy throughout, but Zambello never goes over the top, focusing brilliantly on essentials where needed. The result, executed with panache by the entire company, is a nigh-on perfect realisation of Bizet’s masterpiece that should stand the Royal Opera in good stead for many years.

It is a striking work, not only for the emotional realism of its characters, but also for its moral stance, which celebrates the triumph of evil over good.Paul Curran’s production for the RCM plays on the inherent immediacy with markedly brave scenes of sensual intimacy. As the curtain rises after the Prologue the adulterous Nero and Poppea are naked in bed, while the Page’s flirtations in Act 2 with lady-in-waiting Damigella make it clear he is after more than a bit of slap and tickle. More eye-openingly, Nero’s sensual duet with Lucan extolling Poppea’s charms takes on a homoerotic note of shared ecstasy.The comic inflections are well played too, among them the Philip Shakesby’s eager, form-filling Mercury, Eliana Pretorian’s aforementioned Page and tenor Alistair Digge’s Arnalta (who also sings an affecting lullaby to Poppea).The singing is good if not stunning. Huw Llywleyn sometimes struggles at the top in a demanding role; Pumeza Matshikiza is a vibrant Poppea, though she could appear more scheming. Kostas Smoriginas shows the promise of a distinctive, ringing bass but seemed slightly under-engaged and Ida Falk Winland stands out, vocally and dramatically, in the smaller role of Damigella. Michael Rosewell directs the very able players in a fine production that while provocative, doesn’t suffer from directorial hijacking.

The woman responsible for bringing this company to Britain 11 years ago, adds a lightness of touch to this frothy concoction.Sung in English, the vocal translation is by Ruth and Thomas Martin whilst the spoken dialogue, by Olga Gusan has been adapted by Kent with the addition of an amusing shaggy dog story as well as some topical and local references. Whilst this brought laughter when Lady Thatcher was toasted there was an audible gasp when Putin’s name was mentioned.However the sets and costumes magnificently evoke 19th-century Vienna and the cast, who cope extremely well with the language, appeared to be thoroughly enjoying the experience of singing operetta.Irina Vinogradova is a beautiful and assured Rosalinde who handles the difficult arias well and she is ably partnered by Ruslan Anzinevych as her philandering husband Gabriel, who is also in fine voice.Maria Tsonina is perfectly at ease in the role of the cheeky chambermaid, Adele and delights with her show pieces whilst Zarui Vardanean makes a mark as the hard-drinking Prince Orlovsky.Anatol Arcea has fun as the manipulating Falke who takes pleasure in wreaking his revenge and Mihai Timofti is a funny Frosch.The orchestra, like the cast, played with energy under the baton of conductor Nicolae Dohotaru making this a delightfully entertaining evening as light as any champagne bubble.

Although we’ve seen a previous production, by The Chisnau National Opera, the set may look familiar but is minus the orange blossom and koi carp – although there’s still the sound of a gurgling water feature.The strength of this company lies vocally with the chorus in good voice. Maria Tsonina makes her debut singing Cio Cio San and whilst it’s a delight to see someone so young and pretty sing the role of the 15-year-old geisha, the orchestra appeared to drown her first entrance. This may be simply a matter of nerves because, as the evening progressed, she grew vocally and dramatically in stature. However, whilst she flitted quite beautifully around the stage, like the butterfly she’s named after, there was a marked lack of physical passion between her and Pinkerton.Ruslan Zinevych was in fine voice as the American sailor who betrays Butterfly’s love and his good looks and easy manner made her feelings for him understandable. Vladimir Dragos sang the rather pompous Sharpless whist Zarui Vardanean both sang and acted well as the loyal Suzuki.Sung in Italian with English surtitles.

Specialist conductor Laurence Cummings imbues the playing of the Royal Academy’s Period Instrument Baroque Orchestra with the requisite style and their achievement is one of the best points of the evening. But much of the singing, too, shows an acquaintance with Baroque practice that does credit to all concerned.Staging works, however, written for the lavishly subsidised forces of the Paris Opera in the mid-eighteenth century really needs a bigger budget than is available on this occasion. Too many of designer Emma Cattell’s sometimes eccentric costumes have an all-purpose ancient-world look that once or twice suggests the school nativity play, while the blood regularly spurting from wounds recalls Monty Python and the Holy Grail.Director Robert Chevara extracts performances from his cast of variable quality. But several of them impress, especially from a vocal point of view. In the title role of Jupiter’s son Dardanus, Allan Clayton reveals a tenor voice of strength and breadth that should take him far. In the three varied soprano roles, Claire Watkins as Venus, Louise Deans as Cupid and Julia Sporsen as Iphise all make their mark.The remaining men are more mixed, though some quality singing was heard from George von Bergen’s Teucer. A hugely ambitious evening and at least a partial success.

One of Sullivan’s most melodious scores, it provides opportunities for a large cast of fine singers, and this one has no weak links – indeed, one can scarcely imagine the piece better sung.But it also needs strong comic acting performances and it has those too. Geoffrey Dolton is impeccable as the Duke of Plaza-Toro, with Ann Murray superbly grand as the Duchess. Their haughty daughter Casilda is wonderfully recreated by Rebecca Bottone, while Donald Maxwell’s comic villain of a Grand Inquisitor is masterly. Strong, too, are the two main couples, with Sarah Tynan’s Gianetta, Stephanie Marshall’s Tessa, David Curry’s Marco and Toby Stafford-Allen’s Giuseppe all giving full value. There is a small gem of a performance from Deborah Davison as the aged crone Inez, who makes the final scene irresistibly funny. Most of all there is a sense of the cast enjoying themselves, which is vital in operetta. Ashley Martin-Davis’s designs present a fifties Venice in the first act, with particularly stylish costumes for the female chorus and the Plaza-Toro family. Jonathan Lunn’s choreography looks a little busy in places, but it is finely executed. Conductor Richard Balcombe sends the score tripping gaily over the footlights, with the second act a constant succession of hit numbers.Martin Duncan’s staging gets the tone of the piece absolutely right. This is surely ENO’s best operetta since the Jonathan Miller Mikado.

Hattie Naylor’s libretto cleverly mixes ancient and modern verse, interweaving the classical story with knitting patterns, which sounds bizarre but strangely doesn’t seem out of place.Daniel Broad, with his rich baritone and good looks, is every inch the classical hero – but this Odysseus is only seen through the eyes of his women. Is he a hero or a war criminal?Excellent performances from Phyllis Cannan as Hecuba, Sadhbh Dennedy as Nausica and Monica Brett-Crowther as Circe include a sex scene reminiscent of Basic Instinct.Director Bill Bankes-Jones left the house lights up during the first act so the audience could read the poetry but eventually they were dimmed while the musicians intermingled with the cast.This accessible production is to be applauded for combining an impressive array of talent in an original format which was enormously entertaining.

The great role is that of Bajazet, who eventually takes the poison intended by his daughter Asteria for Tamerlane and dies after a no-holds-barred scene that is one of Handel’s most moving. Tenor Tom Randle seizes the dramatic initiative here and throughout a performance that from most points of view is a severe disappointment.It has, however, some musical compensations. Gail Pearson sings charmingly as Asteria, while mezzo Jennifer Johnston makes her mark with a vividly delivered account of Tamerlane’s betrothed, Irene, though why director John La Bouchardiere’s production has her relegated to comic status as a maid is anyone’s guess.Gideon Davey’s set, inspired by the ravaging of Baghdad’s museum in the Iraq war, is a finely achieved piece of work but doesn’t fit the opera Handel wrote. Throughout, characterisation and in some cases basic stagecraft are at a premium, making the evening slow and dramatically incoherent. You would never guess that Tamerlano was one of the composer’s greatest operas.Scottish Opera’s orchestra played with spirit on the second night, under the baton of James Grossmith, stepping in for an indisposed Christian Curnyn.

Larissa Diadkova excels in the small but key role of the aged Countess – her old crone can actually sing. Vladimir Galouzine is back as a vivid if oddly-costumed Gherman – he’s meant to be an army officer – commanding the stage with his sensational heavy tenor. Occidental interloper, Gerald Finley is on peak form, a suave Yeletsky. Vassily Gerello offers us a game, experienced Tomsky. Mlada Khudoley makes a successful house debut as Liza, believable as the Countess’ ward, unusual in looking and sounding her character’s age. Semyon Bychkov gets idiomatic and refined results from the orchestra.Visually though, the evening is messy. Peter J Davison’s much-criticized single set design, intended to project key tropes from what is after all a surrealistic tale, has lost its defining central bank of unmelting snow. Defying the march of the seasons, this now appears only in the show’s second half. There remains the general suggestion of a ruined palace, some attractive props and costumes and a stack of theatrical loges stage right to point up the artificiality of it all. It isn’t clear that the heroine commits suicide and we’ve little sense of context for the final card game.

Derived from the 16th-century epic poem Orlando furioso by Ludovico Ariosto, Handel’s Orlando concerns the eponymous knight who, torn between love and glory, elects to pursue affairs of the heart over his duty as a warrior. With the help of a potion administered by the magician Zoroastro, he is brought back from the brink of insanity – to an enlightened state in which he accepts Angelica’s love for his rival Medoro.For this scenario replete with references to the stars and planets, director and set designer Alessandro Tallevi appropriately places the action on a circular stage which surrounds a central pit for the musicians. Beguiling mechanical props and projected shadow-puppet animations are magically, sensitively brought into play, as are two dancers.Counter-tenor William Towers begins as a suitably distracted Orlando, his voice ringing with an attractive feminine shine, but his rival Medoro’s counter-tenor – and physique – is gutsier and this comparatively lessens the impact of Towers’ mad scene. If Nicholas Warden’s Zoroastro was less distinguished, it gained on first night in vocal and physical assurance. The two female singers complete the generally accomplished cast – Joana Seara’s bright, vibrant soprano is well suited to the shepherdess Dorinda while Rebecca Ryan makes a fruity, intelligently sung Angelica.The high standards of singing and direction are let down by Gary Cooper’s relatively lacklustre direction from the keyboard but nevertheless, with tickets at £16, this is one of London’ss rare operatic bargains.

Phyllida Lloyd’s production, with simple but dour designs by Anthony Ward, offers an unflattering portrait of the inhabitants of an English village, with prying eyes and hypocritical judgement turning Grimes into a hate figure and then sending him to his death. Though the original is set around 1830, the costumes bring us near to our day but there’s no less in focus and a big gain in immediacy.The chorus excels itself both vocally and dramatically, and many Opera North regulars deliver clear-edged portrayals of the smaller roles. Yvonne Howard is the half-maternal, half-cynical Auntie, landlady of the local pub, in charge of her two tarty ‘nieces’, sung by Amy Freston and Claire Booth – as credible a duo as could be. Managing a well-judged degree of charm, Roderick Williams is memorable as Ned Keene, here dealing drugs on the quiet. Brilliantly played too are Nigel Robson’s rector, Stephen Richardson’s Hobson, Richard Angas’ Swallow and Ethna Robinson’s Mrs Sedley, while Alan Oke’s half-crazed evangelist Bob Boles is outstanding.Right at the centre are Christopher Purves’s no-nonsense Balstrode, Giselle Allen’s unusually involving Ellen Orford and Jeffrey Lloyd-Robert’s Grimes, which stretches him vocally but he rises valiantly to the challenge. His characterisation is so disturbing as to move every spectator to the core.From the pit, conductor Richard Farnes and the orchestra tear into Britten’s score with virtuosity.

The result is a bit like Figaro Goes to Gosford Park, though the Countess’ boudoir is a very up-to-the-minute affair and the final garden scene is a menacing forest – more Hansel and Gretel than Figaro. But the narrative is well charted, even if one or two pieces of stagecraft are poorly managed. Though constantly referred to as a chair in Jeremy Sams’ skilful translation, the piece of furniture around which both Cherubino and the Count hide in the first act is clearly a bed and the window out of which Cherubino leaps in Act 2 has to be lowered specially from the flies. And while the characterisations and action of this most precise and detailed of operatic comedies are all moving along the right lines, there’s a feeling that there’s still some way to go before they’re spot on.Some valid interpretations nevertheless, especially from Mark Stone’s crisply sung and energetically acted Count, from Jonathan Lemalu’s entirely likeable Figaro and from Diana Montague’s scatterbrained Marcellina. Victoria Simmonds’ Cherubino is appealingly sung but remains resolutely girlie. Also attractively vocalised are Lisa Milne’s Countess and Marie Arnet’s Susanna, though they both need more definition.So does Roland Boer’s conducting, which while capable, lacks momentum and sparkle.

Its tiny scale – just three characters, one of them silent – makes it ideal for small companies.It’s neat and clever comedy. Harry Fehr’s staging, with a lavish modern set by Becs Andrews, overlays the simplicity of the original wherein the servant Serpina connives to persuade her elderly master Umberto to marry her. To this archetypal scenario is added an over-complex scenario of dressing-up hinting at the fantasies of a middle-aged client with his female escort – the nurse’s uniform, the schoolboy and so on.But it’s not very clear and even less so why the role of the silent second servant Vespone is demoted to that of a clothes stand with a bell-hop’s uniform for the first half of the piece, particularly as actor Aaron Romano does so well with what is left.As it is, Royal Opera regular Jeremy White makes a lively Umberto while Ana James might have got further with Serpina had the production allowed her to create a character. She sings it ably enough.Decent orchestral support from members of the Southbank Sinfonia, though Andrew Griffiths’s conducting needs more definition and attack.

Conrad Susa’s small-scale ensemble piece is based on poems by Anne Sexton, who explored in them some of the familiar fairy-tales of the Brothers Grimm while bringing to them modern – and sometimes highly disturbing – psychological perceptions.Thus amidst the familiarity of Hansel and Gretel, Rumpelstiltskin, Rapunzel, Briar Rose and the rest we enter into territories only hinted at in the originals – mental instability, marital boredom and a wide variety of sexual activity, not stopping short of incest.The result somehow retains the aptness of its designation as an entertainment whilst moving onto deeper levels.Sexton’s texts are set clearly by Susa, who adds to them layers of sophisticated irony by the employment of American popular music styles of the 1940s and 1950s. It is a clever, intriguing and thought-provoking piece, to which a talented group of eight singers bring a variety of skills in Michael Barker-Caven’s pacey production, given some tricksy allure by Joe Vanek’s designs blending standard fairy-tale imagery within a period American suburban context.Everyone shines, though Fiona McAndrew has the plum part of Sexton herself, doubling as the Witch. Wexford’s artistic director David Agler conducts and could do with a bit more energy, while the score proves more memorable in its second act than the first. But overall it is a fascinating evening.

Don Gregorio is the 1826 Neapolitan revision of the 1824 comedy L’ajo nell’imbarrazzo, which Wexford itself essayed back in 1973. The story centres on the tutor to two young men whose father Don Giulio wishes to preserve them from the sins of the world and more especially the temptations of women. The result is that the younger of the two, Pippetto, attractively sung by Vicenc Esteve, becomes obsessed by the family’s elderly maid – given plenty of spirit by Sabina Willeit – while his brother has gone off and married Gilda in secret, a role vividly delivered by Elizaveta Martirosyan. The very visible child she has borne him adds to the poignancy as well as the comedy of the situation.Indeed the wit and charm of the piece are very ably presented in Roberto Recchia’s lively production and Ferdia Murphy’s 1920s designs, while Donizetti’s top-class score is expertly revealed under the baton of Michele Mariotti. The second act is nothing short of hilarious.At the centre of proceedings is the immaculately judged Don Gregorio of Paolo Bordogna, very much a star account of the embarrassed tutor of Donizetti’s original title. An evening of delight and another worthwhile Wexford rediscovery.

Understandable first-night nerves on the part of Anna Leese, taking over the role of Musetta at short notice, hinder her freedom during the Caf? Momus scene, though she is more than present and correct. Yet the show’s comic style and even the physical appearance of Julia Trevelyan Oman’s sets are both looking their age.Nor does the quartet of Bohemians quite gel as a credible group of flat-sharers on this occasion, though Alexander Vinogradov seizes his big chance and delivers a distinguished Coat Song in the final act. William Dazeley’s very English-sounding Marcello is too introverted to suggest Musetta’s volatile on/off lover, while Katie Van Kooten’s cool Mimi does not manage to make her character’s fragility into a central concern of the audience. We are not moved by her death, except, ironically, inasmuch as it affects Marcelo Alvarez’s Rodolfo.The Argentinean tenor, always a favourite at Covent Garden, not only sings the role with a rich and vibrant set of Latin colours and impeccable style, but physically hurls himself at it, as if he is aware that an injection of energy is badly needed. Sometimes it feels as if he is working in a vacuum.Very acceptable conducting from Philippe Jordan, though it is time the Royal Opera gave serious thought to a new La Boheme.

The period costumes are immaculately realised and Paul Brown’s remarkably adaptable set is a triumph of stagecraft, switching from railway carriage to country house interiors and exteriors with faultless timing and presentation.Every performance is beautifully delivered dramatically, though Daniel Norman, as Peter Quint and the Prologue, could do with more vocal colour and dynamic variety.Kate Royal offers a complex vision of the troubled Governess, whose own mental state seems to be fragmenting as we watch. Not all of her words are clear, but she is absolutely surefooted in her subtly judged creation of a young woman at the end of her tether.Anne-Marie Owens inhabits the role of the housekeeper Mrs Grose perfectly, and each appearance of Rachel Cobb’s bedraggled lost soul of a Miss Jessel ups the disturbing quality of the evening.Hard to imagine better performances of the two children than those offered by Christopher Sladdin’s mellifluous, enigmatic Miles or Joanna Songi’s awkward, resentful Flora.The whole adds up to a staging of Britten’s darkest opera that builds steadily to the mesmerising final scene. Not to be missed.

So the Royal Opera commissioned her to expand it into a full-length piece, and here is the result.Composed to a libretto by Paul Bentley based on a collection of Caribbean folk tales, Bird of Night is set in Trinidad (where Le Gendre was born) in the 1950s. It centres on the 15-year-old Appolline, who grows up in an environment where she is torn between the aspirations of her godmother for her to be educated and make good in Europe and a wider environment where magic – often of a sinister sort – is an everyday event. Her own dream is to become one of those enchanted beings who can fly; a bird of night.Betsabee Haas sings convincingly the young girl at the centre of attention for older members of a community whose real characters and motives she does not understand, while those singers playing her protectors and predators are all accomplished.Le Gendre’s fluent and attractive score – given character by local musical influences – is an able piece of work, though it could profitably be cut. Equally colourful are Irina Brown’s lively staging, Rae Smith’s evocative designs and Cathy Marston’s choreography. Yuval Zorn conducts with alacrity an appealing piece that makes a very positive impression.

But much of the score is striking, even though ETO’s production cuts a good deal of it, which does not make the action any clearer.The main characters – Tolomeo and his wife Seleuce – both end up disguised and unknown to one another on the island of Cyprus,after he has been thrown out of Egypt by his regal mother. His brother Alessandro joins them there and after many complications, the three are reconciled.James Conway’s production, with Michael Vale’s dour unit set consisting largely of a broken pier backed by a wooden box, may stress the troubled nature of the action but is not much to look at for an entire evening. The characters rarely seem focused on who they are and what their arias mean. The piece is sung in Italian, accurately, though with little conviction.Two singers make some individual headway, Andrew Slater with his vigorous bully of a local tyrant, Araspe, and Katherine Manley, engaged and eloquent as Seleuce. Jonathan Peter Kenny, singing with a cold, nevertheless delivers a creditable performance. The rest is so-so.Once again, the best element in the evening is the band, which supplies clear and stylish playing under Handel specialist Laurence Cummings. It’s the lacklustre visuals and direction that let the show down.

This first revival, under Samantha Potter, proves how revealing this ‘back-to-basics’ approach can be. By not having to over-egg the maid Despina’s re-appearances as doctor and notary, or the two soldiers’ return in Albanian guise, the central tenet remains focused on the questionable act of the set-up (instigated by Don Alfonso, in which the soldiers go out to test the fidelity of their fiancees) and the flood of emotion that results. Which isn’t to say that Andrew Kennedy’s lyrical ringing Ferrando and Rodion Pogossov’s richer, focused Guglielmo don’t play for laughs: it’s just that their buffoonery is contained within credible limits. The dynamic between the fiancees Fiordiligi (Aga Mikolaj) and Dorabella (Jenny Carlstedt) is as natural as their individual emotional trajectories are revealing. Henry Waddington’s younger-than-usual Don Alfonso lacks nothing in gravitas or vocal colour, while Claire Ormshaw’s Despina sings with light clarity.More revealing still is Gerard Korsten’s conducting of the Glyndebourne on Tour band. His unflashy, truth-seeking mission closely reflects the aims of the production, revealing a high level of textural detail and musical-emotional characterisation. No single phrase is simply allowed to slip by, yet the overall effect remains visceral. You could sit through this production with your eyes closed and still leave the theatre chuffed to bits. As it happens, the stage and pit are so seamlessly matched you really won’t need to do that.

It turns out to be his daughter.Written for church performance, Jephte wasn’t designed for the stage, but it works surprisingly well in Bernadette Iglich’s modern dress production, which keeps things simple. David Stout provides a strong portrayal of the proud warrior whose thoughtless vow leads to disaster, with Jane Harrington exceptionally touching as his daughter, while the remainder of the company deliver some refined ensemble singing.Dido works even better. Here Michael Vale’s designs mix periods somewhat and the cast switch effortlessly from loyal courtiers to malevolent witches to sailors. It’s crisply done and the narrative is well told in Helen Eastman’s clear-sighted production, which also creates credible characters. Outstanding among a strong cast are David Stout’s firm and grave Aeneas and Joanna Thome’s intensely human Dido, who rises to expressive heights in the famous lament. She’s well supported by Jane Harrington’s eager Belinda. This unusual pairing of works, in fact, provides the hit of the season.Once again ETO’s Baroque Orchestra gives an excellent account of itself, supplying distinctive period colours and skilled musicianship, here under the direction of Matthew Halls.

And as Mulloy is proud to point out, his touring show is both ‘un-miked and unfunded.’Those thirsty for Englishness will respond to the way mere mention of Queen Victoria brings a pack of pirates to their knees. They are rescued from ignominy when it is revealed they are peers of the realm.The costumes for Mulloy’s first Carl Rosa revival were lost in a fire last Christmas but he has taken the opportunity to redesign and rethink his whole production. The overall style is late Victorian, especially the atmospheric ruined chapel of the second act, a mysterious space lit by moonlight and flaming cauldrons. But the pirates, like those in recent movies, firmly belong to the 18th century, powerfully led by baritone Steven Page.Tenor David Curry gives Frederic an almost Cameronian niceness, just made for Jacqueline Tate’s enchanting Mabel. Meanwhile, a starry Rosemary Ashe as the rejected Ruth has the benefit of a glove puppet show to illustrate her scene-setting song about his early education. But even before that, behind a gauze drop, we are introduced to Barry Clark’s Major-General taking a comic postcard sea-bathe during the overture.My own special delight was the troupe of Cornish constables, with a spirited Tarantara! and notably Bruce Graham’s Sergeant in a definitive rendering of A Policeman’s Lot is Not a Happy One, combining open-throated delivery with well-timed comedy, plus a perfect Cornish accent – although this outstanding bass-baritone hails from Scotland.

The Eisensteins’ dressing gowns are designed, we are told, by Gustav Klimt himself, and, away from the flowing champagne and the dizzying waltzes, are references to the new science of Freud’s psychoanalysis.The rotating stage – which follows the company on tour – allows for subtle, nearly choreographed repositioning but it turns through many revolutions. Is this a giant metaphor for the waltz itself, a defining symbol of Viennese society or does it represent the bourgeois guests’ impression that the world revolves around them? More likely it is the simple overuse of an exciting theatrical toy?Bonnaventura Bottone returns as the utterly unselfconscious Alfred, with Rosalinde fruitily sung by Majella Cullagh. Amelia Farrugia makes a vocally agile and suitably stratospheric Adele, her dialogue peppered with a cockney twang, although her Act II ball dress hardly betrays her status as a housemaid and her Act III disrobing for Frank the prison governor – an attempt to demonstrate her theatrical skills – is muddled by an awkward sense of embarrassment. Allison Cook is engaging as the continuously under-entertained Orlofsky, while Richard Van Allan’s jailer Frosch has his jaded, healthily cynical spiel laced with anti-Freudian invective, including his diagnosis of the psychoanalyst’s ‘genius envy’. The highlight of the cast, though, is John Graham-Hall’s vocally blooming yet never-too-hammy Eisenstein.In the hands of Robin Ticciati the score trips along with a proper mix of sparkle, sexiness and sentiment.

Even without the last minute indisposition of their leading man on press night, not to mention some mysterious subterranean noises off, Simon Boccanegra seemed a curious choice for a fledgling company. What hope for the target audience of Classic FM aficionados when a connoisseur like Johannes Brahms despaired of its convoluted plot? With text, orchestra and chorus radically pruned, the raison d’etre of the enterprise risks evaporating too.Director Tim Heath eschews 14th-century Genoa to draw parallels with the 19th-century process of Italian unification. Or so we are told in the generous, user-friendly programme book. In fact the prologue is staged in rudimentary fashion, all black curtains, hooded figures and candles. Act I opens on an ultra-conventional terrace, decently lit. Meanwhile the band struggles. The delicate tracery of Act I Scene I quite defeats the players.The singing is variable to say the least. In the title role, James Hancock copes well enough in the circumstances. As aristocratic Fiesco, Ronald Nairne shows promise, notwithstanding a rapid, somewhat bleating vibrato. Dominic Barrand is the one team member with a consistent vocal technique though he conveys little of Paolo’s evil intent. Scheherazade Pesante, wildly miscast as Amelia, screams her way through the high tessitura. Gediminas Varna’s Gabriele is big and ardent but his untamed tenor requires a lot more work. The same might be said for John Mullis’s plucky operatic venture. The opera is sung in an approximation of the original Italian with English surtitles.

Director Jane McCulloch has provided a new English version, which doesn’t depart radically from the original and doesn’t have quite enough wit but is perfectly presentable.So are the show’s visuals, which move the action forward to 1934 in Cleo Pettitt’s economical but adequate sets and Michael O’Connor’s attractive costumes. The choreography by Donna Berlin is apt and neatly done and the direction of the show has some pace, if not quite enough poise.No star voices here but a more than respectable standard of singing, though Pamela Hay’s Hanna Glawari is woefully short of consonants and Jim Heath’s Camille needs to attend to his vowel sounds. Though John Lofthouse’s Danilo is no great shakes vocally either, he knows how to put over his dialogue as well as his songs and, given an injection of man-of-the-world sophistication to add to his native charm, could be a fine exponent of the role. Thomasin Trezise’s Valencienne, too, has some flair on offer.Best of the principals are the Baron Zeta of Martin Lamb and the experienced Njegus of Gregory Cox, who both know exactly how to deliver their material and do so with spirit.

But the main auditorium is seemingly unchanged, though in fact it has been extensively heightened and there is a new wrap-around aisle behind the seating blocks.They have boldly returned with a reprise for the first work that they went on ‘walkabout’ with during the theatre’s two-year closure – the community opera Tobias and the Angel. Co-written by the Young Vic’s artistic director David Lan with composer Jonathan Dove, it was originally commissioned for a Birmingham church but first professionally produced by Almeida Opera in 1999.Though it may not therefore be new, it inaugurates the space in an epic way that pushes it to its full potential and draws over 140 performers from Lambeth and Southwark to join a professional cast of 12 singers to perform it. As some of them pour through the auditorium and inhabit the upper reaches of the new second gallery, the show becomes an astounding achievement in every way, not just for its immense scale but also the wonderful way it harnesses the theatre’s astonishing capacity for the intimate as well as the massive.Dove’s hauntingly beautiful score is thrillingly sung by these huge forces under David Charles Abell’s expert baton, with counter-tenor James Laing in particularly stirring voice as the stranger – the angel Raphael – who accompanies Tobias on his journey to retrieve a debt of his father’s and comes back with both a wife and a cure for his father’s blindness.

Charles Edwards’ sets and Jon Morrell’s costumes bring the action forward from the late nineteenth century to recent times, when the elements of folk culture and the domination of religion in moral thinking would have diminished but the work’s punch is retained in David Alden’s gripping staging, which relies on a particularly fine deployment of the ENO chorus.At the show’s heart are Amanda Roocroft’s Jenufa and Catherine Malfitano as her foster-mother, the Kostelnicka, who murders Jenufa’s illegitimate baby out of misplaced love and pride. Malfitano maintains her dominance both vocally and dramatically but Roocroft goes further, seeking out the emotional truth of her character with the deepest attention to detail. This is an exceptional performance even by her exacting standards.The two crucial tenor roles both lack an ideal vocal power, though Paul Charles Clarke conveys well the fecklessness of Steva, who gets Jenufa into trouble, and Stuart Skelton some of the complexity of his half-brother Laca, whose love finally gets her out of it.The smaller roles are well cared for, with Susan Gorton once again creating a credible presentation of Grandmother Buryja. Mikhail Agrest conducts with a good sense of pace, though some of the edginess of Janacek’s sound-world is smoothed away. But his great opera moves the audience in what is a definite success for ENO.

Instead, the court becomes a drab office with plastic blinds, while Rigoletto and Sparafucile apparently live in a trailer park enclosed within high metal-mesh fencing topped by barbed wire. So much for Renaissance Italy. Where are we? And who are these people? The Duke is just a testy sleazeball. Sparafucile, sporting a Mohican, comes on like a psychotic. His sister Maddalena becomes Gilda’s venal guardian – is Sparafucile pimping for the Duke? Rigoletto’s status is unfathomable; he could be a caretaker.Edward’s updated staging creates no credible social order so that characters lack definition and Monterone’s curse is rendered ludicrous. Stagecraft is amateur. Would an escaping seducer leave behind his telltale coat? Well, Edwards wants Gilda to fondle it lovingly during ‘Caro nome’. Half-baked ideas unsupported by either score or libretto scupper motivation.Thank God for the musical pleasures. Alan Opie, despite throat trouble, sings a superb, three-dimensional Rigoletto, albeit stranded in a theatrical vacuum, though his every exchange with Henriette Bonde-Hansen’s mettlesome, pure-toned Gilda generates genuine drama.Rafael Rojas’ sleazy Duke, rather too mature to pass for a student, rarely sings below forte but can spin a long-breathed line. Martin Andre conducts a texturally clear, rather lightweight reading lacking a coherent overview. Chorus and orchestra respond like thoroughbreds.

Written in 1655, this example of Venetian opera in the post-Monteverdi era was one of the best known of the 17th-century and even acquired an English translation in the 1670s, though no definite UK staging at that time has been established. It is an adaptation of this ancient translation that ETO uses and it still works well.Though the plot is ultra-complex, Cavalli’s score is rich in melody. Rodney Grant’s designs conjure a simple but attractive vision of a Middle Eastern palace, in which the production – here staged by Joseph Alford, but originally the work of James Conway, for Ireland’s Opera Theatre Company – make some sense of the narrative, aided by some dramatically effective and vocally adept performances.The title role is that of the long lost daughter of the tyrannical king of ancient Media, Erimante (Andrew Slater, on authoritative form). Rachel Nicholls achieves a well-rounded portrayal of Erismena, disguised for the purposes of the plot as a warrior, while Jonathan Peter Kenney is nicely ambiguous as Erimante’s cup-bearer, Idraspe. Laura Mitchell excels as the slave Aldimira, with Patricia Orr firmly in the picture as Prince Orimeno and there are a couple of strong comic servants from David Stout and Huw Rhys-Evans (the latter in drag).Leading the musical performance is conductor Brian Gordon, who draws convincing sounds from the aptly scaled period-instrument orchestra.

For once, it turns out, the ambient on-stage ambling before the opening makes some sense for the characters here are a bunch of strangers, deserted on a barren landscape, who somehow decide to act out Orpheus’ story. If it all sounds a bit like the cast of Lost spontaneously performing The Sound of Music, it’s a whole lot more atmospheric, though there is little scope for attaching identity to the real-life characters.At the opera’s end, after Apollo invites the unsuccessful Orpheus to leave the earthly world, the hero’s real-life partners, bizarrely, are ready to deliver him to the next world by stoning.Kathy Prendergast’s simple but austere design – inhospitable craggy trees, a pile of rocks – create an inventively unreal atmosphere. The production’s strongest element though, is the ETO Baroque Orchestra under Robert Howarth, lending a welcome period-performance touch. More the pity that the singers are not always cast accordingly. Katherine Manley as Music (doubling Eurydice) is an involving singer, but of riper-than-ideal tone for Monteverdi, while Hal Cazlet lacked the lyrical beauty with which he is supposed to attempt to charm Charon, the ferryman on the River Styx. Huw Rhys-Williams makes a sage Apollo and Joana Thome shines as the Messenger/Prosperina.The production may be successful if part of the idea is to leave the audience disoriented. The problem is, we don’t really know why.

Their fragile adopted daughter, Lily, takes a shine to the soldier Jack, who has returned traumatised from the Front. The dark, gothic undertone of the opera comes from Lily’s uncle, Crom (another faded Celtic hero), from his dark laboratory in the cellar of Ma and Da’s pub, his unconventional experiments are designed to produce a race of super warriors.Riley’s libretto has real depth – though it verges on becoming a cluttered narrative; by contrast Plowman’s music is mostly sparse, almost incidental. Unselfconscious strains of music hall and cabaret whirl around entertainingly if indiscriminately and though there are extensive set pieces for each of the soloists, these generally do not – apart from the interpolated folk songs and a defiant war anthem – translate into musical or dramatic peaks. The gothic element, though, especially in Crom’s Scene II laboratory, is deftly handled, helped by Colin Richmond’s richly imagined period designs.The cast of five all give fine vocal performances, with the two strongest characters, the body-snatching Crom (Philip Sheffield) and the bawdy Ma (Fiona Kimm) being especially effective. This is an ambitious and often entertaining undertaking but it lacks a convincing sense of cohesion.

Leaving the audience in no doubt about the Feldmarschallin’s future sophisticated conquests or the earthly delights the naive young couple will encounter, separately, after its end.Swaggering and satisfyingly masculine, Sarah Connolly’s Octavian is quite the randy young thing in the Feldmarschallin’s bed in an Act I that, in terms of acting and singing, is perfectly staged. The busyness of the business as the Feldmarschallin holds court during her toilet is well judged, with Alasdair Elliott and Caitlin Hulcup quickly establishing themselves as intriguers, Valzacchi and Annina, and Daniel Sumegi getting just the right level of boorishness as Ochs.The opera’s high point in the Act II meeting of Octavian, acting as Ochs’ Rosenkavalier, with his fiance is supremely satisfying thanks to the purity of Lucy Crowne’s voice as Sophie. The farcical complexities of Act III are carried through with a deftness of touch and, although there are several occasions when McVicar does not find enough action to fill the music, it is an entertaining and satisfying production.

Kokkos’ self-designed staging is visually highly effective, presenting the opera’s narrative line with exceptional clarity and truth, and the semi-abstract sets have an aptly timeless quality.In an ideal world perhaps the Swedish soprano Annalena Persson’s Isolde and the Canadian tenor John Mac Master’s Tristan would have more sheer beauty of tone and more power but in reality it would be hard to find two singers as committed and accomplished in these superhuman roles today. Both engage fully with their material – Isolde’s curse is potent, Tristan’s mad scene terrifying – and the result is that the audience is gripped throughout the long evening. The secondary characters – Robert Hayward’s bluff Kurwenal, Susan Bickley’s loyal Brangane, Alfred Reiter’s sorrowful King Mark – are all finely sung.But where the evening scores highest is with the conducting of Mark Wigglesworth and the playing of the WNO orchestra. The balance is superbly managed and the combination of passion and control flawless. On this showing, Wigglesworth is one of the great Wagner conductors of his generation, while the standards reached by the orchestra are of the very highest.This is another show that displays the world-class credentials of the Welsh company. Wagner fans should move heaven and earth to see this outstanding production as it tours over the next few weeks.

His expressionistic realisation of fifties suburbia might seem a long way from Tsarist or even Stalinist Russia but it helps us believe in the plight of the proto-feminist heroine, the boredom of her existence and her resort to murder.John Macfarlane’s stunning sets divide the stage, suggesting rooms in the Ismailov household from different perspectives and there’s a virtuoso piece of scene changing when Katerina’s sleeping quarters are refurbished before our eyes. Mimi Jordan Sherin’s lighting is equally sophisticated, the only possible miscalculation coming in the last act where the looming shapes of trucks bound for Siberia are not quite intelligible from the cheaper seats. Otherwise, this is a superbly integrated show in which every brutal detail, whether hilarious, harrowing or both, has been thought through and buffed to perfection.Making her Covent Garden debut in the title role she previously sang in Amsterdam, Eva-Maria Westbroek scores a personal triumph, combing vocal power and stamina with tonal warmth and alluring physicality. John Daszak makes less of an impression as her under performing husband Zinovy but that is in the nature of the beast. Other key cast members are returnees, none more striking than John Tomlinson, whose father-in-law Boris is a scarifying vaudeville turn. So what if the light and shade – and the politics – of the score are knowingly undersold. This is an evening of sex and violence in which the tension never sags. Orchestra and chorus excel.

But the objective should include improving on older productions. This new Traviata doesn’t.This is Irish director’s Conall Morrison’s first opera, and his inexperience shows in a presentation in which the main characters have no depth or complexity, though Emma Bell’s Violetta possesses flair and shows signs of life, ironically, in Act III. Elsewhere her singing relies more on instinct than security, and she fails to engage.Dwayne Jones steps in for an indisposed Rhys Meirion as Alfredo, and though his voice is occasionally beneath the notes and his acting brash, he makes a decent showing.More solid vocally but no more dramatically achieved is James Westman as the elder Germont. Of the smaller roles, Anne Marie Gibbons as Flora and Donald Maxwell as Baron Douphol make their mark.Moving the action to late 19th century Dublin is a fruitless exercise. The central image of Paris as the capital of sophisticated hedonism cannot be so easily discarded, and Germont’s objection to Violetta because she is a Protestant and his family Catholic is a nonsense. Worst of all is the new translation, which is one long string of cliches and fits the music awkwardly.Joan O’Clery’s costumes are, however, sumptuous, and Francis O’Connor’s sets for the party scenes impressive, though the last act is a mess.The evening’s best feature is Jonathan Darlington’s nuanced conducting, though it cannot redeem a misconceived, poorly executed concept.

It’s inelegant but effective, even with a few tricks missed. Act II’s storm is evoked by strobe lights alone while Act I’s denouement is played in symbolic but unhelpful darkness. With David Parry’s translation tweaked and the score pruned, the band is reduced to a none too expert 17-piece combo positioned stage right. A clever geometric construct occupies the remaining space, its three levels neatly suggest consulting room, bedsit and parlour. There’s also a giant Warholish poster of the heroine concealing Figaro’s shop.The singing outshines the playing. If Freddie Tong’s Bartolo seems too young to have a ward and Lukasz Jakobczyk’s Polish-accented Basilio is a John Cleese lookalike designed for physical comedy rather than fine singing, the main roles are decently taken. Nicolas Sharratt’s Almaviva is lyrically sung, hammy in his various disguises, gauche as green-jacketed lover. Serena Kay’s Rosina makes far more than a brave stab at the coloratura, putting across text and directorial concept with equal conviction. And even Berta’s one big aria is gamely dispatched by Susan Jiwey.The star of the show is however James McOran-Campbell. His confident, leather-jacketed Figaro is a fully realized portrayal, tonally mellifluous and forcefully projected. It belongs already in a bigger house and, perhaps, a subtler production.

Premiered in 1775 when the composer was just 18, this early comedy is arguably his most viable stage work written before the seven mature masterpieces. Though the plot – based around the heroine Violante, in flight from her lover Count Belfiore and disguised as a gardener – is complex, much of the score is worthwhile. But the piece needs more detailed acting performances and a more consistent comic tone than it found here.Herbert Murauer’s commonplace designs move it to the present day, diluting the 18th century class hierarchies that underlie the plot. With his English Baroque Soloists in the pit, Gardiner motivates the piece musically but it’s a long haul.The cast is variable, with some strong performances helping to maintain interest. Particularly good are the servant pair of Christopher Maltman’s Roberto and Patrizia Biccire’s Serpina and Sophie Koch’s well drawn Ramiro. Robert Murray sings well as Belfiore and Camilla Tilling is a feisty Arminda but I suspect this show was a lost cause even before Loy disappeared.

Fiona MacDonald gives Azucena, the hero’s tormented mother, a true emotional identity.A fledgling company tackling Verdi’s really quite demanding tale of woe is a bold statement of artistic intent. Opus 1 Opera’s policy is to stage an opera in its original style, just as the composer wished and indeed witnessed. The company uses young singers who are on their way up and ensures that some tour dates are in areas where there has previously been little opera. For all of that, Opus 1 should be applauded.Playing the young lovers Leonora and Manrico are Sarah Estill and Irakli Crigali. Both take time to establish but their second half performances have full-on passion. Coming between them and true happiness is the dastardly Count di Luna, played by Mario Solimene. Here is a striking singer making his character  interesting and intriguing. The trio’s excellent singing of Di Geloso Amor Spezzato brings their tensions and jealousies to the fore.The staging is colourful with some delightful sepia tones but in night scenes the singers’ faces are not lit. Major characters and the chorus create interesting groups but they are disconcertingly static. The Anvil Chorus could benefit from some physical vigourThat said, this is technically very good opera from an exciting company. Il Trovatore is being toured with Tosca and La Boheme and a spring tour is promised.

An international hit during the 19th century, La Juive tells a dark tale of religious intolerance as Jews are persecuted in 15th century Switzerland. Its reappearance in the repertory could hardly be more timely.And the Royal Opera makes a splendid case for it. The chorus is in magnificent voice, whether representing a vindictive populace or the Jews at their Passover ceremony. Dennis O’Neill triumphs in the complex role of the Jew Eleazar, half loving father, half vengeful fanatic, while Alastair Miles brings dignity to his equally ambiguous antagonist Cardinal Brogni, representative of the power of the church.Cardiff competition winner Nicole Cabell has some dubious moments with the coloratura flights of Princess Eudoxie but establishes herself as a performer to watch. As her straying husband Leopold, Argentinean tenor Dario Schmunck is fluent and assured.But the revelation of the evening is Marina Poplavskaya’s mesmerising reading of the title role, to which she brings a full armoury of vocal and dramatic skills. Fully inside the horrific plight of Rachel, she provides a genuine star-is-born moment for the audience, which hangs on her every phrase.Conductor Daniel Oren leads an emphatic account of the outstanding score, which impresses throughout and builds to a disturbing climax. La Juive comes back with a vengeance. It deserves a full staging by one of our major companies.

So it’s a great virtue of David Alden’s staging, wonderfully designed by Ian MacNeil and Gideon Davey, that it makes the whole experience so immediate and involving.The period is moved to the thirties, allowing for some stylish costumes for the humans, the gods and the goddesses and other witty visual conceits on the way. Indeed, Alden holds the complex narrative in a fine balance between drama and comedy, giving the moving situations genuine dignity but also providing full value in the plentiful comic relief.The show sounds as good as it looks with the leading Monteverdi interpreter Rinaldo Alessandrini deriving immaculate period-instrument performance from a much slimmed-down WNO Orchestra, with a few specialist players added. Translating the piece into English might nevertheless have been a better option.Neither Paul Nilon’s Ulysses nor Sara Fulgoni’s Penelope possesses quite the variety and authority these two rich and heroic roles require. But much of the rest is excellent, with a splendid team of parasitic suitors led by Neil Jenkins as the glutton Irus. Elizabeth Vaughan’s Ericlea is another interpretation that maximises on the possibilities. But taken as a whole, the show is distinguished and grips the attention throughout.

Liberties may be taken with the original – in terms of Faust himself resembling the composer, torn between the theatre and the church, and the action transferred to a run-down Paris of the Franco-Prussian war period – but it works infallibly as music theatre. Many scenes, such as Gounod’s village fair turned into a raunchy cabaret, could transfer easily to a hit musical, while choreographer Michael Keegan-Dolan’s perverse reworking of the Giselle story for the Walpurgis Night ballet is as brilliant as it is disturbing.Gounod’s varied and vivid score is well served. Conductor Maurizio Benini realises its huge theatrical potential and the chorus has a magnificent night. Polish tenor Piotr Beczala’s singing of the title role is wonderful, delivered in a constant stream of golden tone. Angela Gheorghiu may lack spontaneity and credible modesty as Marguerite but she sings much of it with individuality and imagination. The young Bulgarian bass Orlin Anastassov’s Mephistopheles has some distance to go in claiming the full possibilities of his half-sinister, half-comic demon but he sings it presentably.Memorable are Russell Braun’s generous-voiced, dramatically intense Valentin and Liora Grodnikaite’s touching and boyish Siebel, while Della Jones finds a great deal in Dame Marthe. All in all, a striking realisation of one of opera’s great warhorses.

A project associated with the departed Sean Doran, the work is not described as an opera and isn’t in any meaningful sense. Apart from a few tiny choral sections, Shan Khan’s rap-like verse text is spoken over a flimsy incidental score, incorporating north African musicians as well as Asian Dub Foundation’s heavy beat, conducted by James Morgan.Dramatically, this is not just the story of Libya’s charismatic leader, hated by the West for decades until a recent rapprochement with Tony Blair (who makes an appearance in the show) but of Libya since 1911 and occasionally the temptation to stuff in too much history clogs the flow. Elsewhere the piece relies mainly on the abundant energy of actor Ramon Tikaram in the title role. None of the other parts have any meat, though Martin Turner’s Reagan is noticeable as far as the cardboard-cut out parody allows him to be.Visually, things are better, with director David Freeman, designer Es Devlin and video design from Burst TV London at least keeping up a momentum of imagery. But dramatically the piece is naive and patronising, while the music does little more than add a bit of vaguely relevant atmosphere. If your local sixth form college could come up with something like this, you’d be proud of them. But at ENO it looks and sounds like under achievement, big time.

This was due to conductor Peter Schneider’s love and understanding of the work and to the Bayreuth orchestra.No less the magic was due to the leading singers, almost all unchanged since the premiere of this Tristan und Isolde last year.  Nina Stemme’s Isolde looks young and slender. Her soft singing is often exquisite but she is inclined to press her voice in dramatic moments.  Robert Dean Smith has come to the great heldentenor roles by the right route – via the lighter roles such as Lohengrin and Stolzing – and his voice shows it. Petra Lang is almost certainly the finest Brangaene on the Wagnerian stage today. Hartmut Welker’s Kurwenal gave us some splendid singing at the end of the third act but aroused real sympathy as he was compelled to play this tough, strong, devoted follower of Tristan as a doddering, sentimental old man. Sympathy as well as admiration too for Kwangchul Youn, who sang King Marke with great beauty and feeling despite the handicap of a neat grey overcoat, collar and tie.Which brings us to the producer Christoph Marthaler and designer Anna Viebrock. They do not attempt to change the story, merely trivialise it. Some of the world’s most exquisite music is not honoured by Isolde singing the Liebestod several feet away from Tristan’s corpse, then climbing into Tristan’s empty hospital bed and pulling the sheet over her head to die neatly. Giggles are not normally the response to the opera’s ending.

Since then it has been a follower of many wayward styles.  What now?Das Rheingold opened with a really new and immensely effective setting. We were on the bed of the Rhine, a course paved with great boulders. The Rhinemaidens (Fionnuala McCarthy, Verike Helzel and Marina Prudenskaja, who all sang well) wearing cherry-coloured draperies sat in a row on these boulders. Above, following the course of the boulder bed, was a rippling projection of the underside of the surface in which unfocused naked figures of Rhinemaidens swam.Producer Tankred Dorst, designer Frank Philipp Schlossmann and costume designer Bernd Skogzig achieved an exciting success with this and with the next scene where gods and giants meet – a set of effective walls and many steps providing varying levels, a fine setting for movement and dramatic grouping.But good staging goes for nothing if the musical side is disappointing. It is not surprising that Christian Thielemann is recognised as one of the leading Wagner conductors of today. The orchestra played for him with all its experience and understanding of this essentially dramatic score. And Thielemann had a fine cast of singers.Falk Struckmann is Bayreuth’s new Wotan. He has a fine, powerful voice and is an impressive actor, conveying all the chief god’s authority. Our own Andrew Shore had a well deserved success as Alberich, Arnold Bezuyen was an admirable, witty Loge, Michelle Breedt a fine Fricka and the rest of the large cast were all good with Mihoko Fujimura as an exquisitely sung Erda.

First, and of course due to the conducting of Christian Thielemann, the full splendour of the score which envelopes the audience in the amazing acoustic of the Festspielhaus. Secondly, almost all the acting is of a very high standard – Tankred Dorst clearly sees the characters as living people, be they gods, giants, dwarfs, or the occasional ordinary human being, not as symbols showing a modern parallel. Thirdly, the sets, although not always exactly as defined in the stage instructions (Mime’s forge appears as a sort of magic laboratory and there is no anvil, Fafner’s cave is under a fly-over road bridge), are effective and Dorst never departs from Wagner.One of the most exciting events in this Siegfried is a new singer in the title role. Apparently Stephen Gould had never sung Siefried on stage until this summer’s Bayreuth, which makes his command of the part and the vocal ease in singing it all the more remarkable.  A near-ideal Siefried, with a powerful, beatuiful voice and tall, masculine good looks.  His acting was strong, endearing and sometimes moving.Falk Struckmann completed his powerful, thoughtful and well sung Wotan/Wanderer. Gerhard Siegel as Mime and Andrew Shore as Alberich were excellent Nibelung brothers – one of the examples of brilliant team work in these productions. Linda Watson’s Brunnhilde was less than perfect, tending to press her voice beyond beauty and hampered by an elderly, unbecoming costume. Mihoko Fujimura’s Erda was again superbly sung.

This time the title role, sung last year by Sarah Connolly, is taken by the counter-tenor David Daniels and while his vocal agility is beyond question, the weight of his sound and his dramatic impact are less impressive. Sara Mingardo as the stoical Roman widow Cornelia also compares less favourably against last year’s Patricia Bardon and Katarina Karneus makes for a gawkified, Cherubino-like Sextus.On the plus side, Lawrence Zazzo – a counter-tenor in the ascendant – is suitably vain yet spineless as Cleopatra brother and rival Ptolemy and there are excellent performances from Nathan Berg’s Achillas – sure-toned, physically striking and brutal in his lust for Cornelia – and Rachid Ben Abdeslam’s highly camp Nirenus. His fluency in the dance routines is exceeded only by Danielle de Niese, who returns playing Cleopatra every bit as sensationally as before; energetic as anyone on the West End, yet she can also get her vocal gear around Handel’s demanding vocal lines.The exotic feel of Caesar’s height of the Empire officers (think Carry On… Up the Khyber and you’re not far wrong) and the Fez-wearing servants of the Egyptian palace are framed by a stage set of receding arches and a gently glinting background of mechanical waves, as if to emphasise a sense of ‘serious’ underpinning.This may not be everyone’s idea of a worthy realisation of a great historical drama but it’s unfailingly entertaining and meticulously executed.

While the Mariinsky production relied heavily on the absurdity of the scenario, director John Fulljames emphasises sharply delineated characters: particularly Kovalyov’s hunched, tramp-like servant Ivan, brilliantly played and sung by Paul Featherstone; a batty newspaper clerk (sharply realised by Simon Wilding); the Nose itself (Alexander Grove) parading in a body-length nose suit, whose proud snout serves as a bulbous, drooping stomach. And not least, there’s Jeremy Huw Williams’ Kovalyov (he whose nose, without warning, parts company with his face), whose returned self-confidence following the return of his nose, leads him to reject flirting with a passer-by at the opera’s end, in favour of trying to tempt the whole audience back to his flat.Alex Lowde’s sets recreate the grey, Kafkaesque downtroddenness (the barber’s and Kovalyov’s apartments) as well as the comically surreal (the curtain of dangling limbs at Kazan Cathedral and the eight foot-high pedestal desk at the newspaper office, accessed only by a ladder).If the notoriously high writing for the Police Inspector seemed to catch out Daniel Auchincloss towards the beginning, all the singing is nevertheless more than accomplished. Performed in English, the gags are immediate and Patrick Bailey’s chamber arrangement (for the 16-piece band) seems to disentangle Shostakovich’s often dense scoring, without any significant loss of impact. In the pit Bailey’s pacing is quick and clean.This is already the first revival of the Opera Group’s 2001 production and there’s every indication that this Nose will run and run.

Her increasingly desperate goal of tracking down the man she believes to be the human incarnation of this spirit is the basis of the story. Along the way we meet the traveller-knight Ruprecht, a fortune teller, a magician and Mephistopheles himself. Hardly the simplest opera to stage convincingly.Director Francesca Zambello sets the action in Soviet Russia of the twenties, with a dark, crumbling tenement block (brilliantly envisaged by George Tsypin) forming the main backdrop. Ominous luminous figures peer from windows, perhaps giving form to Renata’s neurotic feeling of being constantly scrutinised as a social outsider. Her early visitations are recreated by a young girl and a beautiful spirit, adorned in yellow and her ultimate burning at the stake following a failed exorcism in the convent, features her rising upwards in a (lift) shaft of light – perhaps finally being reunited with her spirit, who arrived down the same shaft. Less easy to rationalise are the dramatic cracking open of the tenement walls at two climactic points in the drama, a trick which seems only to jar.Tatiana Smirnova is gushingly lyrical as Renata, and not overly dark; for that inimitable chesty richness we have Evgenia Segenyuk’s fortune teller. Boris Statsenko perfectly judges Ruprecht as part would-be hero and part lacking control of his own destiny.Alexander Vedernikov, conducting, captures Prokofiev’s supernatural half-lights as well as the bold, powerful textures. Sumptuous yet lithe, the Bolshoi band sound every bit as polished – and possibly more involving – than the rival Kirov company, which enjoyed a concurrent residency at the Coliseum.

Conservative it certainly is, with not a hint of modernisation and with an unnatrualistic dramatic style (take the chorus, which finds it distasteful ever to look away from the audience). But the applause-inducing, painstakingly painted sets seemed to be just what the audience craved. Icon carriers, bells, smells and priests processed out of the cathedral in sumptuous period ceremonial gowns and the vaulted ceilings of both the Chudov Monastery and Boris’s kremlin quarters brought small gasps of delight. If the painted timbers of scene four’s border inn looked a bit ‘am dram’ and if the painted images of St Basil’s Cathedral seemed flat, the Polish garden of Act III is breathtakingly painted and delicately, glowingly lit.Mikhail Kazakov is vocally assured in the title role and projects a decent dramatic combination of stoicism and guilt-fuelled madness. Maxim Paster lends an impressive figure and an attractive light tone to Prince Shuisky, while Elena Manistina sings an occasionally shrill-sounding Marina. Among the smaller roles, Taras Shtonda’s scribe Pimen and Mikhail Gubsky’s almost too sophisticated Simpleton stand out.In the much more straight forward textures of this music (compared to the Bolshoi’s earlier production, Prokofiev’s The Fiery Angel) Alexander Vedernikov and his orchestra are no less powerfully impressive. Without a doubt, a monumental culmination of the Bolshoi’s opera residency this summer.

Both titles refer to the bored wife of Zinovy. Her father-in-law is a despotic feudal merchant and her boredom ultimately leads her to commit three murders before taking her own life. Shostakovich, in a departure from Nikolai Leskov’s story, saves her from also killing Zinovy’s young nephew, in a bid to endear her to the audience.If the lust and brutality of the original version are diminished, Valery Gergiev nevertheless makes a passionate argument for the reworking, leading his Kirov Orchestra to tense and blisteringly immediate playing. In the second night casting Larissa Gogolevskaya’s Katerina proved to be very much the heroine, despite her path of destruction, singing with a truly Slavic heft but not unduly so. Sergey Alexashkin convincingly doubled his age as the castigating Boris, and the other principals – Yevgeny Akimov’s long-suffering Zivony, Viktor Lutsiuk’s virile Sergei and Yevgeny Nikitin’s petty Police Sergeant – acquitted themselves well.What lets the production down is the dull staging, directed by Irina Colostova, in which the characters’ staid, self-conscious movement rob the scenario of its immediacy; and neither do George Tsypin’s unimaginative, wooden plank sets help.There is more menace than this in the Katerina Izmaylova. Thankfully this does at least come through with great vibrancy in the pit.

Based on Sheridan’s libretto The Duenna (1775), it’s a classic buffo scenario centring on Don Jerome, whose daughter Louisa he has promised – against her will, naturally – to the wealthy fish merchant Mendoza. After an intricate series of deceptions and disguises involving three couples, everyone ends up happy, apart from Mendoza, who finds out he’s married the duenna (governess).There’s little in the way of character development and the only real emotional outpouring is when Clara, who has joined the convent, sings of what she believes to be her abandonment – a role lyrically sung by Nino Surgulazde – and there’s so much text to get through that there’s little sense of pacing in the music.But the production, co-directed and co-designed by Daniel Slater and Robert Innes, is rendered in bright, Sevillian colour, not least in Jerome’s fairytale dream where he imagines his daughter wedding a fish-headed Mendoza and also producing fish-headed triplets. Viacheslav Voynarovskiy’s rotund, high-voiced Jerome and Alexandra Dursaneva’s matronly yet coquettish Duenna are the larger than life character highlights. Alan Opie’s Don Carlos amusingly attempts to instil good form and culture into his friend Mendoza and Lyubov Petrova sings with the proper resolve of a headstrong Louisa.Vladmir Jurowski, conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra, has the measure of Prokofiev’s brilliantly detailed score and delivers it with punchy efficiency.

And when the repressed daughter Gilda, and then her father Rigoletto, appear at the top of this tall structure, the effect is almost Muppet-like.But there are some nice touches. During the dramatic overture, Rigoletto, casually attired in jeans and short-sleeved shirt, is seen reluctantly donning his work uniform as court jester, highlighting the chasm between his personalities at home and at work. Gail Pearson, who recently suffered a foot injury, gallantly sings the role of Gilda. The static restaging of her scenes do affect the dynamic but her occasionally statuesque stance ties in well with the inert, doll-like figure her father would have her be.The sack in which Rigoletto keeps his work clothes is the one in which the body of Gilda is dumped upon her assassination, pointing up that all Rigoletto’s misery leads to his role at court.Pearson’s singing is first-rate, agile yet smooth and carrying a naive wonder that is utterly convincing, making her eventual tragedy the greater. Icelandic baritone Olafur Sigurdason is a magnetic Rigoletto, though on second night he sounded just a touch tired. Paul Reeves’ Sparafucile and Heather Shipp’s fur coat and lingerie Maddalena make a dynamic assassin-temptress duo.The only let down is Peter Robinson’s sometimes vague conducting, which neither projects the brittleness of the score nor the charm of some of the seemingly simplistic aria accompaniments.

There are some daring, discomfiting touches too, as in Hermann’s violent manhandling of the old countess as he tries to extract the secret winning three-card sequence from her and some macho, sometimes homoerotic antics at the gaming house in Act III.Creepily, when the countess’ ghost reveals itself to Hermann, to give him the three-card secret, it turns out to be one of the countess’ own pall bearers. Cutting Act II’s Pastorale entertainment does no harm in tightening up the drama but adding a staircase from which proletarians gaze at the action seems to add little.Pawel Wunder’s Hermann is a telling dramatic portrait of a man driven out of his mind by the twin obsessions of winning the hand of Lisa and learning the card trick. Vocally he sounded conspicuously tired but there was a clear sense that a better day would bring a powerful performance. Carole Wilson’s authoritarian countess and Matthew Hargreaves’ slickly rich-toned Tomsky are overall highlights and while Orla Boylan’s Lisa is well sung, her character appears ill defined.Stuart Stratford conducts with a flair for both the dance music and the high drama.

If this embarrassment wasn’t enough for someone of his social standing, he discovers the errant proboscis parading around as a higher ranking state councillor.All works out well in the end – the nose is caught trying to leave the city and is returned to its owner – but the absurd scenario cocks a snook at hierarchical authority, while exploring themes as subtle as our willingness to compromise in the face of loss and as crude as equating Kovalyov’s rhinal inadequacy with the loss of a different appendage.Zinovy Margolin’s sets offer a rooftop view of St Petersburg apartment blocks, with the stage’s backdrop representing the ground surface. This gives us the sense of a knowing outsider’s view but the surreal, dark circus on stage never fails to knocks us sideways. The score, featuring popular dances, strumming balalaikas and a ‘double’ letter-scene (in a parody of 19th-century opera) is equally colourful and bewildering.Vladislav Sulimsky sings well as the conkerless Kovalyov, though he can’t always be heard, and Tatiana Kravtsova makes an imposing presence as Praskovya Osipovna (the barber’s wife), not least thanks to an ample lower register some tenors might kill for.There are strong performances across the large ensemble cast. This is a thoroughly entertaining music-theatrical riot that, beneath its comic-surreal sheen, actually answers many of the questions it poses.

He has looked at this well-known piece with a fresh eye and imbued it with a strong feeling of time and place, concentrating on the strong storyline. This means that the music flows naturally from the situation, as Verdi intended, rather than the plot being used merely to link the great arias.Wisely, Hayes has chosen Elroy Ashmore to design his sets which, considering the restrictions of the limited staging, never ceases to surprise. Hayes opens with the rarely performed auction scene which, when the draped cloths are removed, reveals a striking black and silver art deco set. This is transformed into a sunlit veranda in front of the audience, then becomes a voluptuous kasbah and finally the rubbish-strewn death bed finale.Hayes has also chosen singers who can act, most notably Lee Bisset as Violetta, who appears in full command of the role, vocally veering from strident coquette to the soft pleading tones of a woman in love. Julia Sporsen as her friend Flora and Olga Verizhnikova as her maid Annina are also good.Michael Bracegirdle may not look particularly boyish as Alfredo, but he sang well, while Adam Miller proved popular as his father and there’s sound support from the small orchestra conducted by Anthony Legge.Hayes successfully melds all these ingredients, with additional business, which add to the changes in atmosphere in this story of selfish and selfless love.

A two-hander with coarsely poetic dialogue and an almost-happy ending, the opera recounts the unlikely affair between an innumerate boxer at the end of his career and a maths lecturer, herself the victim of an abusive marriage some time in the past.It is staged with winning economy by Lindsay Posner and designer Paul McKintosh. With 13 expert instrumentalists semi-concealed and an iconic silver-grey tree positioned centre-stage, the action is forced forward, framed by an ersatz proscenium arch constructed of ring ropes. Neil Austin’s lighting is crucial, the numbers that variously affect the lives of the protagonists not only chalked up on the walls but suspended in fluorescent tubes of red and blue.And yet, even with the action divided into 21 short cinematic scenes, the evening feels longer than it should. Perhaps this is because the music content is oddly peripheral. Accompanimental textures chug along happily enough, variously allusive, until, for no particular reason, different harmonic and rhythmic configurations arrive to supplant them. Some stretches are touching, others dull or cheesy. This does at least mean that Michael Hastings’ text retains a primacy rare in contemporary music theatre. Tonight’s protagonists ensure that we catch every word. While Andrew Slater as a sympathetic Patsy is taxed by some of the low notes, Helen Williams gives an extraordinary performance as Avril. Surely too young for the part as conceived, her voice is in terrific shape and her acting is too.

But with some of the extraneous action removed, one can focus better on this largely intimate comedy.The major returnee is Alessandro Corbelli, though he swaps the role of the trickster Malatesta for that of the duped old boy of the title. It is a masterly assumption in every way, worth travelling a long way to see. Corbelli is the authentic buffo tradition come to life before us.Taking Malatesta this time round is Christopher Maltman, assured as ever and presenting a slightly repellent, whey-faced individual. American tenor Eric Cutler fields an Ernesto with many bel canto graces, though Miller’s foppish reading of the part arguably helps rob the young lovers of sympathy. So does Aleksandra Kurzak’s brittle Norina, ably sung but delivered with little in the way of warmth or charm. She never recovers from the slap she gives her elderly husband – always a tricky moment and here a fatal one.Bruno Campanella’s conducting is also wide of the mark. The overture is mannered and lacks verve, while the whole performance needs more precision and spirit. A patchy revival then, but with some good elements and in Corbelli’s brilliant Don Pasquale a genuine star performance.

The plot – telling of the Saracen sorceress’s doomed attempt to hold the affections of the Crusader Renaud – is archetypal and has been set by numerous composers. In Gluck’s intensely dramatic version of 1777 he makes one of his greatest contributions to the French operatic tradition.But Buxton’s approach goes wrong on a number of counts. Aidan Lang has shown himself a remarkable administrator but there’s a worrying lack of stagecraft in this show, with too many of the principals looking unconvinced and unconvincing in their movement. Maxine Braham’s choreography is sometimes misconceived. The attendants of Hatred conjured up by Armide look like refugees from a touring version of The Rocky Horror Show.There are some good things among Jason Southgate’s designs, notably an imaginative realisation of Armide’s enchanted palace, strikingly lit by John Bishop.Among the singers, Todd Wilander’s Renaud gets stronger throughout the evening, eventually reaching noble heights. Frances McCafferty commands the stage as Hatred and Roderick Earle is a decent Hidraot. But though she looks a temptress, Rosana Lamosa’s Armide lacks the vocal and dramatic stature to do justice to the grand tragic heroine and her English diction is poor. Indeed generally not enough of Amanda Holden’s translation comes across.Conductor Robert King needs to help his singers more but otherwise he gives a dynamic account of the remarkable score and the orchestral playing is often exciting.

So, too, return the giant masks hung on high, representing the decapitated heads of Turandot’s foolish suitors. The Executioner grinds his sword on a huge rotating wheel and if the lowering giant lunar disc doesn’t make you catch your breath, the descent of the Emperor on his golden throne – though slightly wobbly on the first night  – certainly creates a stir.Vocally, this is more satisfying than its most recent revival, last year. Ben Heppner is heroic, if a touch heavy-sounding, as Calaf and his acting is self-conscious – but this is hardly a naturalistic setting. Greek soprano Elena Kelessidi sings a touching, self-sacrificing Liu and the fluorescently dressed Ping, Pang and Pong (sung by Jorge Lagunes, Robin Leggate and Alasdair Elliott) make a highly dynamic trio.Francis Egerton brings vocal characterisation and gravity to the Emperor, a suitably impressive performance for his last production before retiring from the Royal Opera. That really leaves only the ice-queen Turandot herself and here Hungarian Georgina Lukacs gives a steely, unwavering performance of penetrating intensity.The Royal Opera orchestra delivers Puccini’s score – combining Stravinsky’s modernism, Debussy’s impressionism and Wagner’s rhetoric – with glinting detail under Hungarian-born conductor Stefan Soltesz.

In this second casting, Audrey Stottler’s confident soprano retains the power and stamina for Turandot’s entrance aria In questa Reggia but is tonally unalluring.A game presence prone to the striking of dramatic poses, she seems less plausible as a love object. She is however a veteran of the Berio completion as well as the more conventional abbreviated Alfano version heard tonight, prompting the thought that we ought to hear all the options at Covent Garden.Not that Berio’s subtle harmonic shifts and tonal ambiguities would suit Sally Jacobs’ bold and fantastical Oriental designs which, assisted by F Mitchell Dana’s dramatic lighting, remain such a big part of the show’s appeal.The Calaf, as in 2005, is the personable Yu Qiang Dai. He has a potentially fine, lyrical instrument, ringing on top but his rapid vibrato and pressurised delivery often result in off-pitch singing, although he does recover for a Pavarotti-style Nessun Dorma.Susan Gritton as Liu offers the evening’s most reliable and touching portrayal. Two of the house’s Jette Parker Young Artists survive the commedia dell’arte machinations of Pang and Pong without making a particular impression. Tall, vocally secure and stiffly acted, Arutjun Kotchinian’s Timur is his first in the house, while septuagenarian Francis Egerton sings his umpteenth – and final – Emperor Altoum. The conducting of Stefan Soltesz, patently less sophisticated than Pappano’s in his recent Tosca, is of a piece with the production’s essentially pantomimic approach.

But Mike Ashman’s staging, aided by Amanda Holden’s excellent translation, clarifies the action of a cumbersome plot about a lovelorn blacksmith called Henry Smith, the libidinous Duke of Rothsay and the woman in between, Catherine Glover.Occasionally, the use of highly stylised gestures for the chorus proves unfortunate but the general tone is upbeat and all the main players define their characters and relationships with skill.The singing is more mixed. Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts is taxed by the long and demanding role of Smith, though he is willing and focused in his portrayal. Mary Hegarty is no less spirited as Catherine but she often sounds out of sorts and her coloratura is sketchy, notably in a rather unnecessary mad scene which is one of the librettists’ less happy ideas.Vocally and dramatically firmly in the picture are James Rutherford’s Elvis-lookalike Duke, Yvonne Howard’s sophisticated gypsy queen and Donald Maxwell as Catherine’s concerned if busybody father. Bizet’s score, presented here in a cleaned-up edition, is regularly delightful, and conductor Martin Andre is exemplary in delivering it. The work will never become a repertory piece but this is a worthwhile and largely successful revival.

Even these are no great shakes, and the remainder ranges from the respectable to the commonplace. Conductor Steuart Bedford has drafted in more Mozart from elsewhere to provide some stiffening.But the fact is that The Philosopher’s Stone, to a libretto by Emanuel Schikaneder – who also wrote that for The Magic Flute a year later, and left his musical stamp on this score too – is an interesting musicological discovery rather than a worthwhile stage piece, and though Garsington shows initiative in offering it for the Mozart anniversary, its pantomimic fantasy plot falls far short of The Magic Flute and the music simply cannot compete.The company does it very decently, with director John Cox and designer Peter Ruthven Hall presenting its narrative clearly and with old-fashioned craftsmanship. Bedford leads a solid musical performance, and the cast acquit themselves well, with strong standouts from Leigh Melrose’s Lubano, Damian Thantrey’s Sadik and Michael Druiett’s rousing villain, Eutifronte. Amy Freston has a mixed night as Nadine and Iain Paton struggles a bit with Astromonte’s coloratura. But we’re unlikely to see it again until the next big Mozart anniversary in 2056.

Made up and dressed in Chinese garb, Robinson performed his routine silently, and even gave newspaper interviews through a Chinese ‘interpreter’.The production begins with the trick that killed Robinson – the ‘bullet catch’, which went fatally wrong at a performance in Wood Green in 1918 – before Herrmann deftly steps in to narrate, and take part in, the tale from the beginning. Even within this unfolding backstory there are flashbacks, seamlessly delivered. Richard Morris and Sophie-Louise Dann deftly play the roles of Robinson/Soo and his domestic and professional partner Dot. The most challenging vocal part goes to the countertenor role of Ping, Robinson’s lackey-cum-interpreter, sung with abandon and faux-Chinese comic flair by Andrew Watts. As narrator/MC and himself, Herrmann is brilliantly played by Paul Leonard, dropping his own fake Eastern-European accent to reveal a true Yorkshire upbringing as he recalls Robinson’s decision to transform his act.Raymond Yiu’s music largely comprises skilfully executed pastiche salon numbers, interspersed with more modern-sounding incidental padding. And Warren’s pithy words provide structure, humour and strong storytelling. while director Martin Duncan employs a pier-like central stage extension and cabaret-style tables, and a conjuring trick or two, hinting at a show within a show.

A rollicking and at times rude disquisition on sex and marriage from the point of view of women, it describes the poet encountering a group of female fairies, and witnessing the nocturnal meeting at which they air their grievances.Paul Bentley’s libretto derived from it forms the basis for this one-act opera composed by the Belgrade-born composer Ana Sokolovic, which was a hit in Toronto a year ago. Now the small but enterprising Canadian company brings it to London for its UK debut.Despite the colourfulness of subject and characters, it’s not an especially dramatic piece, and long enough at just over an hour. Sokolovic’s music, scored for ten singers plus a six-piece band including an accordion and plenty of percussion, trawls through the minutiae of modernist gestures and its sound-world is appealing, though few of its ideas leave any solid mark. Dairine Ni Mheadhra conducts the committed group efficiently.More memorable is Michael Cavanagh’s lively staging, which engages with the text’s brassy, bawdy women and their complaints, and Michael Gianfresco’s designs, which include some weird and wonderful fairy costumes.A strong team of performers, too, with each character nicely individualised. Maintaining a strong level of audience engagement in particular are John Kriter’s Snarlygob and Laura Albino’s feisty Bridey.

But for others, this dizzying, upbeat Viennoiserie will prove something of a spectacle. Tom Hawkes, director of OHP’s Die Fledermaus in 2004, returns to the dancefloor, tipping the action into the twenties, hardly the waltz’s heyday but the bobs and low-waistline frocks work well, as does the period’s intoxicating spirit of hedonism.The success of this show hinges on a finely cast central couple. Rebecca Caine is clean-voiced and glamorous as the bankable widow, Hanna. Her first entry, at the Pontevedrian Embassy party in Paris, doesn’t have the impact it needs (despite her bringing along her husband’s remains in an urn) but she has a rock-solid stage presence, is a natural in the dance routines and performs a ravishing Vilja in Act II. Philip Salmon is suave and noble as Danilo, Hanna’s former lover, who still harbours affections for her, a role to which he offers true emotional depth, though his dialogue delivery isn’t in the same league. Their scenes together are touchingly intimate oases between the comic romp and the showy spectacle.Alongside them is Oliver White’s strongly characterised performance as a camp, simpering Njegus, and there are fine performances too from Nicholas Ransley’s Camille and the (married) object of his affections, Valencienne, sung by Charlotte Page.The nationalistic set piece opening Act II, danced by tennis players at Hanna’s palace garden, is exuberantly done, a high-point – along with the dancing waiters and cancan girls at Hanna’s second party – of Jenny Weston’s choreography.John Owen Edwards, also returning after 2004’s Fledermaus, keeps the spirits high but also taps in to the occasional streak of melancholy. For those willing to submit to it, this is a powerful argument, as Hanna notes, that “three-four time causes one to lose three-quarters of one’s virtue”.

Jean Kalman’s set for Act I could be a Bosnian detention centre – neither the prisoners nor their gaolers are uniformed – with its naturalistic clutter of filing cabinets, metal cages and knocked doors.Act II has a more timeless feel, basic backcloth, bare stage and only some noisily dripping water to intrude on action launched in near darkness. Prettifying snow falls in the warmly lit final tableau.Taking over from Simon Rattle’s period forces, Mark Elder’s LPO offer finely honed textures without much forward thrust or rhetorical heft at key moments. The great Act I quartet is simply too slow. Nevertheless, by the end of the opera, Anja Kampe’s Leonore does acquire a radiant edge. This is her British stage debut as it is for Torsten Kerl, her faceless Florestan. Brindley Sherratt’s Rocco has the low notes as well as the acting skills on which this kind of reworking relies. Andrew Kennedy’s Jaquino is less impressive, but then he is often made to project from behind wire fencing, emotionally caged off from his Marzelline.It is in that role that Lisa Milne, feisty veteran of 2001, offers the night’s most dynamic portrayal. The ‘jilted lover’, seated with her legs dangling into the orchestra pit, is pointedly unable to join in the general rejoicing at Leonore and Florestan’s reunion. Peter Coleman-Wright’s Don Pizarro and Henry Waddington’s Don Fernando are petty bureaucrats, patently anti-iconic. To the minor role of First Prisoner, the young tenor Nathan Vale brings pathos as well as beauty of timbre, a potential star.

Vocally, the latter is the stronger of the two, though Walker’s Un’ aura amorosa is suitably dreamlike.The maid Despina, sung by Lillian Watson, is less obviously spunky than usual but no less effective for that, despite her dowdy attire. And while the sisters Fiordiligi and Dorabella, sung by Sarah-Jane Davies and Doreen Curran, both sing well, it is Davies who repeatedly takes the breath away for her light richness and easy projection. For his part, Charles Johnston’s Don Alfonso grows in stature throughout.Leo Hussain in the pit not only moves things at a fair lick (occasionally leaving his wind players trailing) but taps in to the score’s heartfelt emotion. In this opera which raises a question over the constancy of love, there’s never any doubting Hussain’s devotion to the score.

It’s the disturbing tale – more a situation, given its dramatic stasis – of 12 blind men and women deserted in a wood by their guide, a priest. He is dead among them, though until his body is stumbled upon by one of their number, they continue to place their faith in him. The young Swiss composer Xavier Dayer’s setting of the play is a commission by the Opera National de Paris’ young artists programme and receives its UK premiere as the opening production of this year’s Almeida Festival.Calling for only a quintet of musicians, Dayer’s diaphanous score captures well the sense of nervous, escalating realisation, effectively weaving the ensemble of 12 voices into the fabric of the music. Like Debussy before him, he is sensitive to speech-led text setting and yet captures the sense of distended time created by the protagonists’ recurring concerns with the whereabouts of the priest, the time of day, the threat of the sea (since they inhabit an island) and the fear of trying either to retrace their steps or venture forth on a new path. This is far more than an interesting experiment in static music drama, and the singing and playing, directed by Guillaume Tourniaire, are highly accomplished. But the dramatic void nevertheless creates the uncomfortable sense that we, the audience, are also held in limbo along with the protagonists.

In a gesture that can only be described as cavalier, Morris junks Dryden’s spoken text, which binds the lengthy musical interludes together. They are literally decontextualised, and what is left makes little sense.Morris’s directorial stance is thus to present King Arthur ‘as a pageant – a sort of vaudeville – a sequence of production numbers’. One looks in vain, however, for some real razzmatazz, and in any case Purcell and Dryden were aiming for something a little more coherent.They would probably also have assumed some spectacle in their lavish patriotic work first played in 1691, but it gets little of that in Adrianne Lobel’s low-key, backstage sets and Isaac Mizrahi’s mix-‘n’-don’t-match costumes, which look like a series of random raids on the wardrobe store.At least the singing is consistently good, even if some of the numbers are left high and dry with no text to cue them in. Conductor Jane Glover delivers a careful if sporadically energetic performance and the orchestra and chorus do pretty well. But this is an odd way to restate the company’s much vaunted commitment to English opera, and a limp end to a season that has hit a high rate of artistic successes – up to this point.

Yet Covent Garden’s trust in Jonathan Kent, former joint artistic director of the Almeida Theatre, has largely been well placed.Though less sumptuous than their predecessors, Paul Brown’s sets still capture the opulence of the Baroque church of Sant’Andrea della Valle, a split level allowing an upper arena for Act I’s climactic Te Deum. The Act II apartment of the manipulative chief of police Scarpia makes a feature of its barren bookshelves. The low-lying sloping wall of the Castel Sant’Angelo’s ramparts in the final act are comparatively sparse, but effective in revealing Cavaradossi’s isolation as he waits for the firing squad.The diva Tosca and her lover are effectively sung in this second casting by Catherine Naglestad and Nicola Rossi Giordano – she vocally robust and he with a suitable combination of lyric and dramatic qualities. Samuel Ramey returns to the role of Scarpia, this time more openly conniving, though you don’t quite buy into him supposedly losing his senses as he declares “Tosca, you make me forget God”. And similarly Tosca seems neither pained by Cavaradossi’s torture nor by Scarpia’s loathsome lasciviousness.What is truly compelling about this Tosca, however, is Antonio Pappano’s passionate grip of the score. It’s hard to imagine a more detailed, Technicolor rendering. As it happens, the Royal Opera’s greatest asset in this new production is not on the stage but in the pit.

When they do it is usually in the form of a double bill. They match nicely, each a delicate exercise in some of the composer’s preoccupations – clockwork precision, musical Spanishry and a lightly charged eroticism motivating the first childhood fantasy and a blend of parody and pastiche the second.They are good material for students – that is, when the director gets them right.But the first half of this pairing in Jean Claude Auvray’s production staged in a witty if minimal set by Num Stibbe and with apt costumes by Wojciech Dziedzic does not hit the spot.Dramatically, the performances are tentative and the sly, risque humour of the piece does not come over. There is flair in the singers, notably Pumeza Matshikiza’s Concepcion, Shaun Dixon’s Gonzalve and Huw Llyewelyn’s Ramiro, but a lot more definition is needed for the trick to work.L’Enfant goes better, partly because of the eager characterisation of the naughty child from Patricia Helen Orr, but also because many of the small roles – especially Simon Lobelson and Sigriour Osk Kristjansdottir as the Cats and Eliana Pretorian as the Nightingale – are so ably sketched in.Creditable playing from the orchestra under Michael Rosewell, but an evening that does not quite rise to the level of these two scrumptious pieces.

Her yobbish friends carry a large Durex hoarding, and her loser boyfriend haphazardly breaks into Ali G-speak. Mother no. 2 is Cara, who is visited in her birthing pool by three lovers (a leopard-skin-thong-wearing executive, a gondolier and a scatty, multibouquet-carrying cyclist – no I don’t get it either), all eager to identify the father. Dramatically, things improve from here on. No. 3 is Maddy, in prison, whose baby will be up for adoption. She creates a tense, anguished climax before the interval. Then there is massive Mary, whose emerges from the top of a wigwam, and Angela’s touching ode to her stillborn son, before the Cleaner finally mothers jelly-baby sextuplets, wheeled on to the stage in their incubators.Dave Bruce works an accordion, harmonica and recorders into his orchestral palette, blending short repeating fragments and scale-based gestures into effective musical backdrops. But the scenario and libretto are a let-down. Despite the cleaner/caretaker interludes, there is little sense of the tableaux hanging together.There is some particularly fine singing from Louise Mott’s forlorn Angela and Mark Richardson’s (also well acted) caretaker. But though Tim Murray handles the band with assurance, it is still hard to see why the Genesis people didn’t give Push! the shove.

The direction offers moment-to-moment insights into life in the Almaviva household, whether we are watching the central characters in action or the small army of servants following their every move with fascinated scrutiny. Tanya McCallin’s elegant sets and Paule Constable’s atmospheric lighting add to its visual appeal.Every one of the main players is excellent. The young American bass-baritone Kyle Ketelsen is the liveliest and most human of Figaros, ably seconded by the pinpoint precision and delectable personality of Isabel Bayrakdarian’s Susanna. Michael Volle’s Count looks constantly harassed as his schemes are outwitted, while Soile Isokoski sings a Countess of unusual dignity and intelligence. Her two arias are highpoints.Sophie Koch’s Cherubino is no less complete, combining the demeanour of a high-spirited adolescent male with the vocalism of a stylish mezzo. Among the smaller roles, John Graham-Hall’s brilliant Basilio, Jeremy White’s clearly drawn Antonio and Harry Nicoll’s un-parodied Don Curzio all register positively.Colin Davis’s conducting has its idiosyncratic moments but in overview he delivers a reading of warmth and fluidity.

Composed to her own libretto based on a story by the German romantic writer Ludwig Tieck, the piece has a dark fairy-tale ambience as the central character gradually discovers the dismaying truth about himself and his wife, who turns out to be his sister.John Fulljames’s production brings it up to date in Adam Wiltshire’s neat and tidy designs, which incorporate with ease its surreal or magical elements.Musically, it is an elegant, economical piece, which nevertheless conveys essential narrative and atmosphere.Owen Gilhooly is powerful as the increasingly fraught Eckbert, with Heather Shipp subtly evasive as his mysterious wife and Claire Wild memorable as the pervasively present Bird. Mark Wilde enjoys himself in the three roles of Walther, Hugo and the Old Woman.Together with the effective conductor, Patrick Bailey and his fine ten-piece ensemble these four soloists are joined by the fascinating Lore Lixenberg in the first half, comprising Weir’s shorter Really? and Kenneth Hesketh’s new Small Tales, tall tales, mostly based on works by the Brothers Grimm.

It emphasizes that desperate love across the social classes can blossom anywhere. However, even though we can suspend our disbelief at the tea-van’s waiter-service facility, it seems less likely that Adina, the wealthy object of Nemorino’s affections, would be hanging around t’mill retelling, as she does, the story of Tristan and Isolde.Still, performed in English, the production’s charm manages to win us over, not least with the visiting quack Dulcamara’s arrival in a gaudy pink and blue ice-cream van – allowing for the usual dubious-sounding Italian name on its signage. The cast is strong throughout. Colin Lee’s high lyrical tenor has an Italianate ring linked to a smooth, more English-sounding tone. His famous aria ‘Una furtiva lagrima’ genuinely halted the action of the opera.His Adina, Victoria Joyce is not only alluringly confident and effortlessly expressive on stage, but can wrap her voice around seemingly any ornamental decoration. Eric Roberts is entertaining as the dodgy potion-monger Dulcamara, though his fast patter could be more accomplished and Quentin Hayes is an effectively brutish Belcore.Mark Shanahan in the pit offers far more than a capable performance of the score, bringing it to life with expert shading.

In the final act the two stories interconnect when Levko visits the lake and helps Pannochka discover which of the other nymphs is the witch, who is duly dragged down into the depths by the others.In other words this is very much a folk opera with the first two acts focussing on Levko and Hanna, plus the local village elders – a group of comic grotesques – and the last beginning with the musically ravishing lake scene. There is a happy ending of course and much folk singing and dancing on the way, with Claire Gaskin’s choreography convincingly carried off by the principals and chorus.Throughout Jamie Vartan’s imaginative designs and Olivia Fuchs’s focused production are clear in presenting the narrative, characters and relationships and this rare and attractive piece is skilfully realised. So it is musically, with conductor Elgar Howarth securing a first-rate performance.Strong standouts from Peter Wedd as Levko, Darren Jeffery as the Mayor, Stuart Kale as the Distiller and Geoffrey Dolton as the village drunk.

Francis O’Connor’s sets move the action to Paris, with Norina an artist (why?) and the opening scene taking place in the all too public environment of a street cafe, where a long-running sight-gag with a waiter and a tray and all sorts of relationships going on at other tables, distract from the basic set up of the plot.Things settle somewhat for the last act, where a psychoanalyst/patient relationship makes sense in the duet between Don Pasquale and Dr Malatesta and the off stage serenade is wittily presented. Elsewhere, with rather too many funny faces being pulled and the potential cruelty of the deception performed on the aged bachelor insufficiently avoided, the approach lacks intelligence and – crucially – warmth.Conal Coad’s Pasquale is efficient though he fails to establish enough rapport with the audience to make us care about him. Also decently sung, Riccardo Novaro’s Malatesta emerges as all too manipulative and hard. Riccardo Botta’s Ernesto has some sense of style and a presentable stage manner though his top register is ungainly.Majella Cullagh’s Norina provides the best singing of the evening and she gives her character some essential humanity. But it’s an uphill struggle against a staging that fails to find the right tone for the piece and a sometimes slipshod musical performance.

Voices are splashily miked up yet rarely have anything more conspicuously melodic than an arpeggio to deliver. It is Alice Goodman’s poetic libretto, based on the historical events of Richard and Pat Nixon’s three-day visit to China in 1972, reflecting also on broader questions of American identity, which seems more intensely original.The protagonists begin as iconic figures in dramatically staged tableaux, variously conceived by Peter Sellars, his set designer Adrianne Lobel and the choreographer Mark Morris, only to end up as regular guys and gals lost in a dream. The acts get progressively shorter and the focus more intimate, a problem for any production and one not entirely overcome in this revival, intended to reopen the Coliseum but which Paul Daniel conducts now as a welcome guest.James Maddalena reappears as the president, a part he created and has made indubitably his own. Janis Kelly’s ever-smiling, oddly touching Pat Nixon is almost as assured, even if her body language is less authentic. As Madame Mao, Judith Howard has the evening’s stand-out aria and brings it off with aplomb, though she could be more sprucely accompanied. New to the line-up since 2000, Adrian Thompson’s alarming Chairman is sharply drawn to the point of caricature while Mark Stone’s Chou-en-lai has the right sort of inscrutable dignity.

As the evening went on and his period costumes and Mark Henderson’s imaginative lighting became familiar, things got, if anything, better. Certainly the last act – the execution scene at the fortress of Castel Sant’Angelo – is a clear improvement over its predecessor.So is Jonathan Kent’s production overall, with its rich, three-dimensional characters and focused narrative. This is a Tosca to savour.And not only visually. Musically, under the direction of Antonio Pappano, Puccini’s score registers with maximum impact. The second act in particular emerges as one of opera’s greatest achievements.Bryn Terfel’s Scarpia may be less the aristocrat and more the roughneck but he sing and acts with constant vitality and point. If Angela Gheorghiu’s diva has little vulnerability on display, her way with the character is detailed and persuasive and her singing immaculate. Of the three central roles it is Marcelo Alvarez’s Cavaradossi that makes the most complete impression. He is on top form and one’s heart goes out to him in his final aria.Impressive support too from Graeme Danby’s Sacristan, Carlo Cigni’s Angelotti and Enrico Facini’s Spoletta. The whole is a triumph and a show that could last as long as its legendary predecessor.

What remains is Il tabarro (The Cloak), a dark tale of a barge-owner’s murderous revenge on his wife’s lover, balanced by Gianni Schicchi, whose comic hero, in smartly clawing back an inheritance on behalf of an avaricious family, also carves up a decent slice for himself.Il tabarro makes a strong impact, its characters occupying a trapped world in which all they can do is work and dream. Philip Spendley’s Michele is just a touch under-ripe as the spurned barge-owner but Lenia Safiropoulou’s unhappily married Giorgetta is so vividly sung that you believe she deserves better than her current humdrum existence. Though he sounds occasionally overstretched, Gediminas Varna presents a passionately sung Luigi, especially effective in his two fevered outbursts. Martin Lloyd-Evans captures well the opera’s claustrophobia but oddly has Giorgetta exit stage as she retires for bed (when surely she should descend into the barge’s cabin), while if Michele really did light his pipe (unwittingly giving the signal for Giorgietta’s lover Luigi to appear) I must have blinked.After Tabbaro’s inclined barge, we could have been spared the slanting floorline of the dead man’s bedroom in Gianni Schicci – is perpendicular really such a bad thing? – but this ensemble piece is slickly executed. Milda Smalakyte’s lack of lightness marred her O mio babbino caro but unsurprisingly, David Stout’s Gianni Schicchi wins the lion’s share of the limelight, robust in tone and naturally comical.

It’s hard to imagine Britten’s yawning somnambulism and his elfin-like scherzo-writing completely and magically reflected on the stage.The late John Bury’s forest design is a living, breathing one, delicately lit by Paul Pyant, whose trees and shrubs are given life by human forms that imperceptibly merge into and emerge from the foliage. The stagework is a marvel, leading the eye into gentle, dreamlike confusion but with a sense too of the forest’s darker, subsuming powers. By contrast Puck rides around on a travelling leafy bough and the fairies glisten in Elizabethan court dress.It feels a shame to leave this world of moon-kissed half-lights as dawn rises over Act III but now returned squarely into the land of humans, we’re treated to a rollickingly entertaining rendition of Pyramus and Thisbe that puts the ‘am’ back into am-dram.Countertenor Bejun Mehta lends a looming physical and vocal presence to Oberon, his Tytania, the Costa Rican Iride Martinez, sounding a touch over-fruity and unintelligible. This was the only weakness in a cast that featured a wonderful quartet of tangled lovers – especially enriched by Timothy Robinson’s eloquent Lysander, and Kate Royal’s twice-pursued Helena. Matthew Rose’s charismatic Bottom joins a strong team of mechanicals led very capably by Henry Waddington’s Quince; and 11 year old Jack Morlen is a surprisingly assured, dwarf-like Puck.The young Israel-born conductor Ilan Volkov, in his Glyndebourne Festival debut, lovingly works the score for its sensual slumber, its brilliance and its humour.This Dream is a beguiling and accomplished operatic experience, which cannot be highly enough recommended.

Most familiar for his work as  associate director at The Globe, Tim Carroll’s solution is to focus on the intimate human story, while designer Bob Bailey provides minimalist white-themed props and dazzling, period-inspired costumes.Act II’s luxurious Parisian boudoir is implied by the importation of a single piece of furniture and both the port of Le Havre (Act III) and the Louisiana desert (Act IV) exist mainly in the mind’s eye. Puccini makes fierce demands on his protagonists.The tenor’s frequent high-octane arias are ferociously high-lying, while for the inconsistent heroine, the difficulty is also one of characterisation. The formidable Amanda Echalaz gives Manon her all and if this means that she’s scarcely a natural victim, her feisty, tigerish reading is supported by spot-on vocal timbre and technique. Sean Ruane, who began his professional career in the part of Edmondo, is ringing and ardent in his big Act III aria, Ah! non v’avvicinate!But it takes him a while to match words to line and tone and it was perhaps a mistake for the director to ask him to lift his substantial leading lady. He certainly has potential. Lynton Black’s aloof and pompous Geronte is well sung and fabulously well dressed. Under John Gibbons the orchestra (reduced by half in Tony Burke’s version) copes admirably with Puccini’s cod classicism and full-blown melodrama. The compactness of the venue enhances the immediacy of the show.

The composer also has a lot of plot to deal with – the Russian princess of the title unwillingly falls in love with the man who has murdered her fiance and by the time her revenge has struck down his brother and mother she is racked with guilt, and takes poison. Giordano has difficulty getting basic information over to the audience in a way that sustains musical interest. He also presents his leading characters with too few aria opportunities.Despite the piece’s faults, Opera Holland Park make a decent case for it. John Lloyd Davies’ production to period designs by Bob Bailey maintains a clear narrative and we are able to believe in the characters and their situations.Yvonne Kenny makes a more than presentable attempt at the title role, bringing some class and stature to the part even if it’s not really her repertoire. A grand Italian diva of the old school is wanted. The Australian tenor Aldo Di Toro is well equipped for the demands of Loris and his strong tone consistently impresses. Both Stephen Gadd’s De Siriex and Natasha Marsh’s Olga make much of their opportunities in supporting roles, while Brad Cohen’s astute conducting brings out the best in the piece itself.

The production is based on Stephen Langridge’s production for the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in 2004. George Souglides’s white-frame set is introduced by a rotating projected 3D image of the exterior outline of Count Almaviva’s Seville residence. Inside, its open walls, doors and windows allow full view of the comings and goings, merging the boundary between the private and public.The central couple, Figaro and Susanna, give winning performances. Olaf Sigurdarson’s Figaro not only has a ringing bass voice but the comic timing (and sometimes the semi-deadpan expression) of Freddie Starr, but with twice the magnetism.Sophie Daneman is a charming Susanna, sweetly besotted with her groom, yet sexily undressing down to a slip while exchanging outfits with the Countess in her ‘Deh vieni’. If Howard Reddy’s relatively spineless Count makes us care less whether he ultimately learns his lesson after his philandering, his Countess, Rebecca von von Lipinski (after an unsettled opening ‘Porgi amor’) gets better as the opera progresses. Frances Bourne makes for a brilliantly awkward yet rebellious Cherubino, complete with Che Guevara T-shirt and red-starred beret and with amusing rock-god gestures during her love-song to the Countess. Kim Sheehan’s schoolgirl Barbarina also makes a strong impression.Christian Curnyn, music director of the Early Opera Company, occasionally lacks punch in the pit, but has a knack for keenly pointing the drama.Overall, it is a talented cast in a well conceived production and well worth a visit.

David Fielding’s production, to his own designs, restores it to the UK stage repertory for the first time in decades and shows that there is far more too it than the famous violin solo known as the Meditation.In the opera this represents the moment of the heroine’s conversion. Thais is a courtesan in fourth-century Egypt, visited at the height of her success by Athanael, a Christian monk who promises her eternal life. Susceptible to his persuasive powers, she turns to Christ and a monastic life. But he, meanwhile, having fallen in love with her, loses his faith and begs her to love him as she lies dying with a vision of heaven before her eyes.It is a deeply ironic tale that Massenet clothes in a score full of variety and passion. Fielding brings it up to date with a staging in which Anne-Sophie Duprels’s Thais is a rock star, with Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts’s Nicias the leader of her entourage. It works surprisingly well. Though Duprels is clearly not at her happiest as the sex icon of the first half and Ashley Holland rather tame as the religious fanatic Athanael, both rise to the challenge of the final duet in which their surprising personal destinies are revealed.Martin Andre conducts an accomplished reading of the score that certainly reclaims as a fascinating work.

Much of the show works well. Ian MacNeil’s designs, lit on this occasion by Paul Taylor, provide a vision of a stressed rococo palace where the rejected Polinesso plots his revenge on Ginevra, destroying her reputation and sundering her relationships with her father, the King of Scotland and her betrothed Ariodante. Matters are set to rights by the end, but the pain she suffers lingers on and adds to the disturbing feel of the whole. One or two points in the narrative – notably Polinesso’s crucial charade exposing Ginevra’s supposed infidelity – need to be clarified. Much else is thoughtful and visually apt.The singing too is mixed. A number of performances – notably the two leads, Alice Coote’s Ariodante and Rebecca Evans’s Ginevra – have enormous flair and imagination, though neither quite consistently hits the spot. Similarly, Patricia Bardon’s villain – complete with an unconvincing beard – does not quite deliver on its promise.More sure-footed are Peter Rose’s solid King and Sarah Tynan’s charming but vulnerable Dalinda, chief agent of Polinesso’s manipulative scheme. Paul Nilon is adequate as Ariodante’s brother Lurcanio, though his voice registers as monochrome.Matters would be helped were Christopher Mould’s conducting stronger, but it remains merely correct, lacks impetus both during individual numbers and in each of the acts as a whole.

No directorial gimmickry distracts. The three substantial sets designed by Ashley Martin-Davis echo the real Roman locations, statuesque and oppressive, atmospherically lit by Mark Henderson.All three principals reprise roles taken in previous revivals. Inevitably there is the warmest of welcomes for all-time favourite Dennis O’Neill, who made his professional debut with the company back in 1979, still in fine Italianate voice as painter patriot Cavaradossi. Deborah Riedel as Floria Tosca is every inch the flamboyant diva, jealous and passionate, so moving in her feminine vulnerability. The repellent Scarpia of Peter Sidhom dominates in a well-rounded study of brooding menace and calculated sadism. Alan Fairs brings needed relieving humour to his jolly Sacristan, with Daniel Chadwick as the hunted Angelotti.Puccini expert Julian Smith conducts with assured touch, drawing from the orchestra the full power and lyrical beauty of the emotive score.This co-production with the State Opera of South Australian is sung in Italian with English surtitles by Simon Rees, plus Welsh surtitles by Mary Jones for performances in Wales.

Bluebeard’s ruined castle interior, dominated stage right by a fallen chandelier, is precisely imagined by John Macfarlane. Stage left we’ve the seven doorways prescribed in Bela Bartok’s libretto, although David Finn’s muted lighting can make these difficult to discern beyond the stalls – the naturalistic treatment of their unlocking is not sustained throughout.Apart from Katalin Bogyay’s atmospheric recitation of the Prologue, there’s not an authentic Hungarian accent to be heard. Nevertheless Petra Lang sings wonderfully, her bright mezzo encompassing an immaculately tuned high C at the opening of the fifth door. A contemporary neurotic, scarlet-clad, she fully inhabits the role of Judit.Albert Dohmen’s weary businessman Bluebeard, prone to bursts of frustrated violence, casts giant expressionist shadows before abandoning his trophy wife to uncertain depths.Initially unremarkable in the pit, Kirill Petrenko builds a massive climax as she takes her place alongside, or rather is dragged offstage by, his previous wives.Revenge may or may not be sweet but the production misrepresents Schoenberg’s monodrama by transforming it into a commentary on Bartok’s two-hander. The stripped down set confirms that we haven’t left Judit’s inner world – same portal, no forest – while the composer’s unnamed protagonist is costumed to resemble her. Bluebeard himself is cloned through the introduction of an entirely apocryphal non-singing actor. Even with Angela Denoke giving her all, the result is not compelling dramatically. The silent, ersatz Bluebeard is subjected to multiple stab wounds, the psychology seems crude.

The innuendo is not exactly subtle but it’s never too rude… you can take granny and the children to this.Delightful humour and pathos with a touch of tragedy surge over the audience as these powerful, excellently cast singers act out Mozart’s fine opera. There is a unity, a camaraderie, between the cast and musical director/pianist Igor Kennaway that is infectious. It warmly envelops and includes the audience.David Durham as Giovanni is a towering rogue, with a cheeky eye for the front row as well as the women. Donna Elvira, as his scorned lover, and Donna Anna, as his seduced lover, both have fine, heart-rending soliloquies that raise the hairs on your neck. And there are many times with the entire cast in full throat that bring tears of joy and admiration to the eyes.They unfold the story so naturally around Simon Higlett’s effectively minimalist set that I could easily have been there in 17th century Seville, enjoying a glass of wine in the sun, listening to talk rather than song. You really don’t need to be an opera buff, nor even know anything of Mozart’s naughty Don, to thoroughly enjoy this.If this wonderful production is not at a venue near you, then jump in the car, you will not be disappointed.

But from act two onwards the rotating stage is in overdrive and while the cast’s movement upon it is often deftly choreographed, the feature becomes an over-used toy – even revolving us back to Prince Orlofsky’s villa after the final jail scene.Lawless’s translation (in collaboration with Daniel Dooner and Katy Brand) may mean the gags are more immediate, but the emphasis is on titillation, innuendo and pants-down humour. If we are witnessing the decay of pseudo-aristocratic Viennese society we should at least have a whiff, of said uprightness, even if superficial.Thomas Allen’s Eisenstein and Robert Tear’s Dr Blind (however well preserved these sexagenarians are) look set rather for cocoa and bed than a champagne-soaked ball at Prince Orlofsky’s, at whose (actually quite drab) ball Rosalinde and Adele, make un-showstopping appearances. And then there are the cosy little jokes from Orlofsky about the Glyndebourne audience trotting into the gardens for its own champers (and, later, returning the worse for consuming copious quantities of it).The singing though, is good throughout, with particular fine performances from Stacey Tappan’s vibrant and direct-sounding Adele and Jonathan Veira’s brightly resonant Frank. Bonnaventura Bottone is an amusing theatre darling as Alfred.In the pit Vladimir Jurowski conducts with a razor-sharp attention to detail, revealing both the graceful and the erotic sides of the waltz.

The elderly ruler of Ukraine, plotting with Sweden to win autonomy from the Tsar, marries the young, vulnerable Mariya, thus causing a rift with her father, Kochubei, who shops him to Peter the Great. But Peter believes Mazepa, who promptly has Kochubei tortured and then executed. Mariya, meanwhile, loses touch with reality and in the final post-battle scene she cradles the dead body of her former admirer Andrei in her arms, singing a lullaby to his corpse.It is a consistently hard-hitting piece, visually updated in this production to the break-up of the Soviet Union and its unstable and lawless satellite states. Christian Fenouillat’s sets and Agostino Cavalca’s costumes are strikingly realistic and the acting and direction faultless.Marvellous individual performances from Gidon Saks as the noble Kochubei, from Robert Hayward as the vindictive anti-hero, from Tatiana Monogarova as the tragic Mariya and from Hugh Smith as Andrei.

His staging, with delicate period designs by Vicki Mortimer, subtly lit by Paule Constable, is visually elegant and probes this most complex of comedies with intelligence and perception. Arguably the humour is underplayed at first, but no one will feel short-changed by the end. The characters and the audience go through a profound and troubling experience.Musically, values are equally high under the direction of Ivan Fischer, making his Glyndebourne debut with an immaculately paced account of the score that proves him a Mozartian with few equals, though a touch more sparkle might be added. The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment is on excellent form.It is a well integrated, young and international cast, among whom Nicolas Rivenq’s Alfonso and Topi Lehtipuu’s Ferrando need a shade more definition and Ainhoa Garmendia’s Despina an inch more personality. But there are particularly strong performances, both vocally and dramatically, from Luca Pisaroni’s volatile Guglielmo, Anke Vondung’s flighty Dorabella and especially Miah Persson’s Fiordiligi, who despite one or two minor technical weaknesses (her trill comes and goes, and her vocal registers are not completely integrated) demonstrates a natural affinity with the role and with Mozart that will surely take her a long way.

But in Christopher Alden’s imaginative production, graced by Sue Willmington’s elegant period costumes, the drama comes over with vivid realism, even in the case of the 337-year-old heroine.Emilia Marty is sung by Cheryl Barker with easy command and her stylish personification blends chic with ennui. She’s solidly supported by tenor Robert Brubaker as Albert Gregor, Neal Davies as lawyer Dr Kolenaty and Graham Clark as an amiably daffy Hauk-Sendorf, one of Emilia’s innumerable lovers.There are equally pinpoint accurate representations of lawyer’s clerk Vitek from John Graham-Hall, his daughter Kristina from Elena Xanthoudakis and her boyfriend Janek from Thomas Walker, with John Wegner imposing as Gregor’s legal opponent Jaroslav Prus.But the whole ensemble is excellent and the opera grips from first to last.

Into their clutches falls Jack, a shell-shocked soldier home from the trenches, who does the odd conjuring trick himself. But Crum is up to something altogether darker in the cellar, involving bodies and human sacrifice and all three of the older members of the family turn out to be Celtic gods, about to make a comeback or alternatively take retirement in lovely Aberystwyth.It’s a wacky and original tale that engages because the comic-grotesque pace is fast and Plowman’s text-setting skilful enough to allow every word to be heard, though Louise Cannon’s Lily needs to try just a bit harder. The audience breaks into spontaneous applause on three occasions, such is the immediacy of the score, which uses a sophisticated form of parody – mainly music-hall songs – to great effect. The instrumental writing is marvellous.Conductor Michael Rafferty bounces it along and Michael McCarthy’s production hits all the right notes. Andrew Slater is the punch-drunk Da and Fiona Kimm has a whale of a time as Ma. But the whole cast is good, and the opera an outright winner.

Living as a humble shepherd, he has caught the eye of Elisa, sister of the tyrant Araspe. Araspe in turn yearns for Ptolemy’s wife Seleuce (unknown to Ptolemy, she was shipwrecked on Cyprus while being transported as a slave to Syria). Meanwhile Ptolemy has been reunited with his brother Alexander, who has been sent to kill him – and who has fallen in love with Elisa. It is a tale of estrangement, revenge, desire and the endurance of matrimonial and fraternal bonds.Director James Conway opts for a single set – a damaged pier – giving a static feel, though it is used imaginatively. Tolomeo is robustly sung by Patricia Orr, occasionally tripping up in the more sustained runs, but striking in her ‘Stille amare’ as Tolomeo takes his poison. Though Kostas Smoriginas’s Araspe is menacing enough, it is sometimes an unrounded sound. If Katherine Manley’s Seleuce outshone countertenor Christopher Ainslie’s Alexander, the star was unquestionably Laura Mitchell, whose Elisa was not only vocally agile and true, but deftly drawn in dramatic terms, effortlessly managing to stylise without affect.

In this case the Pegasus Opera Company, specialising in multi-racial productions, and English Touring Opera, have joined together to present the hour-long two-acter – twinning it with a short recital of Leoncavallo’s songs rather than the usual Cavelleria rusticana, forming the popular ‘Cav and Pag’ sequence.The small number of principals is already tour-friendly and the orchestra has been stripped back to an ensemble of six – including accordion and trumpet, for rustic feel, but stripping out the choir, which represents the receiving villagers – though a practical move, has a de-layering effect on the narrative.Still, the drama and pacing are expertly defined by Stuart Stratford’s warm conducting and the pocket-sized re-orchestration by Kenneth Chalmers generally works well on its own terms. There’s the occasional excess spinning of inner-part arpeggio figuration in the clarinet, even though it is admirably executed by Pete Furniss.Then for the singers. Omar Ebrahim makes a robust, if less than despicable, Tonio, weakening vocally only when pushing hard up top. James Cleverton is smooth-toned as the lover Silvio, more so than in his first half’s songs, which on occasion seemed pitched too high. The greatest contrast in voices comes between the husband and unfaithful wife pair of Canio and Nedda, with Bernard Abervandana sounding slightly rough against Alison Buchanan’s ample tone.Director Nikolai Foster doesn’t really get his cast to gel, but Neil Irish’s sunny, rustic set is resourcefully lit by Kristina Hjelm.

His burnished tenor still rings out triumphantly. He can shade it to a whisper, colour it to bring text and music into a meaningful alliance. And he can act. I doubt that Alfano’s Cyrano would have reached the ROH stage without his presence.For Henri Cain’s libretto renders Rostand’s play a series of tableaux lacking dramatic impetus. Characters stand around effusing inner emotions, the chorus contributions merely provide atmosphere. Yet Massenet’s masterly Don Quichotte shows the tableaux principal can work.Cyrano’s action judders along in fits and starts, notably in Act III, the siege of Arras. Soldiery drift wearily, keen to a bucolic flute melody, while the principals tear their passions to tatters. The orchestration is skilful, evocative, ardent in its chromatic cut, but there’s no rhythmic momentum to generate urgency, merely heated gestures.Alfano’s score lacks a coherent architecture while the Debussy-derived sound world melds uneasily with the bid to achieve a volatile Puccinian ebb and flow. The vocal lines oscillate between a functional rapidity and more formal utterances which fail to sustain an attempted long-breathed legato.However, Francesca Zambello gives Cyrano the full Broadway make-over within Peter J. Davison’s monumental period settings. Mark Elder and the orchestra realise the score’s every facet. And Domingo’s heroic and moving Cyrano is an irresistible force at the staging’s centre.Sondra Radvanovsky portrays a spirited, full-throated Roxanne, while a cast of stalwart singers just about flesh out the supporting roles. The evening is an undemanding, mildly entertaining experience.

But the show with which they celebrate that return is a little less sparky than it should be.Mozart’s opera is hard to bring off, both musically and dramatically and uncharacteristically director Tim Albery has not really got its measure. Though there is a strong dark side to the opera – from the opening attempted rape and murder, to the anti-hero going to hell in the tremendous final scene – its fundamental mode is comic and there are very few laughs here. James Rutherford’s Leporello is particularly lacking in humour.Tobias Hoheisel’s semi-abstract designs present a modern-dress cast with class differences indicated by the men’s headgear. A room with red velvet wallpaper, several doors and a row of chairs provides a dull set.Peter Savidge lacks charisma as the sex-obsessed anti-hero, with Maria Costanza Nocentini showing flair as Donna Anna and Henriikka Grondahl an accurate but small-voiced Elvira. Hilton Marlton is a respectable Ottavio while as Masetto D’Arcy Bleiker at least fields some much-needed vigour. Matthew Best is luxury casting as the Commendatore and duly impresses.But it feels a long evening – one or two of the extra arias hold things up – and Richard Armstrong’s slow and heavy-handed conducting, decades behind our present knowledge of period style in Mozart, does not help at all.

The tilted mirror over the stage makes a feature of a grand entrance for Butterfly (represented by a kabuki dancer) before the action begins, reflecting the swathes of red cloth trailing behind her, but for the rest (other than her climactic suicide, when the red swathes stream outwards from her as pools of blood) the view afforded behind the Japanese sliding panels remains unilluminating.A troupe of veiled bunraku puppeteers in jet-black act as narrative agents carrying lanterns for Pinkerton’s and Butterfly’s love duet and operating the puppet that represents the two-year-old boy Sorrow. But their black-streamer-waving dance at the arrival of the furious Bonze crosses disturbingly from background to foreground. As for the boy puppet, he is less touching than you might think. Next to his human counterparts he can not help but appear… well, wooden.This all detracts from the characters themselves, none of which seems to be clearly drawn. Gwyn Hughes Jones’s Pinkerton is unusually faceless, convincing neither in his ‘facile little gospel’ of happy-go-lucky love, nor in his love duet with Butterfly. Janice Watson, though vocally light and supple, seems unsure if she is playing a crushed flower or an upwardly mobile geisha. Alan Oke makes for a stony marriage broker, though David Kempster’s US consul Sharpless is effective as Pinkerton’s conscience.David Parry conducts capably and solidly, but fails to draw passion or tragedy from players or singers. In all, this lavish feast for the eyes leaves the ears, and the heart, starving at the table.

It prefigures the Gibichung Hall, where Gunther is a spineless, red-suited ninny, sister Gutrune a slinky temptress involved with Hagen, an executive type with a penchant for garrotting and asphyxiation as sexual stimulant.Hagen, apparently all-knowing, choreographs events, yet the New Age folk lurking at the drama’s periphery seem to disconcert him. They execute Brunhilde’s funeral instructions during Starke Scheite, upstaging the Immolation and finally inheriting the land. The meek perhaps?Bizarreries en route to this rum closure include an ailing Alberich appearing to Hagen in an airborne row-boat, the latter inconsequently fiddling with red tie and red ribbon echoing the Norn’s red rope, Rhinemaidens as bag-ladies and Gibichungs sporting horned riot-helmets. Characterisation falls victim to visual silliness – who is Hagen? Inept stagecraft vitiates important moments.However, Lisa Gasteen sings off words and colours the voice meaningfully, shapes Wagner’s long-breathed lines with consummate artistry to project a Brünhilde of commanding presence and sympathy – despite a hideous costume. John Treleaven’s engagingly boyish Siegfried was vocally somewhat hit and miss at the second performance.Yvonne Howard, the excellent Second Norn, should rightfully be singing Waltraute, here undercast. Antonio Pappano’s conducting sacrifices the score’s architecture to momentary effects and fails utterly to integrate tempos. Siegfried’s funeral music becomes a crude quick march. This ROH Ring is a mess best swept away fast.

Threading their way through much of the action are the twelve Indonesian dancers making up the Orange Island Dance Company, whose intricate interventions regularly support and comment on the narrative, though some of their appearances are surplus to requirements. In Tom Pye’s multicoloured sets and Elizabeth Caitlin Ward’s costumes much of the show looks ravishing.Where it is less certain is in ensuring that the performers act and interact with moment-by-moment definition. At best beautiful to look at, at worst the result is vague.Conductor Laurence Cummings leads a vivid musical performance, with ENO’s regular players given period-specialist support by members of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, but it needs a touch more dynamism. John Mark Ainsley is an articulate Orpheus, with Elizabeth Watts striking in her dual role of Music and Hope and Tom Randle making the most of Apollo. Ruby Philogene is attractive as Eurydice though not always smack on the note, while Brindley Sherratt ensures that Charon’s scene is memorable. The totality a rich and intriguing mix, though the show has not quite blended into a unified statement.

Several have selected early pieces to add to the mature classics that are recognised as works of genius. Unfortunately some of them prove rather slender.Certainly The Shepherd King, which Mozart wrote when he was 19, is no great shakes. The plot shows Alexander the Great discovering the real king of conquered Sidon in the person of the shepherd Aminta, who has no idea of his true identity and with some reluctance mounts the throne at the close. Along the way there is one great aria and a few good ones, amidst much that is commonplace. If the name Mozart were not attached to it, no one would be bothering with it.But here it is, in a production with some visual flair, self-designed – except for Susanne Hubrich’s costumes – by director John Lloyd Davies, who clearly has some ideas but cannot always get the performers to look as though they mean what they sing.Generally capable singing nevertheless, with Katie Van Kooten once again demonstrating star quality as Aminta and Peter Bronder bringing experience and gravitas to Alexander. Superior playing too from the period-instrument English Baroque Soloists in the pit and excellent conducting from Edward Gardner, who does everything that can be done to make the piece sound better than it is.

Chantal Thomas’ sets and Laura Scozzi’s choreography are on the right lines.What lets the show down is its pace and precision – it was not spick and span enough on the first night, while conductor Emmanuel Joel’s musical direction lacked verve and momentum – together with Kit Hesketh-Harvey’s translation. There are not enough good jokes and some of it is downright clunky.A shame, because the score is a winner, with an unending succession of brilliant numbers and a storyline that, however silly, maintains a manic interest.And many of the performances have energy and point. Lott has a whale of a time as Helen, sending herself up with some finely-tuned comic touches. Toby Spence hits all the high notes as Paris and is credible as her pretty-boy boyfriend.Strong support from Bonaventura Bottone as Helen’s dreary husband Menelaus, from Steven Page as the high priest Calchas and from Leah-Marian Jones as Orestes. With a bit of luck this operetta will gather pace during the run, but they’re presumably stuck with that limp text.

Inevitably they stayed away in droves. The result is Kuhhandel remained unfinished at Weill’s death.Ever enterprising, Opera North have revived it in Lys Symonette’s version based upon the librettist’s revisions (1970), which includes orchestrations of four important numbers left unscored.American arms dealer Jones’ tries goading neighbouring Carribean states into war hoping to sell arms to both. To pay for them, the near-bankrupt Santa Maria government continually distrains the goods of the poor and disenfranchised, exemplified by the troubled odyssey of young lovers Juan and Juanita.Weill’s coruscating score wryly exploits South American dance forms with their syncopated rhythms to lampoon the callous venality underpinning tyrannical governments. The score is both Weimar retrospective and looking foward to Broadway, a satisfyingly astringent blend of sweet and sour.In 1926 Weill wrote of  the “wit, pace and merriment in purest and most attractive form” of Offenbach’s operettas. Opera North forces certainly go for that, but David Pountney’s Grosz, Biergarten staging takes its cue from the barely disguised Third Reich allusions.There are military precision routines, scantily-clad, high-kicking dominatrices, a deal of drag and crotch-thrusting. The conscripted Juan wears Rambo gear. The General’s minders wear Spiderman balaclavas. The knowing translation alludes to WMDs, Iraq, et al but lacks subtlety and wit. Still, the piece is a must-see.

Based around a 13th century Yuan dynasty play, The Chao Family Orphan, it poses cultural and stylistic challenges on a dramatic level.Weir’s libretto concerns the canal builder Chao Lin, the son of a map maker exiled under Mongolian rule, whose workers enact the central play. In the play the General Tu-an-ku is responsible for the suicides of ‘Chao-the-loyal-civil-servant’ and his wife, whose orphaned son he later unwittingly adopts. Twenty years later the orphan learns of his story and plans his revenge on the general. Back in the real world, Chao Lin learns of his father’s death in exile and seeks his own revenge.The roles of the soprano, mezzo and tenor actors who enact the play are taken by the brilliant trio of Kishani Jayasinghe, Catherine Hopper and Allan Clayton. Their highly parodistic enactment of the Chao play is a high-octane Chinese comic romp, featuring Clayton’s bumbling doctor Ch’eng Ying, Jayasinghe’s hilarious pig farmer Kung-Sun Chu-Ch’iu and Hopper’s madcap trouser-rolled General Tu-an-ku. Outside of the play there’s humour in Anna Graca’s Mrs Chin/Old Crone and Caryl Hughes makes a strong impression in her brief appearance as Little Moon. Ronan Collett’s Chao Lin comes into its own in the last act, highlighting a rich yet robust baritone.Jo Davies’ production, with its gauze screens, complements the scenario’s multi-layering and Dominic Wheeler elicits impressively unswerving playing in a technically demanding score. This choice of opera seems to have caused all concerned to raise their game but no one here is exposed as out of their depth. Really a must-see music-theatrical event.

The words may seem odd in somehow defining a hotel but they spell out Falstaff’s central philosophy, the pursuit of which supplies so much oafish fun before he sees the error of his ways.The essentially single stage set showing a set of outdoor changing cubicles next to the hotel bar is spruced up in the last, nocturnal Royal Park scene with illuminated lanterns and shrubbery. Unfortunately there’s also the ubiquitous glitter ball, beneath which the celebrating company ultimately jives with various degrees of success.Though every scene in which David Stout’s Falstaff features shines on the stage, the larger-ensemble scenes – for instance the would-be ambush of Falstaff and Alice Ford and the appearance of Falstaff’s forest-scene fairies and witches – are brilliantly handled.David Stout’s Falstaff is utterly enjoyable, executed without affect but with an abundance of hidden sophistication. Vocally rich and characteristic throughout, he’s lovable for the naive pride in his girth, the even more naive belief in his irresistibility to the fairer sex and his amiable lolloping gait. Celeste Larenko’s Nannetta and Olivier Kuusik make for a vibrant pair of lovers and Loic Guguen makes an authoritative and resolutely toned Ford. Only Genevieve King’s sometimes disconcertingly dark mezzo and Tom Oldham’s occasionally thin-sounding bass are the slight vocal flaws.Otherwise it’s another slickly presented, well-sung production that again attests to the high standard of London music-conservatoire opera.

Peter Relton reflects this progression from darkness to light, an ironic gloss on Magda’s fate, with unobtrusive direction, which gives full rein to a first-rate cast.Janis Kelly returns as Magda, her masterly, understated portrayal the evening’s emotional epicentre. She brings a long-breathed elegance to Puccini’s soaring vocal lines, while her acting is rich in detail. I love the way she cradles Prunier’s head in her hands as he calls her Salome.Rafael Rojas, the new Ruggero, deploys a confident tenor, warm at the top, with considerable refinement. His acting, though generalised, still fittingly catches the youth’s naivety and passion and complements Magda’s greater reticence.Gail Pearson lights into the role of Lisette with wicked relish, her gleaming soprano only occasionally edgy in alt. Alan Oke lavishes wit and verve on the preening Prunier, singing off words with security and sweetness of tone. Peter Savidge’s Rambaldo touchingly entreats Magda to return to him (Act III).Richard Farnes conducts a reading of the airy and graceful score which combines exuberance and sensitivity. Catch this stylish revival.

The multi-coloured costumes for Tatyana’s nameday party are garish. Poor Ryland Davies looks like a 19th-century Quentin Crisp as Monsieur Triquet. Visually the role is a borderline anti-gay stereotype, though being the trouper he is Davies nearly salvages it with his touching singing.But in this crucial scene too Pimlott fails to define the emotional tensions among the central characters that lead to the calamity of the fatal duel. Throughout there’s a sense of individual performers doing their best while the bigger picture lacks integrity.Amanda Roocroft just about gets away with her rather mature Tatyana, though her high notes are clouded. But she’s vulnerable and truthful in her acting. In the title role, Dmitri Hvorostovsky is vocally superb and dramatically authoritative, while Rolando Villazon’s Lensky delivers some inspired singing, if not consistently so. Eric Halfvarson makes Prince Gremin’s single scene memorable, and Nino Surguladze provides an appealing Olga.In the pit Philippe Jordan’s stop-go conducting inhibits the lyrical flow of the score, which should provide one of the most moving of operatic experiences.

Tony Burke’s scaled-down version for English Touring Opera (Michael Rosewell conducts) never blunts the drama that way, although there is some loss of textural variety and dynamic range. More problematic is the text, presented in the translation by Otakar Kraus and Edward Downes.Amanda Echalaz’s Jenufa has all the notes yet, without the assistance of surtitles, few words are audible. The character’s simple warmth also fails to register, the voice better at conveying anxiety. Her prayer to the Virgin is simply too loud. Vocally, even physically, she seems insufficiently differentiated from her stepmother, the austere Kostelnika.Anne Mason may sound unlovely in that role but she dominates the stage with a compelling mix of stiff formality and desperate emotion. Strikingly lit by Aideen Malone, Act 2’s denouement, as the Kostelnika imagines Death peering into her house, is riveting, helped by the revelation of a window-shaped hole behind the icon of the Holy Mother. Dwayne Jones’ physically bulky Laca brings fine diction to an awkward part.At one with James Conway’s unfussy direction, Michael Vale’s sets avoid gratuitous innovation. Act 1 is played with a static black millwheel centre stage left and three white columns downstage right. A few chairs in Act 3 suggest the imminence of wedding guests. Costumes favour toning browns and greys. The final image, of Jenufa and Laca moving upstage into sunlight and a better life, works superbly.

For its debut production it has chosen the third of American Tobias Picker’s four operas, premiered in Dallas in 2001.A retelling of Zola’s novel of 1867, Gene Scheer’s wordy libretto relates how lovers Therese and Laurent murder Therese’s dreary husband Camille but are then haunted by guilt and the presence in their home of Camille’s paralysed mother, who overhears their conversation and tries to reveal their crime. But it is their own despair that finally leads them to suicide.It’s a dark story with some operatic potential but there is neither enough variety nor enough definition of character in Picker’s score, heard here in his own reduced version. Too much of it passes by anonymously without registering as a vital expression of the drama.But the company tackle it boldly, even if Lee Blakeley’s direction itself needs stronger definition. Emma Wee’s designs evoke effectively the stifling Parisian environment, and there are committed performances in the central roles from Isabelle Cals as a nervy Therese, Colin Judson as the feeble Camille, Carole Wilson as his omni-present mother and especially Nicholas Garrett, who gives Laurent some moody glamour.The orchestra sounds tentative but conductor Timothy Redmond shows spirit.

But English Touring Opera’s scaled-down band of around 30 players under Noel Davies delivers richness as well as thrilling transparency and touching intimacy to boot. It’s worth catching this production at one of its 16 locations between now and the end of May for this alone.The singing, in Edmund Tracey’s English translation, is also more than respectable, though with some reservations. Michael Bracegirdle (starting his run early as the second-cast Cavaradossi, owing to Sean Ruane’s indisposition) has the right Italianate penetration but not the lyricism to bring off the role. He gives his all in his Act 3 letter aria but takes a while to warm up in Act 1, especially dramatically, making us forget that, like Tosca, he is also a headstrong Italian artist. Vocally, Julie Unwin’s Tosca is highly appealing and she sings her Vissi d’arte with poise and tonal colour, yet otherwise seems unseized by the role, whether attempting jealousy and coquettishness at the church, or urgent instruction to Cavaradossi on how to play dead at his planned mock execution.Craig Smith (Scarpia) has to work hard to assert his vocal weight initially but convincingly masks his grand-manipulation of Tosca beneath a gloss of social dignity. Trinidad-born tenor Ronal Samm lends his imposing figure, robust tone and dagger-sharp text-delivery to the role of Scarpia’s henchman Spoletta.Michael Vale’s minimalist set – a series of six foot-high mottled grey panels with a ladder leading to an upper level – may be little more than practical, though its two-level possibilities are well exploited.

For starters there are Alice Purcell’s ugly pastel settings, the inexplicably graffiti-laden flats in Act I and the doggedly unfunny large canine artefacts cluttering up Acts II and III. Giuseppe Di Iorio’s lighting is bright and ordinary.Gawn’s approach is puerile ‘giocoso’ wholly without ‘dramma’. She dispenses with the social distinctions so crucial to the characters’ motivations, opting instead for crude mugging, cheap laughs and peculiar gestural semaphore. She renders Mozart’s masterpiece a limp TV sitcom.There are legion ludicrous moments – the betrothal chorus mugging grotesquely (Act I), Susanna trying to crawl unseen across the Countess’ bed when she could easily walk round it, the Count improbably trying to strangle his wife (Act II) and fainting on discovering Figaro’s parentage (Act III).Gawn’s grasp of character is tenuous. Howard Reddy’s Count is a blustering booby lacking gravitas, whose jealousy lacks credibility. Julianne Young’s Cherubino is more Popo the Puppett than priapic adolescent. The Countess is a cipher with an almost permanently pained expression.Three performances transcend the perfunctory direction to fashion three-dimensional portraits. Jeni Bern is a pure-toned, feisty Susanna, not always clear of diction. Wyn Pencarreg’s Figaro, sung with warm centred tone and a subtle regard for words, exudes danger and charm. Harry Nicoll’s time-serving Basilio is a burnished gem.Conductor Christian Gansch brings brio and gaiety to the score.

In a war-torn once-luxury hotel, atmospherically designed by Vicki Mortimer, Jephtha rallies his citizen army and defeats the enemy but at agonising cost – the possible execution of his beloved daughter.There are striking performances from Mark Padmore as the charismatic leader and Susan Bickley as his wife Storge, reprising their original roles. Making WNO debuts are Fflur Wyn, intensely moving as the dutiful Iphis, and counter tenor Iestyn Davies sensitively matching her as Hamor, the would-be groom. Strong support is given by Neal Davies as Zebul, Jephtha’s half brother and right-hand man.As the ever-present angelic-winged deus ex machina, who engineers a possibly happier outcome than the Bible suggests, Charlotte Ellett is both authoritative and serenely compelling.The almost continuous movement of the individualised and powerful chorus, as directed by Struan Leslie, is an outstanding feature of this staging, so enhanced by chorus master Donald Nally’s conducting of the on-form orchestra.The only reservation regarding this co-production with English National Opera is that it is sung in English, which means that most of the words are lost. A synopsis and complete text in the programme is simply not enough. The fine surtitle facility should be employed and the sooner the better.

Apollo now falls for Hyacinth’s sister, Melia, and it is a jealous rival to Apollo, Zephyrus, who kills Hyacinth and blames the god.Mozart’s score deftly integrates existing musical styles to forge a wholly individual voice. The narrative moves fleetly, propelled by a rhythmic elan underpinning emotionally charged arias. His ear for orchestral colour is already well developed.Highlights include a duet which excitingly combines Melia’s rage and Apollo’s pleas for calm, Oebalus’ moving lament for his dead son and the ravishing father/daughter duet warmed by pizzicato strings, muted violins, divided violas, and horns, whose harmonies and gentle tread prefigure Susanna’s rapt ‘Deh vieni’. Magic.Ian Page conducted a sprightly reading, which naturally made way for more tender moments, while a strong cast shaped the sometimes demanding vocal lines with assurance and sensitivity, notably Mark Le Brocq’s caring Oebalus and Rebecca Bottone’s sparky Melia, though she can sound shrill in alt. William Purefoy was the pure-toned, dignified Apollo.Sadly, Annelise Miskimmon’s crass staging rendered Mozart’s miniature masterpiece about redemption and reconciliation an infantile comedy, the teenage Mozart – an irritating cherub – perpetually popping up carrying 2-D props or leering at characters, thus subverting the drama. Predictable gales of inane, braying laughter followed fast.

The composer fashioned the libretto from Shakespeare’s Merry Wives, interspersed with other contemporary material, retaining the focus upon community and social interaction. Falstaff is ‘primus into pares’ within a rural, bourgeois world.The rollicking score skilfully fuses folk material with a broader harmonic palette. There are impassioned declarations for Anne Page and Fenton, waggish chamber-like music for the Mistresses Page, Ford and Quickly, comic outbursts for Ford and brief characteristic utterances for supporting citizenry. Oleg Caetani conducts a warmly ebullient reading, the orchestra savouring every moment.John Gunter’s versatile trucked Tudor house frames, set in front of a silhouette of Windsor castle, Nigel Levings’ evocative lighting and Tim Goodchild’s colourful Edwardian costumes all created scenes perfectly for Judge’s rumbustious, wise and witty staging, packed with meaningful detail. I loved the discreet cow-pat joke.In the tradition of his fine RSC productions of Shakespeare’s comedies, Judge elicits subtly nuanced, interactive characterisations from a cast of superlative British singers, some scandalously neglected by ENO in recent years.Where to begin? There’s Sally Burgess’ conniving Quickly, Jean Rigby’s and Marie McLaughlin’s sly scheming wives, Russell Smythe’s benign Page and Stuart Kale’s bustling Shallow.Andrew Shore’s inimitable Falstaff unsettles the social epicentre. As Brook, Alastair Miles’ uptight Ford explodes like Peter Cook on speed. Andrew Kennedy and Sarah Fox are romantic yet practical lovers. Invidiously, among lesser roles incisively played, I enjoyed Iain Patterson’s Welsh parson and Richard Coxon’s sweet-natured Simple.

In Stefanos Lazaridis’ set, only a small corner of the stage is given over to the grubby domestic setting of Marie and her ever-present son, while the grimy white tiles of the main part focus on the anti-hero Wozzeck as little more than a social experiment, taunted by the doctor and captain. At the end of the opera – his madness complete, and having killed Marie in jealousy – Wozzeck drowns himself in a tank of water, joining three other specimen cases. It’s a theatrical coup, only spoiled by our own inquisitiveness as to how the fully submerged bass-baritone Johan Reuter doesn’t drown (answer: he has a hidden breathing pipe).A huge mirror at the rear of the stage reflects overview images from Wozzeck’s troubled mind, effecting a continuum between thought and reality. The haunting voices at the opera’s close, chattering of Marie’s death, emerge from speakers around the auditorium. Strokes like these abound, genuinely contributing to the sense of a richly dimensional theatre.But other aspects do not work as well, among them the zombie-like revellers of Act II’s fourth scene, and Wozzeck’s all-too gutless and helpless childishness.The roles are roundly well sung and energetically propelled. Susan Bullock is an affecting Marie and Jorma Silvasti’s brutal drum major is vividly painted. Graham Clark is gripping as captain, himself teetering on the edge of insanity. Harding has a long-held passion for this work and it shows in his conducting.If occasionally it seems there’s too much going on, which distracts from individual psychological exploration, Warner’s production is nevertheless imaginatively conceived and well worth experiencing.

But, despite her occasionally contorted vowels, her exchange of arias and the following duet with Victor Ryan Robertson’s Rodolfo make for an impassioned Act 1 climax.Act Two brings Café Momus – and it’s showtime. The streets bustle with Parisian life, a strongman entertains children, sailors are on the pull and a suite of elegant roller-skating waiters are busying themselves with the customers. It is here that Zambello best exploits the added dimension of this stage, though the heavy multilayering of activity means there’s almost too much going on.Victor Ryan Robertson, as Rodolfo is suitably heroic, able to scale the heights and sustain his phrases without it ever sounding too difficult. His Mimi – Anne Sophie Duprels – sounds heavier than ideal, but creamy toned, though her character could do with more definition. Majella Cullagh’s feisty Musetta is well drawn, matching her character with the odd kick of vocal unsophistication. Richard Burkhard’s bright-sounding Shaunard licks Dean Robinson’s slightly plummy Colline, and Henry Waddingon doubles to strong effect as the roving landlord Benoit and as Alcindoro, Musetta’s latest sugar-daddy.Inevitably, the loss of sightlines between conductor and singers quashes some expressive freedom, but the RPO plays well under David Parry.

There’s repeated hand-washing in an effort to assuage the Macbeths’ guilt and in Act 4 the Scottish refugees articulate their suffering within their bedroom, perhaps inhabiting their guilty dreams.The witches’ agency in the proceedings is played up – one delivers Macbeth’s letter in Act 1, another engineers the escape of Banquo’s son, foiling the planned twin assassination – as is Lloyd’s motif of the gold cage. The golden cavalcade-in-miniature which pre-empts the full-sized version of the king’s arrival is plain disconcerting from a theatrical view.Conducting the later version of 1865 – by which time Verdi’s musical frames of reference had somewhat broadened – Yakov Kreizberg leads a very fine cast. Violeta Urmana’s unshaking ambition is as clear in vocal as in dramatic terms, while Thomas Hampson’s slower-burning Macbeth lingers more on individual words, clothing them in colour. John Relyea’s richly wrought Banquo leads one to lament his character is killed off so early on and there’s a sensational ringing quality to Maltese tenor Joseph Calleja’s Macduff. The occasionally scrappy ensemble and blending of the female chorus was the only vocal disappointment on the second-night performance.There are times when you wish Verdi had waited for his wider musical arsenal to develop before tackling such a brutal scenario but the quality and dramatic focus of the key singers here far outweigh the disadvantages.

In this he is well matched by the sensitive and thrilling Senta of Annalena Persson, and strongly supported by Ian Storey as Erik and Gidon Saks as Daland, with Peter Wedd as Steersman and Mary Lloyd-Davies as Mary. The orchestra is in top-class form and is conducted by Carlo Rizzi, with the chorus at its rousing best under Donald Nally.Unfortunately for this sparse and comparatively straightforward musical drama of sea, storm and superstition leading to redemption through love, director David Pountney chooses to overload and obscure it with stage effects beyond all reason. In a setting of steel scaffolding, restless screens and wandering walls and doors designed by Robert Innes Hopkins, moments of stillness and character interaction are rare, furniture is trundled off and on unnecessarily, puzzling symbols abound and action is surreal. The screens show almost constant video and film by sisters Jane and Louise Wilson – space training sites, catalogues of house interiors, still photos of principals, huge piercing eyes and much more, always distracting attention from the singers. All this in drab costumes, except for a score of blonde teenage bimbos who become victims of a brutal mass rape by the astronauts. Musically it’s a triumph but for the rest a pretentious mess.The Flying Dutchman, a co-production with Zurich Opera, is sung in German with English surtitles (plus Welsh in Cardiff and Swansea), the three scenes being played without interval.

The updating from Renaissance Mantua to 1950s Manhattan mafia promises to preserve a sense of the Duke’s fearful autocracy, but this is where the production falls down.In this 11th revival directed by Elaine Tyler-Hall, there is little sense of mobster rule. (How scared can you be of a Teddy Boy re-named the ‘Duke’ anyway?). Rigoletto, the Duke’s jester, is a smooth barman servicing the evening-dressed courtiers. His hunchback amounts to little more than a stiffness down one side, with the almost tragically untragic result that he sometimes hobbles around like Batman’s adversary The Penguin. But for the rest, the dark-alley setting of Rigoletto’s rundown apartment and the Edward Hopper-style bar of Act 3 are heavily atmospheric.Peter Auty’s Duke may not have the ideal Italianate ring but it lacks nothing in gusto, while Brindley Sherratt’s hitman Sparafucile is granite-cool yet rich-toned. In the title-role Alan Opie may occasionally strain at the top but he paints a true and complex picture of his character’s private fears and struggles. Judith Howath sings his all-but-cloistered daughter Gilda with great facility and modesty – as winning in her entreaty to her father to reveal more of his past as in her heart-fluttering musings on the disguised Duke who has captured her heart. Given the thrilling climax we experience at Gilda’s death, it is a shame Rigoletto’s realisation of his ironic part in it does not hit home more strongly. But there are certainly elements of the classic stamped on this production, and even if Alexander Briger makes a welcome, if not exceptional, conducting debut for the company, the cast is practically first-rate.

The staging has the unmistakeable look of a classic. The direction offers moment-to-moment insights into life in the Almaviva household, whether we are watching the central characters in action or the small army of servants following their every move with fascinated scrutiny. Tanya McCallin’s elegant sets and Paule Constable’s atmospheric lighting add to its visual appeal.Every one of the main players is excellent. The young American bass-baritone Kyle Ketelsen is the liveliest and most human of Figaros, ably seconded by the pinpoint precision and delectable personality of Isabel Bayrakdarian’s Susanna. Michael Volle’s Count looks constantly harassed as his schemes are outwitted, while Soile Isokoski sings a Countess of unusual dignity and intelligence. Her two arias are highpoints.Sophie Koch’s Cherubino is no less complete, combining the demeanour of a high-spirited adolescent male with the vocalism of a stylish mezzo. Among the smaller roles, John Graham-Hall’s brilliant Basilio, Jeremy White’s clearly drawn Antonio and Harry Nicoll’s un-parodied Don Curzio all register positively.Colin Davis’s conducting has its idiosyncratic moments but in overview he delivers a reading of warmth and fluidity.

But Ko-Ko gets his biggest laugh when he says that ENO’s recently departed chairman, Martin Smith won’t be missed either. There is some cheering at this point.Since Suart changes the names regularly, they may well be different at the next show. But what won’t alter is the sheer quality and panache of his performance, which is a brilliantly sustained comic turn.He is aided and abetted by Felicity Palmer’s grandly sung, self-satirising Katisha, Sarah Tynan’s precise and knowing Yum-Yum and Keith Jameson’s neat and debonair Nanki-Poo. Richard Angas’s Mikado remains an amiably terrifying assumption, and there are able and alert readings of Pooh-Bah from Ian Caddy and Pish-Tush from Toby Stafford-Allen.David Ritch returns to revive Jonathan Miller’s production, which once again induces near ecstasy among the audience.The dialogue is brighter and punchier than for some time, the dancing never misses the beat (well, hardly ever) and both Stefanos Lazaridis’s sets and Sue Blane’s costumes look as good as ever. Given the verve with which the company deliver this classic staging, it could easily go on for another twenty years.Conductor Simon Lee picks tempos with care and sends the scintillating score tripping gaily over the footlights.

Essential Scottish Opera is the company’s annual jaunt around Scotland’s smaller halls with four soloists, one pianist, a few minor costume changes and a low-key attitude to staging.Yet with Derek Clark’s inspired choice of music and inventive, fluid direction from Dafydd Burne-Jones, there is nothing peripheral about the concept at all. It could even be the backbone of a successful opera strategy. For opera lovers it is a chance to hear new and varied works. For interested newcomers, it provides a glimpse of what all the fuss is about.Musical choice is critical. Too many hits and it would become no more than a tasty snack, the operatic equivalent of tapas. But this programme, building from the familiarities of Mozart and Bizet through less well-known Handel, Purcell and Tchaikovsky to surprises from Adolphe Adam, downright modernity from Judith Weir and a cheeky encore from Noel Coward, is the equivalent of the tasting menu in a Michelin starred restaurant – without the expense. Presentation is vital, of course. Baritone Paul Carey Jones allows his voice to hint at its full power – in the confines of a 360 seat auditorium.Soprano Edel Shannon provides glimpses of beautifully realised vocal runs and superb non-vocal creation of character. Mezzo-soprano Julia Riley and tenor Alexander Grove find wonderfully expressive depths to their vocal interpretations. Ian Shaw’s piano is constant but unintrusive. All told, a satisfyingly delectable treat.

In the latest revival of Richard Eyre’s 12-year-old production, directed by Patrick Young, these are not always successful. Though Ana Maria Martinez’s Violetta and her Alfredo (American tenor Charles Castronovo) gel well together – and there’s no shortage of ardour in their singing – the latter seems far from entranced at their first meeting.Dramatically less satisfying is the first scene of Act II, where Alfredo’s father Giorgio, here sung by Serbian Zeljko Lucíc, convinces the reformed courtesan Violetta to renounce Alfredo’s love for the sake of the family’s reputation. Lucíc presents a two-dimensional character, with little appreciation that Violetta’s sacrifice exposes his hypocrisy. If the Serbian bass’s tone is appealing enough, Castronovo’s smoothly lyrical Alfredo is by turns heroic and passionately tender.Bob Crowley’s sets are, for the outer acts, lavish if fading in glory and Violetta’s apartment in Act I is packed tightly with party-goers who are barely able to move. Here, too, the exaggeratedly inclined ceiling – designed to reveal an upper cylindrical dome – gives a warped perspective.The highlight is Martinez’s strikingly non-shrinking Violetta, perhaps not richly layered in colouring but powerfully steadfast and lacking nothing in honour or purpose. The attempt in the final scene to convey the grisly realism of her consumptive condition deepens her plight.Philippe Auguin sometimes allows Verdi’s longer lines to sag but otherwise draws vibrant playing from the Royal Opera Orchestra.

And with good reason. Though the plot – concerning the fortunes in love of the proprietor and manager of the perfume plantation on the Philippine island of Florodora – is distinctly slender, and some of the jokes hoary, there is enough wit and charm in the best material to demonstrate why Leslie Stuart’s score was once an enormous hit in London and New York.The first act drags a little, but momentum gathers with the second, which is stuffed with good numbers, including the famous ‘Tell me, pretty maiden’. Described as a concert performance, the show offers more. Though the cast hold on to scores and scripts, they know how to put over the dialogue and work hard to create some pretty unlikely characters.Rosemary Ashe’s Lady Holyrood, ‘a penniless lady of title’, is a tour de force, equalled by Simon Butteriss’s expertly delivered Anthony Tweedlepunch, a brilliantly sustained comic turn. Not far behind is David O’Brien’s Cyrus W. Gilfain, the American perfume magnate, while Garrie Harvey, as the dashing Captain Donegal, makes a showstopper out of ‘A Military Man’.Conductor Timothy Henty, in charge of an orchestra of five that plays his arrangements enthusiastically, presides over the music with a real sense of brio.

It is his version which returns, and while it certainly makes the comic element more immediate than in Czech, there is a distinct twang of W. S. Gilbert to it, which jars with the rustic Czech content.Much of the marriage brokers Kecal’s description of potential groom-to be Vasek, though, is inspired.It is a show full of colour (with yellow and green lit backdrops whose intensity would thrill even Anish Kapoor) and joy, with cheery harvest preparations by the villagers opening Act 1 and rowdy macho games at the inn opening Act 2. The circus divertissement is sumptuously and meticulously staged and includes some very cute and confident performances from the troupe’s younger members.Given that the lovers Marenka (Susan Gritton) and Jenik (Simon O’Neill in his House debut) are apart for much of the opera, their chemistry is not convincing enough and Gritton looked awkward in her trousers-and-shirt costume. She sings with great expression and O’Neill’s ability to soar at the top of his range is so effortless as to almost tire the listener. Peter Rose sings a perfectly judged Kecal, inflated with self-importance, but not over-caricatured and Timothy Robinson makes a poignantly timid, stammering Vasek. Under Charles Mackerras, 80 years young, the Royal Opera orchestra plays with fizz and the occasional required touch of roughness.

John Fulljames and his designers distilled its magic enchantingly. Soutra Gilmour dotted the Town Hall stage with trees lit by Bruno Poet in soft greens and blues.Orchestral instruments imaginatively defined the various locales – a double bass as a sofa, brooms hung as tubular bells for the home, weighted balloons at different heights signifying the sweetmeats of the Witch’s house, a timpani her cauldron. However, the children berry-picking on bikes through the forest became tiresomely repetitive.Fulljames concentrated the action, seamlessly choreographed, upon a forestage, thus enabling the singers clearly to put across words, comfortably to ride Humperdinck’s rich, albeit exquisitely judged, orchestration, which Richard Farnes and the orchestra realised in an urgent, tender, rhythmically alert reading.Fulljames deftly etched the family’s poverty via their drab clothes, Hansel’s and Gretel’s unusually edgy, if innately warm, relationship, the MacMeal of their forest dream – chips, burgers, coke, ketchup, the works. The excellent principals responded with subtly nuanced performances.They also warmly shaped Humperdinck’s rewarding vocal lines, sang out with full tone and crisply put across David Pountney’s pointed translation, Peter Hoare’s sprightly Jack-in-the-Box Witch excepted – he was sparing of the consonants.Julianne Young and Jeni Bern (looking a mite too healthy?) unfussily established the genuine affection underlying the sibling’s sometimes aggressive squabbling, Sarah Pring the innate goodness underlying the Mother’s angry frustration.

Their once  pointed, pared-down productions, which drove deep to the hearts of scores, latterly have evolved into charmless camp charades – witness the ROH’s new Barbiere.They posit a travelling commedia company improvising the piece on the hoof. So Christian Fenouillat provides a cavernous booth-stage setting, which rises and tilts to press home the characters’ confusions during the Act I finale. An itinerant company’s stage it ain’t.Furniture and props are minimal, so no inkwell or laundry basket to underpin the tell-tale ink-stain on Rosina’s finger and her swapping the laundry list for the love letter.The chorus wears commedia masks. Bartolo, Basilio and Berta sport funny noses and Count Almaviva a mask for his mirthless music master impersonation – his red toy-town suit signifies zilch. Berta resembles a pantomime dame, Figaro a Noddy in dungarees. Heart-shaped pink balloons cheapen the opera’s finale.Sparkling performances and fine singing might have neutralised the production’s empty shenanigans. Alas, only the seasoned Bruno Practico’s pear-shaped Bartolo, Joyce DiDonato’s pert Rosina and Elizabeth Gale’s tippling Berta round out character and, after uncertain starts, sing with style and assurance.George Petean’s Figaro bellows and bustles about. Raymond Aceto fields a gravelly bass and hams Basilio. The over-parted, uncharismatic Almaviva consistently pushes his blanched tenor into ugliness.Happily, Mark Elder conducts a tight, rhythmically alert reading of the fizzing score, though there were first-night orchestral lapses. Predictably, the audience loved the pantomime antics. So much for Rossini’s acerbic social comment.

Though Neil Armfield’s staging has its share of half-naked torsos, significant gestures and agonised moments of surfacing repression, it unfolds the narrative with stark clarity and brings imaginative intensity to the big moments – the battle, Squeak’s treachery, Billy’s hanging.Designer Brian Thomson provides a black enclave, subtly lit by Nigel Levings, with a sky-scape drop-curtain to the rear and trucked steps to access a moving platform on hydraulics, which tilts and turns, rises and falls to establish locale. It is evocative, but would that the movement occasionally let up.Musically the evening is a triumph. David Litton’s dynamic reading is frequently revelatory. He unveils a wealth of significant detail, finely integrates tempos so that key passages explode with a verbal urgency. Only occasionally does he sacrifice a right balance between pit and stage to visceral orchestral excitement.I doubt I will ever see a better Billy. Simon Keenlyside subtly colours his noble baritone, weds a lithe athleticism to dramatic flair to forge a searingly truthful portrait of innocence betrayed. The scene in the darbies is heart-breaking.John Tomlinson, still a vocal titan, is the hollowed-eyed, brooding Claggart, Timothy Robinson an introverted Captain Vere, his full-toned tenor bringing a welcome robustness to the role. Adrian Thompson and Gwynne Howell excel as Red Whiskers and Dansker.James Edward’s victimised Novice is truly touching and William Berger is moving as his friend. Both field bright, promising tenors. Productions like this Budd should have been the norm during Sean Doran’s late stewardship.

They are aided by the madcap Papageno, also in search of love and abetted by the mysterious Queen of the Night and the rather villainous, Monostatos.Pocket Opera’s production is aimed particularly for children and as such incorporates many traditional pantomime values in an story admirably suited for such an adaptation. Annabel Lee design features a fantastic amount of UV puppetry which a great fun for the kids including menacing snakes, flying rockets and schools of fish in the sea. The story lends itself perfectly to the hiss-the-villain style but there should have been a good deal more adaptation in order to create an engaging children’s show. The score remains relatively in tact and although competently sung in English, there is little in opera that lends itself to sing-a-long for young children. The audience participation suffered for this reason and the pace drags a little.The performances were bold and brassy with a genial Giles Davies entertaining as the friendly Papageno and David Vivian Russell switches between the evil role of Monostatos and Third Lady with equally frightening results.

Staging does not necessarily enhance them, Peter Sellar’s extraordinary version of Theodora excepted. Winton Dean insists Saul “demands the stage for its full effect” but Opera North’s semi-staging disappointed on several counts.First, Leeds Town Hall’s cavernous acoustic may suit Tristan or Nabucco but Saul’s crystalline instrumentation, though conceived on an unusually grand scale, failed to impact despite Christian Curnyn’s shapely reading, characterised by aptly integrated tempos and a finely-judged balance.Second, the chorus in Saul is the prime mover and commentator. Opera North’s chorus, dressed in black with scores in hand, was kept firmly seated, though it sang with firm attack and impassioned involvement. Director John Fulljames often distracted from its searing contributions by upstaging it with irrelevant movement.Finally, Fulljames – whose Buxton productions have evidenced little true grasp of stagecraft – crassly choreographed the principals. When they were not tripping up and down stairs, they mostly overacted on a raised stage behind the orchestra, which forced them vocally to project through a wall of sound. Words, here rather important, were inaudible.And yet there was a forestage, which Fulljames rarely used except for the final quarter hour. Given much coarse acting, that was perhaps a blessing.There were a few compensating vocal pleasures. Mark Wilde’s Jonathan fielded a clear, full tenor and crisp diction, as did Mark Le Brocq’s High Priest. Tim Mead’s countertenor David impressed, though the top can get hooty. Lucy Crowe sang sweetly but wordlessly as Michal.

What could be more tragic than the back story of the eponymous Marchioness Violante, who still loves Count Belfiore – the jealous lover who stabbed her a year before the opera starts – and goes in search of him disguised as a gardener?In James Ramster’s production we see her stabbing during the overture, and her transformation from noblewoman to worker at the hands of an ever-resourceful sextuplicate of footmen-cum-stagehands. The period costumes are offset effectively by a minimal staging, comprising two sets of garden steps, each formed in two parts, offering multiple arrangements, and a few bushes. The plain-screen backdrop is effective but prone to rather too many colour changes.In this aria-heavy opera, the cast naturally have a hard time keeping the action going, but there is much fine singing. Only Michael McBride’s Mayor seemed to lack refinement and power, especially earlier on. The more dramatic sopranos Claire Watkins (Arminda) and Catherine Hopper (Ramiro) are balanced by the more lyric Kishani Jayasinghe (Sandrina, the Marchioness’ assumed name) and Fflur Wyn (Serpetta). Especially noteworthy in this ‘second’ casting are Ronan Collett’s smoothly voiced Nardo (baritone) and Allan Clayton’s well-supported but never tired or tiring Belfiore (tenor).In the pit the Royal Academy Sinfonia plays with considerable punch and style, under Iain Ledingham (though he occasionally whips them into too much of a frenzy), who also strongly flavours the music with bracing harpsichord-continuo playing.

Ancient Persia is swapped for an 18th-century English pleasure-garden setting – presided over by Roubilliac’s statue of Handel, commissioned for the Vauxhall Gardens.The courtiers, dressed and made up in grey are themselves semi-animate sculpture-spectators. The green deckchairs offset a range of objets which could equally be palace treasures or unusual garden ornaments. Xerxes’ new bridge over the Hellespont to Greece is also wheeled on and admired as a museum exhibit.Despite the opera’s comic vein, passions are strong. They particularly take hold in Act 2, with a series of arias spanning love, jealousy and anguish, precipitated by Atalanta, the wildcard sister of Romilda (the object of Xerxes’ affections).Katarina Karnéus is a potent Xerxes, at first, its seems, strongest in her lower range, but faultlessly opening out at the top when the opportunities arise. As Arsamenes, Xerxes’ brother and rival in love, Lawrence Zazzo proves himself to be one of the most beguiling counter-tenors around, with an unusually even range and barely a lost word. Sarah Tynan’s agile, youthful Atalanta is rapturously sung, her machinations hidden – even from herself – by carefree naivety.Noel Davies turns the ENO orchestra into a sensitive and stylish period-informed ensemble, deftly underlining Handel’s expression of wide ranging moods and emotions.

Perhaps we are invited to project our own dreamlike images on to this bare night canvas, but if so, we are forced to compete with distracting video projections  slow-motion images of – water droplets, an owl flying.The contemporary feel carries through to the lovers, frocked and suited, whom Theseus seats at a theatre while the opera’s overture is playing. Soon the first touch of magic arrives with the Fairies’ chorus, the Tiffin Boys’ Choir offsetting their white pyjama suits with blue glowballs. The true magic lies, though, with Jami Reid-Quarrell’s Puck – an acrobatic aerialist who climbs a suspended rope and darts around with physical eloquence and knowing mischief.The rude mechanicals (or rustics, as Britten referred to them) present themselves as a group of unlikely luvvies, producing a hilarious Pyramus and Thisbie in the last act, largely thanks to Andrew Sritheran’s Snout/Wall and Andrew Kennedy’s high-heeled, frock-busting Flute/Thisbe.William Towers (Oberon) may not be as vocally arresting as his colleagues and dynamic as they were on stage, the Tiffin Boys’ words needed clearer articulation. From an otherwise outstanding cast, highlights are Gillian Keith’s forthright and Kate Bush-esque Titania, Grant Doyle’s golden-voiced Demetrius and Tove Dahlberg’s cleanly sculpted Hermia.

His cast, drawn from the RCM’s Opera School, shows remarkable resilience and concentration on stage, in what is a snappy and demanding work, whose extensive dialogue can easily trip singers up between the sung numbers.The principal characters in this ‘second’ casting are of consistently high standard. Joe Roche sings Eisenstein with a brilliant, ringing clarity, though occasionally becomes unstuck when singing loudly at the top of his range. The glamorous, sharply-bobbed Pumeza Matshikiza as his wife Rosalinde maintains an air of moral superiority despite her own philandering. She steals the show at the Act II ball, equally comfortable in entertaining the guests while either reclining upon or dancing atop a grand piano.Perhaps it is Eliana Pretorian’s Adele that steals the show overall. She inhabits her feisty, flirtatious femme-fatalish character with complete naturalness, yet her vocal agility is impressive. As Prince Orlovsky, whose ball everyone is dying to attend, Patricia Helen Orr’s rich, centred mezzo lacks nothing in character. And Andrew Conley’s Dr Falke is a marvel of physical co-ordination put to the service of comic expression. His Act I duet with Eisenstein is a no-holds-barred, music-hall saluting hoot. Other RCM students had a chance to shine during the ball, too, with a jazzy violin and guitar duo and a Jerome Kern medley.The RCM Opera Orchestra, under Michael Rosewell, played with alertness after a ragged overture but lacked in panache what it possessed in energy. Regardless, this is a fine team effort, brilliantly executed, and another feather in the RCM’s operatic cap.

Caringly judged dynamics assist singers to mould and give meaning to vocal lines. Ballo’s novel and exhilarating blend of comedy and tragedy is held in perfect balance. Marvellous!Sadly, the revival of Mario Martone’s botched staging fails to live up to Sir Charles’ visionary conducting. Martone updates the Boston version, never satisfactory, to the Civil War period, though no one would guess from Sergio Tramonti’s disparate settings, ranging from the skimpy to the emptily spectacular.Stagecraft is primitive, as in the opening scene of Act III. Where it takes place is uncertain, the cast often handle props without motivation, while furniture-shifting flunkies disrupt the concluding quintet.The excellent cast is left to create character on the hoof. Result? Dmitri Hvorostovsky’s Renato crudely chews the scenery during ‘Eri tu’ and thereafter, Robert Gleadow hams it as the conspirator Samuel. Stephanie Blythe, singing superbly, barely rescues Ulrica from the nondescript. Patrizia Biccire can do little with the page Oscar.However, Richard Margison and Nina Stemme bring a third dimension to Riccardo and Amelia. And all the principals sing Verdi’s soaring melodies with firm centred tone and warm phrasing. Musically the evening is a triumph.

Ahead of next year’s Mozart anniversary the GSMD dusts down this novelty with some degree of success.While the GSMD opera orchestra, under the sprightly baton of Nicholas Kok, couldn’t hide Mozart’s as yet undeveloped harmonic language  – and therefore the restricted emotional range of the music and characterisation – it played with stylish vim, notwithstanding the occasional lack of precision and the odd tuning disagreement between winds and strings.The plot details the shenanigans of the Hungarian captain Fracasso and his sergeant Simone as they try to dupe the unyielding Don Cassandro into allowing them to marry the Don’s sister and maid respectively. To confuse things a little, Fracasso’s wily sister Rosina aims to predispose the Don favourably towards the idea of the marriages by winning his heart, though she is herself pursued by Cassandro’s brother Polidoro. Polidoro is the true half-wit, while Rosina feigns a lack of intelligence designed to charm the Don.If the plot remains circuitous, Tom Rogers’s naïve two-dimensional designs – rich green lawn and hedges with a cut-out mansion facade to the rear, all framed by receding yellow arches – are effectively straightforward.On the whole the level of singing and acting is not high, though the Portuguese soprano Joana Seara stands out as the maid Ninetta (‘second’ casting) and Estonian tenor Oliver Kuusik gives a touching and humorous portrayal of a regressively childlike Polidoro.

Though described as a ‘tragic-sacred action’, Donizetti calls it an ‘oratorio’ in a letter to his father.Despite inconsistencies, it is pacy with dramatic confrontations aplenty to propel the composer’s oddball take on Noah and the Flood to a spectacular conclusion. The main action concerns Cadmo, his wife Sela and her close friend Ada, whose love for Cadmo causes her to accuse Sela of adultery with Noah’s son Jafet.Amongst the score’s many treasures are a superb sextet for Noah and his family (‘Oh Dio di pieta’), the exciting scena in which Ada betrays Sela to Cadmo, the Finale to Act I,  and Ada’s scena launching Act II – plenty of bel canto fireworks here.Sela’s desperate appeal to Cadmo to see her child echoes Cherubini’s Medea pleading to Creon for hers, while Noah’s noble ‘Dio tremendo, onnipossente’ unnervingly looks forward to Zaccaria’s leadership of the put-upon Hebrews in Verdi’s Nabucco (1842).Il Diluvio may not hang together as a drama, but it confirms the presence of a singular and individual voice on the operatic scene.Opera Rara’s cast did it proud, despite Drury Lane’s dry acoustic. Majella Cullagh’s spirited Sela traversed the staves with meaningful command, Manuela Custer smouldered dangerously as Ada, while Colin Lee imbued Cadmo with a manic edge. The young Mirco Palazzi was the impressive Noah. Giuliano Carella drew impassioned playing from the LPO.

It is probably the most sheerly beautiful staging I have ever encountered.Peter Mumford’s expressive, subtly evocative lighting is both prescient messenger of Butterfly’s fate and chronicler of the emotionally charged subtext. Michael Levine’s moving screens allow action to flow; his wide, rear up-curving floor space enables Anthony Minghella and Carolyn Choa to compose ravishing, emblematic stage pictures.Deftly handled Bunraku puppets represent Butterfly’s household, her child Sorrow, and the teenage geisha herself in a thought sequence accompanying the waiting Intermezzo (Act II, Part 2).In a recent Radio 4 interview, Anthony Minghella seemed to define his directing role as non-interventionist. Certainly, the treatment of the main protagonists is conventional, the odd telling detail excepted.It is the exceptional cast which provides any genuine insights: Alan Oke’s Goro, the professional marriage-broker, Jean Rigby’s concerned, warm-hearted and loyal Suzuki. Christopher Purves limns a sympathetic Sharpless. Sadly, the wooden Pinkerton belting out the music remains a total cipher.Mary Plazas’ Butterfly is extraordinary, the tiny figure disturbingly highlighting the story’s more perverse aspects. She judges superbly the delicate balance between resolve and vulnerability, never plays victim. Vocally, she husbands her resources skilfully never to compromise the power of the ‘spinto’ vocal lines.However the highly stylized, albeit ravishing, staging renders Butterfly a mere puppet, her exquisitely choreographed death exemplifying the triumph of image over emotion. It is as visually stunning as it is unmoving. David Parry conducts efficiently.

S. J. Perelman’s and Ogden Nash’s libretto may ramble outrageously, but its acid wit and sharp lyrics satirize social conformity, modern art and bourgeois values with an edge which still cuts.Weill’s score, a pungent fusion of Weimar and Broadway, effortlessly handles pastiche (the send-up ‘Way out West in Jersey’), Expressionist perversity (‘Dr Crippen’) and love songs touching and smoochy – ‘That’s Him’ and ‘Speak Low’. William Tuckett evocatively choreographs the ballet music, his faceless commuters and vision of blue collar bliss inducing an uneasy shudder.Tim Albery directs the unsettling odyssey of barber Rodney Hatch’s ecstatic entanglement with the goddess Venus with clarity and style. Antony McDonald’s settings and Emma Ryott’s costumes resonate with lashings of period atmosphere: Edward Hopper, Tin-Tin, Georgia O’Keefe, MGM musicals.The superb cast, having relaxed into their roles, now sing and act with an easeful and engaging confidence. Loren Geeting subtly coaxes sympathy for the geeky Rodney enmeshed by Karen Coker’s svelte, laid-back Venus. Ron Li-Paz’s sleek, self-regarding Savory and Christianne Tisdale’s wise-cracking secretary, Molly, are a hilarious double act.Eric Roberts show-steals as an inept private dick and a loopy psychiatrist. As Gloria Kramer, Rodney’s fianc?e, Jessica Walker defines ‘shrew’. Conductor James Holmes and the orchestra exuberantly reveal the many facets of Weill’s jewelled score. What a company, what a show!

How well does it stand up now that he is no longer with us?The score remains a wonderful thing, full of exuberant invention and dynamism. The heavily symbolic libretto has always had its detractors, and arguably Graham Vick’s production doesn’t play to its strengths. Paul Brown’s visuals lack variety and magic in a piece that needs a firm foundation in the English landscape for its celebration of some strange ancient rite. Ron Howell’s choreography for the crucial Ritual Dances looks cramped and gauche on this occasion.But several of the central performances redeem the faults. Amanda Roocroft makes a radiantly lyrical Jenifer. Will Hartmann is adequate as her fiancé Mark, lacking the brilliance and volume the part ideally requires. As the second pair of lovers, Cora Burggraaf and Gordon Gietz are finely matched to their roles and to each other.John Tomlinson is a tower of strength as Jenifer’s misguided father King Fisher, while Russian contralto Elena Manistina makes a commanding impression with Sosostris’s great aria.The chorus has a mixed evening, but conductor Richard Hickox gradually gets into his stride to deliver a fresh and punchy performance. It is not a piece that everyone warms to dramatically, but it is likely to remain one of the few British operas other than Britten’s to hold its own in the repertory.

As they meet, four Europeans sealing a deal with drug-trading jihadists are gunned down. In the confusion the couple escape with the money. Nick falls headlong for Nadine but it gradually becomes clear she is no innocent bystander.It takes a short while to get used to operatically trained voices using mics – and the orchestra, playing over click-track – but that is not the worst of it. John Lunn’s music, though it manages to conjure up the local colour, the bustle and the danger of Tangier, is tripped up by the dialogue and recitative-heavy libretto, leading to some awkwardly plain musical lines. Its pop and musical idiom wears thin after a while. There are, however, some entertaining set pieces – the beach babe trio’s Mr Mosquito dance, the chorus of Baywatch-type tourists and a lyrical song for the detective, sung by Omar Ebrahim.But Alison Chitty’s interlocking, revolving, wooden frames work extremely well and their bi-level, 24-like ability to accommodate two scenes simultaneously is picked up by a video screen, which shows, literally, an overview of Nick and Nadine in the hostel. Langridge uses the sliding panels and mobile stairs to create seamless scene changes.The singing and direction, along with Paul Pyant’s lighting, contribute to an impressively slick production, but the fast pace inevitably reduces the music to little more than a soundtrack. Ultimately it sounds like James Bond – the Musical, so if it is not opera, can it really be introducing opera to its target audience?

It will be interesting to see if this fine production will give Susannah some of the currency in Europe it has long enjoyed in the USA.The composer’s own libretto takes the familiar story from the Apocrypha about the chaste Susannah spied on when bathing naked in a stream by a group of lustful elders, and transposes it to an evangelical community in the Tennessee of the fifites. It is a tale of injustice and hypocrisy as Susannah is first condemned and then seduced by the Reverend Olin Blitch.The narrative is strongly handled by a composer who knows exactly how opera works. If the score has some less distinguished sections, Floyd taps cleverly into an American folk tradition and his music is never less than dramatically effective.That is certainly how it comes over in this show, though the score could do with a touch more precision under the baton of Christopher Larkin. Emily Pulley seizes the opportunities of the title role, with Stephen Kechulius masterly as her tormentor, Blitch. Glenn Alamilla is credible as young Little Bat and Simon O’Neill presents Susannah’s brother Sam with dignity. In Conor Murphy’s designs the period and milieu are nicely recreated and John Fulljames’ staging cannily draws parallels with today’s religious right.

Donizetti has regularly proved a fruitful quarry for Wexford to mine, and this latest revival certainly proves worthwhile.Maria di Rohan was the composer’s penultimate opera, composed for Vienna in 1843 less than a year before he lapsed into the illness that eventually killed him. With a plot based at the court of Louis XIII at the time of Cardinal Richelieu, the opera is notable for the condensed and economical style of its writing and its relative lack of vocal decoration. It is a pared-down Donizetti, as concise as middle period Verdi.The drama centres on the eponymous Countess, torn between her duty to her unloved husband and a former lover who returns to save his life. Despite the relative brevity of the piece, the plot registers as complex, and the score, though well composed, is not among Donizetti’s most memorable.But Wexford gives it a resounding relaunch, with a clear and impressively motivated production designed and directed by Charles Edwards, and a firm hand in the pit in the shape of conductor Roberto Polastri.Most impressive of all are the three principals – the Cuban soprano Eglise Gutierrez in the title role, the Canadian baritone James Westman as her husband, the Duke of Chevreuse, and the Armenian tenor Yeghishe Manucharyan as Riccardo, Count of Chalais. All three sing heroically and deserve to enjoy top-ranking careers.

A production at Wexford gives us a welcome chance for reassessment.The result falls into the category of an interesting failure. The score, showing at times a Wagnerian influence, and elsewhere the refinement of the composer’s best works, is delicate and subtly nuanced – arguably too much so for the rough and tumble of the theatre. The libretto presents the familiar subject of Ulysses’ return to Ithaca, where his wife Penelope has waited ten long years with the troublesome suitors harassing her. Though she initially fails to recognise her own husband, their final reunion sees him slaughter these unwelcome and parasitical guests.It is a narrative a composer with a stronger feeling for drama, like Monteverdi, could make a lot of but Faure has trouble keeping the momentum going. So here does conductor Jean-Luc Tingaud, whose soporific approach further damages the work’s prospects.Nor is it helped by a staging, courtesy of designer Andre Barbe and director Renaud Doucet, which insists that the piece is about a continuing marriage rather than an interrupted one. Displaying Penelope’s suitors as different aspects of Ulysses, and her maids as aspects of herself, is a serious error.The cast works hard, though there is a lot against them, and despite much beautiful music the piece fails to persuade.

It is infinitely more effective than the usual approach adopted when attempting to introduce the genre to the masses, which usually involves taking scaled-down productions of Die Fledermaus to local community centres and factory canteens.This is a piece which avoids such pitfalls and emerges as a canny and clever work with much to recommend it. For all its modernity and irreverence it is to be hoped that operatic anoraks will take it to their hearts in much the same way as the opening night audience did at the world premiere at Taliesin, which co-produced the piece along with the Quebec-based artists’ collective Le Chien Qui Chante.In a word, brilliant – or, as the publicity would have it “a light bite but no bark”.

Few sopranos can truly straddle those extremes but Cheryl Barker, in this second revival of David Leveaux’s 1996 production, marries them up convincingly.Though her wily charms could be more lascivious, her vocal power remains undiminished throughout the show and while her insistent demands for the head of Jokanaan (John the Baptist) are disturbing enough, her depraved pleasure in finally kissing the dead prophet’s lips is even more starkly drawn. The Dance of the Seven Veils, though, on the first night, seemed still to need working into the psyche, stopping short of fervent, unself-conscious abandon.Barker has a brilliant stepfather (Herod) in John Graham-Hall, desperately crumbling under his obsession, and the richly marbled support of Sally Burgess as her spurned mother, Herodias. Rebecca de Pont Davies makes a strong impression as Herodias’s Page, but Geraint Hylton – replacing Andrew Rees as the self-impaling Narraboth on the first night – lacked power and sustained line in his singing.The dank, free-standing wall beside the underground cistern where Jokanaan is imprisoned is an effective centrepiece, but the stage often seems awkwardly filled with unoccupied Nazarenes and Romans.Kwame Ryan makes his UK opera house debut, alert to Strauss’ driving dissonance and psychological intensity, and generously profiling the score’s burgeoning climaxes.

In this revival of Graham Vick’s Glyndebourne production from 2000, directed by Jacopo Spirei, the opera’s wit seems to lose its edge.Cherubino’s cross-dressing scene can be so much funnier and the Count’s potential discovery of him in the Countess’ chamber tighter coiled in tension. Richard Hudson’s spare, ‘rehearsal stage’ design works well enough, though the series of gauze frames – for all that they create the impression of an open palace where actions behind closed doors are also in the open – are haphazardly demarcated. And while a group of cooing, bleeting servants are all that signals Act IV’s garden setting, the music cries out for something more enchanted and magical.Jeremy Carpenter certainly looks the part of the suave Count, with the young Kate Royal dignified beyond her years as Countess. Iain Paterson is a good-humoured, but not an extrovert, Figaro, and Anna Maria Panzarella a vocally lithe and dramatically feisty Susanna. One of the evening’s highlights is Amy Freston’s Cherubino, a cocktail of high energy and adolescent hormones, coupled with an attractive light vocal quality. Thomas Rosner fails to set the orchestra alight, but nevertheless leads with assurance.

Christine Rice as the eponymous Cinderella and Matthew Beale as her prince, Don Ramiro, are the twin supports that hold the production together. For all that the buffo qualities are downplayed – leading to less side-splitting than one might hope for – the enlightenment influence of this reinterpretation of Perrault’s fairytale is clearer than ever.Cinderella’s long suffering is mitigated by her own self-knowledge and Ramiro is steadfast in overlooking the superficially beautiful in favour of the deeply rewarding. Rice’s rich, creamy lyricism wins you over quickly, though the high coloratura is not always thrillingly articulated, and Beale’s light lyricism, perfect for the role, also delivers on drama.But then you get Henry Waddington’s Don Magnifico – the caricatured father eager to marry of his two ‘best’ girls – a grubby, cushion-bellied pantomime fool, and the over-the-top window and door slamming in Act III’s storm. The period feel of the costumes and sets are unconvincingly halted with suddenly dipped lighting, as characters step outside of the action, an effect that is jolting and unrevealing.Giorgio Caoduro weakly characterises the role of Ramiro’s valet, but the singing is good all round, not least from Andrew Foster-Williams’ sage Alidoro and the ‘pretty’ ugly sisters, sung by Claire Ormshaw and Louise Armit. Edward Gardner, in his second year as GOT’s music director, elicits spry detail and atmosphere at will, constantly and unexpectedly pointing up details in the score.

What with a depressing set of the rundown Pontevedrian embassy, long stretches of Jeremy Sams’ arch dialogue – which cries out for cuts – and plodding French farcical goings-on, the omens appear gloomy for the Patrice Caurier/Moshe Leiser staging.Fortunately the Viennese warmth and charm bubble through in Act II, backed by a lovely setting with gorgeous costumes, leading on to the riotous visit to the hedonistic Maxim’s. In this the chorus and dancers are at their vibrant best, while Michal Klauza conducts the lyrical account with the lightest of touches.Lesley Garrett, who began her career with WNO, stunningly attired by Agostino Cavalca, projects a kittenish, rather jolly, Hanna, perhaps not grandly seductive enough, but her heartfelt Vilja provides moments of sheer nostalgic magic.Combining well with Garrett, Jeffrey Black characterises the incorrigible Danilov as no dandy but a drunken rake. His undoubted masculine charm may lack suavity but this is more than compensated for by the sexual chemistry generated.As the would-be lovers Valencienne and Camille, Ailish Tynan and Tracey Welborn are well matched, though too often somewhat underpowered. Donald Maxwell revels in the role of the blustering Baron Zeta, while Linda Ormiston provides a standout cameo as Praskowia, a heavyweight still keen in her pursuit of love. Geoffrey Dolton is quite bizarre as a loony Njegus, which may not be Lehar, but his cavortings certainly enliven the action.

The commedia dell’arte staging, designed by Russell Craig, has already made it an all time WNO favourite but this time around it reaches new heights of spot-on interaction, being not only delightfully sung but very, very funny.On the ramshackle four-level fit-up placed centre stage, with its cramped acting areas, tricky sets of stairs, battered furniture, tatty props and desperately worn painted curtains, the company absolutely sparkle in their ‘improvisations’. The continuos byplay between the strolling players and their onstage audience who occasionally join in or stay to watch only their favourite performers, provides an added entertainment in itself.The South African tenor Colin Lee handles his ardent courting in various disguise with the lightest of lyrical touches and comic timing, combining well with the feisty Rosina of Imelda Drumm. Andrew Schroeder is content to fit seamlessly into the tune-filled farcical romp without attempting to dominate as so many Figaros do. There are excellent cameos by Elizabeth Donovan as a surprisingly jolly Berta and Daniel Sumegi as an outrageously devious Basilio. Quite unforgettable is Eric Roberts as the funniest Bartolo it has ever been my good fortune to witness. Hilarious.Conducted by Gareth Jones and sung in English, this co-production with Opera North and Vancouver Opera is an absolute joy throughout. Long may it continue to be so.

Influenced by Debussy and Musorgsky, it also has the delicate lines and subtle harmonies of Poulenc’s best manner. Rarely has so much been said on the operatic stage with so few notes. Paul Daniel conducts it marvellously.As the central character, Blanche de la Force, Catrin Wyn-Davies presents vividly a woman who lives her life constantly in fear but who dies with courage. Dame Josephine Barstow once again graces the London stage with her flawless portrayal of Mother Marie, and Orla Boylan is rock solid as Madame Lidoine. As the elderly, dying Prioress, Felicity Palmer is beyond praise, while Sarah Tynan delivers the apparently superficial Constance with great insight.These women dominate the opera, but there are strong performances also from Ashley Holland as Blanche’s aristocratic father Peter Wedd as her brother and especially Ryland Davies, whose account of the Chaplain is a superb acting study.Indeed it is a high-powered evening, both vocally and dramatically, and many touches in Lloyd’s detailed staging hit all the way home. The final scene is shattering. Do not miss this wonderful production. It is opera at its very best.

The crass, symbolic clutter of Wotan’s neo-Gothic sky-lab has gone. Stefanos Lazaridis’ Siegfried settings provide the rubble of a post-nuclear attack, with crashed plane, for Mime’s den, with ruins, upward-curving slope and lush green inner sanctum for the forest. Best of all is a revolving, tilting square slab for Wotan’s troubled slumbers.Keith Warner’s direction is crisper, clearer, focusing on character interaction and development. The encounters between John Tomlinson’s Wotan and both Gerhard Siegel’s mad scientist Mime and Jane Henschel’s troubled Erda are subtle studies in evasion and angst, all three on electrifying vocal form. Ditto Phillip Ens’ Fafner and Peter Sidholm’s Alberich.Context is crystal clear – a devastated Earth on the skids, witness Alberich’s and Fafner’s radiation-raw body parts, the hideous, slavering monster a knockout. Wanted: an untainted hero.Into the ring steps John Treleaven’s stunning, subtly acted Siegfried, his heroic tenor resounding strong and true to the close, with many a shapely and softly-sung phrase. Inexperience and warmth of heart temper his Siegfried’s exasperating energy and exuberance. Innocence becomes redemptive. It is a towering portrayal.Lisa Gasteen’s impassioned Brunhilde sings with expressive power. She and Treleaven heart-stoppingly depict the pair’s inner struggles to assimilate mortality, fear, and the insistent physical imperatives of burgeoning love.Miraculously, they overcome the unhelpful relicts of Rheingold and Walkure, the cop-out which deprives the audience of Siegfried’s waking of Brunhilde, and Wolfgang Gobbel’s quixotic lighting, which renders a sickly yellow the transforming sunlight presaging a new world.Antonio Pappano conducts a better paced, more coherent reading than he achieved in the preceding Tetralogy operas.

Instead, this new production tours Scotland’s smaller theatres with a cast of seven and piano accompaniment from Oliver Rundell.Dominic Hill is the perfect director for such an intimate endeavour. He helps the singers find the personal and the human in their characters and then use their acting to drive the story on. Transporting the setting to civil war-torn modern Serbia helps. As the witches – Caroline Chile, Anthea Kempston and Karina Lucas in particularly fine voice – fight over scraps, a bomb-blasted farmhouse seems their perfectly natural habitat.Without orchestral colour, the skills of designer Tom Piper and lighting designer Bruno Poet, are invaluable too. Indeed, the scene change from farmhouse to the Macbeth’s castle is achieved purely through lighting and Helena Leonard’s acting as Lady Macbeth. She, as much as any in the cast, seems to appreciate the chance to let both her voice and acting become liberated by the scale of the production.Hill’s one failure is Douglas Bowen’s Macbeth, who he plays as if in a catatonic shock. He can act, as the final scene reveals, but until then you had better know the plot, because Bowen’s acting is not giving anything away. Even the young lad brought in to play Fleance acts Bowen off the stage. Rather better are Richard Wiegold and Adrian Dwyer as Banquo and Macduff. It is not a fatal flaw, just annoying enough to mar an otherwise fascinating production.

Audiences were ecstatic. It’s not difficult to see why.Nabucco surges with a boundless, self-confident energy as it chronicles the Hebrew opposition to the Babylonian tyranny. Verdi imbues the struggle with verve and ferocity, the strong emotions carried upon glorious, long-breathed melodies. The use of chorus is masterly, the brass writing ceremonial yet pugnacious.Future thematic preoccupations surface, such as father-daughter relationships, the effect of social pressures upon private passions. Characterisation is rooted firmly in the music, though the pell-mell action strains in-depth development. Even so, Zaccaria is a unique creation – prophet, leader of his people, commentator and audience mediator.Opera North had assembled a fine cast who sang with an impassioned involvement, as did the excellent chorus, under difficult circumstances. Alan Opie found the innate humanity buried beneath Nabucco’s aggression, Claire Rutter the inner warmth stifled by Abigaille’s jealousy and resentment.In lesser roles, Leonado Capalbo and Jane Irwin impressed as the lovers Ismaele and Fenena, Camilla Roberts as Zaccaria’s sister Anna. Alastair Miles was a reliable prophet.Disastrously, conductor David Parry bashed through the score – the orchestra on blazing form – with the subtlety of a beer festival bandmaster, so that only rarely could the cast and chorus sing off words which, in the faster numbers, had to be gabbled. He rendered Nabucco’s exhilarating mix of opulence and intimacy an undignified scramble.

Both sing well, the former assuming an almost un-Papageno-like eloquence in song, the latter a rewardingly rich, true bass. But Bayley lacks the gravitas and sage-like leadership that Sarastro requires.First night nerves seemed to cause the occasional ensemble hitch between stage and pit and the odd ill-judged balance, which, coupled with occasionally unsettled playing, amounted to an inauspicious debut for conductor David Stern. Janice Watson, surprisingly, failed to shine as she usually does, singing Pamina, and Helen Williams’s Queen of Night, though dramatically effective, could have impressed with cleaner vocal agility.Elizabeth Watts, a recent addition to ENO’s Young Singers Programme, makes a promising company debut as Papagena, cackling so vehemently in her old-woman incarnation it’s a miracle she can follow that with any singing at all.Alongside Shore’s admirable Papageno stands Toby Spence’s pillar-like Tamino. Capable of resplendent power – as in his portrait aria and his dramatic recitative before approaching the doors of Reason, Nature and Wisdom – his faith remains undimmed. What is revealingly clear in this production is that these characters’ opposite poles of self-discipline, and their differing streaks of naivety, are entirely complementary.

Opera North staged it in 1990 but this transfer of David Pountney’s Bregenz production represents its Covent Garden premiere.It is certainly a worthwhile piece, based on a classic comedy by Ludvig Holberg, the ‘Moliere of the North’. The scandalous masked balls in Copenhagen provide a meeting place for all the central characters in the final scene, with parental opposition to the love affairs of the young eventually removed. Nielsen sets it to a clever score, packed with musical ideas and providing the orchestra – here conducted by Michael Schonwandt – with plenty to do. In a good production it would work a treat.Unfortunately Pountney settles for a Carry On approach that undermines the piece from start to finish. His own translation lowers the tone with groan-making rhymes. The over-choreographed dance routines in the last act, with Elvis and Marilyn Monroe joining in, belong in another show entirely. The whole thing is vulgar without being funny and desperately misguided.Better musical values cannot salvage a dire evening. Gail Pearson is sparky as Pernille and Kari Hamnoy adds some genuine style as Magdelone but even such normally reliable performers as Brindley Sherratt (as Jeronimus) look lost at sea.A shame, because there is a great opera here, screaming to be let out of the tat and camp Pountney smothers it in.

Restoring much fine music cut by the composer to make the work more manageable, this staging – ten years in the preparation – proves to be a triumph well worth waiting for.In crucifix-dominated sets by John Engels, three generations of Spanish royalty are depicted in tests of love and loyalty, caught in a gripping battle between Church and State. The oppressive black crosses change to gory red as the obscene horrors of the Inquisition unfold.Though at times motivations become confused in this updated police state, where submachine guns clash with 16th century-style tortures and heretic burnings, director John Caird effectively counterpoints the drama’s powerful sweep with the agonising personal choices to be made by individuals.Costumes by Carl Friedrich Oberle contrast the drabness of war-weary peasantry and sombre-suited formality of the male court with the stylish finery of the female entourage.The duets of the passionate Carlos and the thwarted Elisabeth, the backbone of the opera, are beautifully handled by husband-and-wife team Paul Charles Clarke and Nuccia Focile, responding with great sensitivity to Carlos Rossi’s masterly control of the orchestra.Andrea Silvestrelli gives a performance of towering authority as the malevolent Philippe II, well matched in his confrontations with the merciless Grand Inquisitor of Daniel Sumegi.Outstanding too is the portrayal of the altruistic Posa by Scott Hendricks, while the Princess Eboli of Guang Yang is sung with fine lyrical brilliance. Supporting roles are well characterised and the large chorus under Donald Nally is in impressive form. Sung in the original French with surtitles in English – and Welsh in Wales – this epic co-production with Canadian Opera is surely a must for all lovers of Verdi.

It is not a bundle of laughs.By contrast, Gerald Barry’s new opera, which sets Fassbinder’s text in its entirety, careers along like a charging rhino, the dialogue delivered lickety-split, supported pervasively by aggressive brass in full cry, often doubling the vocal line. It is erotic, exhausting, histrionic, at times hilarious. Or is it?Director Richard Jones, the cast and the conductor Andre de Ridder, who has the ENO orchestra playing at white heat, made it seem so at the enthralling world premiere. Indeed, Jones’ production is a superlative masterclass in stagecraft, required viewing for those cohorts of unweaned young directors peddling undigested ideas.Within Ultz’s cool, fashionable interior, he thrillingly choreographs the emotional maelstrom and power games resulting from svelte couturier Petra’s obsession with the callow, exploitative Katrin, from her secretary Marlene’s tormented, masochistic passion  for her. Direction, design and lighting (Mimi Jordan Sherrin) are a symbiotic triumph.Meanwhile Stephanie Friede’s ‘tour de force’ of a Petra commandingly tames vocal lines as vertiginous as volatile temperature charts. So does Barbara Hannigan as Petra’s dysfunctional daughter Gabriele, a deeply disturbing portrayal.Rebecca von Lipinski’s leggy, faun-like Karin casually deploys killer instincts, Linda Kitchen’s mute Marlene seethes with unrequited passion, while Kathryn Harries and Susan Bickley alarmingly embody Petra’s mother and inquisitive friend Sidonie.This stunning production renders Barry’s music largely superfluous, which is not to say it is without interest.

The Polka positively reeks of whisky, tobacco, sweat and tears, Minnie’s cabin is cosier than ever, while the wrinkles in the backcloth of mountains have been ironed out.Two ROH stalwarts of the original 1977 production also return – Robert Lloyd as the Wells Fargo agent Ashby, and the indestructible Francis Egerton as Nick, whose delivery of Ve le giuro, sceriffo in Act III is heart-wrenching. Grant Doyle’s Bello, Adrian Clarke’s Sid and Robert Murray’s Harry are notable in support.Inevitably, the main interest centres upon the three principals. Jack Rance disappoints, his over-parted baritone occluded in tone and weak in alt. The acting is polite. However, Andrea Gruber’s feisty Minnie is almost the genuine article. The voice may coarsen and spread under pressure, while she tends to play ‘girlish’, but she convinces completely as the object of the miners’ love.As for Jose Cura, the role of Dick Johnson, alias the bandit Ramerrez, might have been written for him. He plays it to the hilt, his burnished, baritonal tenor shaping the vocal lines with a subtle regard for meaning and emotion. And he can’t half open up for the big moments like Ch’ella mi creda. Terrific stuff.Antonio Pappano again disappoints. His brash and sentimentalised reading fails to realise the score’s architecture, while he sometimes overplays climaxes, thus drowning singers.

It says much for the confidence of the two stars of this production – Michael McBride as Romeo and Anna Leese as Juliette – that they cope so well with the four big duets that form the backbone of the score and much else. Gounod’s demanding vocalism may take them right to their limits but they survive.It’s a handsome show, with simple but effective sets by Jamie Vartan and costumes by Donatella Barbieri that place the action in the sixties. Beehive hairdos are worn for the jiving in the opening party scene and the main fight – extremely well executed, incidentally – is fought with flick-knives. Throughout Olivia Fuchs’ production is economical and well-motivated.The Southbank Sinfonia plays the delicate score skilfully under Peter Robinson, though at times it requires more impetus and elsewhere more finesse to register as positively as it should.But with this company – one of the most vital training grounds for the next generation of artists – the focus is on the young cast, and they do not disappoint.Especially strong are Nicola Stonehouse’s cheeky Stephano, Elizabeth Key’s memorable Nurse, Dawid Kimberg’s striking Duke and Marc Labonnette’s sonorous Capulet. There’s also a resonant Friar Laurence from Lukasz Jakobczyk and a fine Gregorio from Whitaker Mills, while Jacques Imbrailo supplies an absolutely first-rate Mercutio.

It begins promisingly in a cinema, viewed by the audience from behind a gauze screen, on to which the credits for Top Gun are rolling. The ice-cream sellers later appear in other serving guises, their carrying trays cleverly used to present a kebab shop, beer-pumps on a bar and, in the end, a urinal for the three male characters.But the girls at home watching the small screen don’t totally convince us of their excited ardour for their fiances in the next scene, and the simple set – a three-sided arrangement of doors and translucent panels – is unappealingly plain. Oddly, the chorus is crowded to the edge of the stage as they send the boys off on military duty, with a simultaneous small-screen appearance that simply doesn’t work.The Top Gun theme is picked up again when the Guglielmo and Ferrando return disguised as pilots – though Tom Cruises they are not, with frumpy boots, ear-muffs and goggles – zooming around, arms outstretched in a novel mating dance. Their Act II serenade (‘Secondate, aurette amiche’ – ‘Hear us, friendly breezes’) is aptly sung to an amusingly mimed parachute jump.Musically, there were some serious first-night ensemble problems but under Paul McGrath’s direction, the Southbank Sinfonia performed with considerable energy and not a little sophistication.Joana Seara’s comic and assuredly foxy Despina and Erica Eloff’s promising Fiordiligi – clean-toned across a wide vocal range and touchingly presenting her moral dilemma – were the highlights, alongside James Robinson’s coolly relaxed Don Alfonso.There is the basis here for a strong, contemporary Cosi but it needs a little sprucing in one or two departments.

Frederic Pineau’s Act I boudoir is beset around in gold cupids and huge white roses that are completely apposite to the work’s comedy, which concerns extra-marital affairs, sugar daddies and the benefits of anonymous sex.If the early scenes are heavy on plot development – setting up ‘She’ with her two sugar daddies – they are not without their musical inventiveness. Particularly the second lover, Francis Dudziak’s Maharaja, whose languid, low-pitched tunes are changed into high, pattering notes by his interpreter, Franck Cassard. If that is a trick used more effectively than for effect, Messager is quick to give his leading lady the first big aria. Sophie Haudebourg’s She is every bit equal to this show-stopping piece of gorgeousness in Mon Reve.Sophie Herve and Lydia Mayo are comfortable in their roles as She’s two maids and do enough with their characters to make their eventual seduction by the sugar daddies, while She goes off with Jean Dalric as He, completely in keeping. Musically, only Bernard Pisani’s account of the first lover, Baron Agnot, is lacking. His direction, however, is superb throughout, using the small chorus in Act II’s party to great comic effect and rounding out Act III’s surprisingly happy end with a big risque kiss-off.

And Anthony Neilson’s staging, if anything, comes down quite harshly on the terrorists. D’Arcy Bleiker’s Rambo is a sadistic thug, Oriol Roses’ Omar a scary fanatic, despite his countertenor – it is a mezzo role – sounding wrong.Set aboard Miriam Buether’s allusively designed ship (portholes, gangplank), Neilson goes for visceral effects – taped sea and seagull sounds in the foyers, explosions, bullying terrorists grimacing, shouting and waving guns – jettisoning the reflective anguish and concern of the Bach Passions which inspired Adams’ masterpiece.Neilson also misconceives the Captain and the Austrian Woman, he recklessly slugging back Martinis while Claire Booth’s nubile, brightly-sung British Dancing Girl sashays around distracting from his words, she characterised as an aged, chocolate-guzzling grotesque. Such visual jokes jar offensively.Thank god for Kamel Boutros’ restive, grippingly sung Mamoud, who delivers Those Birds Flying with heart-stopping intensity. Jonathan Summers and Catherine Wyn-Rogers bring a moving dignity to the luckless Klinghoffers. Darren Abrahams catches Molqi’s excitability in clarion, centred tenor tones. Elizabeth Sikora’s Swiss Grandmother is a cameo gem.Edward Gardner conducts an electrifying reading, the orchestra at fever pitch, though amplification muddies and distorts the score’s transparent textures, especially above forte. Ditto for the chorus interventions. A pity John Adams’ brave, inspiriting score suffers so crude a staging on this important occasion.

Jean-Louis Martinoty’s production for the Rossini Opera Festival, Pesaro, boasts stunning sets by Hans Schavernoch, featuring projections of paintings which evoke the architectural splendour of 18th-century Venice. These are presided over by huge model of the winged lion from St Mark’s Piazzetta – imposing but claustrophobic.A pair of gilt-edged Perspex-panelled doors open and close in various formations. In tandem with Gigi Saccomandi’s subtle shifts of lighting, these variously and deftly serve to demarcate the scene settings, such as shutting off the carnival after the first scene, add depth – separating Bianca’s bedroom from her maids without – or create special effect, as when introducing behind-the-screen doubles to the star-crossed couple in their Act I duet.It is perhaps overkill to mark out the initially opposing senators Conterone and Capellio in starkly red and green costumes respectively and some of the acting tends towards the hammy. But the singing is mostly exceptional, especially from Maria Bayo’s light but fruity Bianca – almost faultless, though the Italians are quick to make it known if fault be found, and Daniela Barcellona’s physically imposing and vocally heroic Falliero. The young tenor Francesco Meli is surprisingly well cast as Bianca’s father Conterone, he has a naturally open sound but is capable of unleashing lascerating anger and has stamina to spare.A sophisticated-sounding chorus, the Coro da Camera di Praga, and a well-drilled, stylish orchestra – the Galicia SO – under the sharp direction of Renato Palumbo still isn’t enough to rescue this opera from its current obscurity but this new production certainly bathed it in a positive light.

Though there is a slightly cutting quality to the voice, his is a wondrously agile instrument and with a truly lyrical gift. Equally appealing was his feisty Rosina, Kansas-born Joyce DiDonato.The main quartet was completed by a honey-toned Bruno de Simone as Bartolo, also a natural comic actor, and Dalibor Jenis’s richly voiced and dramatically magnetic Figaro.The vocal quality remained a welcome constant in an otherwise disparate new production by Luca Ronconi. Black-and-white film scenes, projected on a cinema screen, echo points of the action on stage, or is it vice versa? Fiorello’s musicians enter from a VW camper van parked on the left, while on the right is a tall, sideways-on recording studio control-room cum lift shaft, occupied by anonymous operator in Act I. The ascending/descending theme continues as chairs, cupboards, even Bartolo’s bathroom and Alonso’s grand piano, drop from above on strings, as does the collection of metal trunks in which Bartolo keeps Rosina locked away. A notable horizontal exception is the arrival of Don Basilio – sung by Natale de Carlos, the weakest link in the cast – out of a large refrigerator.Daniele Gatti’s confident if sometimes wilful command over his Orchestra of the Teatro Comunale, Bologna, drew an isolated booing from the crowd but nevertheless the music was very much the saviour of this very up-and-down production.

Not just musically but as a very complex character – passionate, enthusiastic, artistic and totally unreliable. In Stephen Gould Bayreuth has one of the best Tannhauser’s for many years. His voice is powerful, beautiful and wonderfully even throughout his whole range.His Rome narration in the last act and his agony – until the coming of Elisabeth’s funeral bier brings him absolution and the relief of death – are almost unbearably poignant. This production and d?cor by Philippe Arlaud are now several years old and get better with each revival. The Venusberg is bleak and bare with three little temptresses in the background like Rhinemaidens. Judit Nemeth is Venus, handsome of person and voice but not remarkable.The simple flowered valley of the Wartburg is enchanting. Young, with new green and dotted with scarlet poppies, which are withered for the last act.Christian Thielemann, one of the most gifted Wagner conductors of this generation, gives the score life and love. Ricarda Merbeth as Elisabeth looks lovely but at the beginning her singing is too vibrato – hard, metallic. Elisabeth’s strength is spiritual, not forceful, and the voice must sound pure. This comes later, and then she is most moving.The tall, slender, ascetic-looking Roman Trekel makes a good Wolfram von Eschenbach, who loves Elisabeth without hope of return. Guido Jentjen’s Landgraf is disappointing, both voice and acting lack authority, but the young shepherd’s voice (Robin Johannsen) gives a charming, lyrical introduction to the meadows of the Wartburg.

The Bayreuth Festival’s new production of Tristan und Isolde must be recorded and issued on CD.This is a splendid musical performance with magnificent singing by nearly all the cast. Truly Wagnerian singing in the best sense and worthy to bear comparison with the great artists of the past.But note that CD is what is called for, not DVD, for this is a classice example of a production that should be heard but not seen. To return to the glories, Eiji Oue, the Japanese conductor who has performed in many parts of the world, and is professor of conducting at Hanover’s musical high school, has the feel of the Bayreuth acoustics.Not all have this but as the first notes of the prelude sounded, the extraordinary enveloping magic of sound in this building touches heart and mind.Nina Stemme’s Isolde matches and blends with this, passionate singing with great power and beauty. She looks a very young Isolde. Slim, attractive, girlish and well matched with Petra Lang’s already world famous Brangane.Robert Dean Smith’s Tristan is an interesting, very well sung performance. He has been a stalwart of Bayreuth for the past eight years and this is his crowning achievement.Only Andreas Schmidt’s Kurwenal is disappointing but he was said to be unwell and the production makes him a doddering old man who goes mad at the end, fingering the walls and trotting round and round the dying Tristan.There is nothing new about Christoph Marthaler’s production or Anna Viebrock’s designs and modern costumes, which prevent anyone being killed in a fight as they carry no swords. Melot manages to find a dagger and stabs Tristan but Kurwenal survives. The opening song of the young sailor is exquiaitely sung by Clemens Bieber.

But those qualities spell boredom to the modern producer. When Claus Guth first directed this production for the Bayreuth Festival two or three years ago, he chose to make it a fairy story and read to a small girl who soon identified herself with the heroine Senta.The child – a non-speaking part of course – is dressed exactly like Senta herself and her father (Daland) reads.This belittles Wagner’s noble music but it works after a fashion. Now much has changed. It is a great deal spookier, with both Sentas often terrified. It is not at all clear what psychological interpretation Guth intends.The result, alas, is a full-scale muddle. Many of Wagner’s operas have a happy ending in death, as in this one. But here there is no ending at all, only Senta knocking at a door through which the Dutchman has gone. Marc Albrecht conducts a lively, exciting performance with much more noise than romance. The chorus – as always in Bayreuth – is in fine form.John Tomlinson was scheduled to sing the Dutchman but had to withdraw as he had an operation. He was replaced by Jukka Rasilainen, who has a fine voice. But the vocal star, as before, is Jaakko Ryhanen’s Daland, magnificently sung. Adrienne Dugger is vocally good but a strangely nervous Senta. Endrik Wottrich’s Erik is down played by the production.

That is true of this one which was launched in the Bayreuth Festival of 1999. It was, and is, a production by Keith Warner with sets designed by Stefanos Lazaridis and costumes by Sue Blane.The chief criticism, heard mainly from newcomers, is darkness, the almost underworld of the Brabantians and their black costumes. The knights following King Heinrich are all in silver armour and stand motionless in several rows above, on an upper platform. The King comes down to take part in the action but these knights never. They form a musical frieze.Peter Schneider, the conductor, is an old hand at Bayreuth and knows how to get the orchestra and above all the famous chorus to give of their best. Lohengrin himself has been played by several tenors during the life of this production but none better than Peter Seiffert, who sings this year. The production does not allow of any other worldliness about this saintly knight but Seiffert has not only a very fine voice but a pleasing, kindly authority.Petra-Maria Schnitzer looks a lovely little Elsa. At the beginning she forces her voice to shrillness once or twice but this passes. In Reinhard Hagen we have a good king Heinrich with a strong, sonorous voice. Linda Watson makes an impressive, evil character of Ortrud but the production forces Hartmut Welker to be too feeble a Telramund and he shouts more than he sings. The tall, ascetic Roman Trekel is an admirable Herald.

First given at last years Bayreuth Festival, people have been discussing it ever since. Is it a burlesque? No, though there are a number of things which cause unintended laughter. Is it a new idea of Armageddon? Hardly that, for the end of Parsifal and Amfortas is not the end of the world.It is not only the audience who are bewildered. Many of the highly experienced Festspielhaus staff cannot see the meaing either. High and low old Wagnerites and young newcomers seem to agree that there is no meaning. It is simply a muddle.Parsifal has a magnificent record at Bayreuth since the Second World War. Wieland Wagner’s classic production continued in the programme for 23 years.Then came an equally fine and beautiful one by his brother Wolfgang. Then an interesting one by Gotz Friedrich, followed by another fine one by Wolfgang Wagner. Then this.Take a few truckloads of old, broken scenery, add huts, stalls, strange devices suggesting a religious cult deifying the Rabbit. Add countless people of all colours and religious costumes. Put all together on a revolving stage, shake thoroughly and add a flavouring of film projection of everything from Gothic castles to a heaving mass of seals in the sea.Over and through all this is Wagner’s most inspired and beautiful music, conducted by Pierre Boulez, who led a memorable series of Parsifal years ago in Wieland’s staging. Happily the preludes to acts are played without stage pictures. Robert Holl sings a fine Gurnemanz, Alexander MarcoBurhmester is vocally good as Amfortas. Alfons Eberz is Parsifal, Michelle de Young takes the role of Kundry, John Wegner performs as Klingsor. All are good and all deserve sympathy.

The ‘surprise’ ensembles are a hilarious fusion of misapprehension and disbelief.Peter Bridges conducts a lively reading of a reduced score, conjuring colour enough with the limited palette, always considerate of the singers, who are Garden Opera’s main strength. This is especially true given Martin Lloyd-Evans pantomime staging – ‘force majeure’ without chorus, so an all-important dimension is lost.Lloyd-Evans requires the hapless Catherine Hegarty and Alison Rae Jones, Clorinda and Tisbe, to mug and moue outrageously. Would a prince give such grotesques even a passing glance? They sing out strongly though, as does Robert Presley’s thoroughly vindictive Don Magnifico – no Baron Hard-Up he.John Llewelyn Evans’ likeable cockney Dandini negotiates the challenging vocal lines with admirable sang froid. John Upperton’s anonymous Prince (the director’s fault) is nippy across the staves, and lacks only bloom to the tone in alt. Stefan Holmstrom brings a quirky dignity to his well-sung Alidoro.Thomasin Trezise’s Angelina, whom Lloyd-Evans initially makes too much the drudge, is the evening’s triumph. Her stage presence is a constant delight, the divisions of her warm mezzo securely integrated, the coloratura delivered meaningfully. Well worth catching.

It centres around a refugee who tries unsuccessfully to enlist the help of fellow travellers. But the opera is as much about their personal journeys too. Tina and Bill are hoping to rekindle the frisson of their earlier relationship as an older woman waits in vain for her toyboy fiance, another couple are out to start a new life in Minsk.April de Angeles’ witty libretto wins plenty of laughs, not least when Bill’s voyage of self discovery leads to a fling with the male Steward. Yet the poignancy of individual stories remain clear. This is less true in Dove’s orchestral score, which prattles and fizzes effectively, but offers little pacing, except in the effective vocal writing. It is impossible to hear any Dove through the strongly assimilated influences of John Adams and Bernstein.Laura Aitken as Controller understandably loses many of her words in her high-altitude coloratura part, though Lawrence Zazzo’s counter-tenor Refugee is a winning performance, creamily voiced yet well projected. The supporting ensemble is strongly cast and Richard Farnes makes sure the London Philharmonic glistens with energy.Giles Cadle’s stylised yet believable sets are a boon and altogether the production is slickly successful. The opera just begs the question, would the real Jonathan Dove please step forward?

It is colourfully designed by Isabelle Partiot-Pieri (sets) and Katia Duflot (costumes) and astutely staged by the talented French director Charles Roubaud, who supplies what is easily the most lively and crisply performed of the three shows the Kirov has brought to London this time around. The Royal Opera should grab him.The cast is strong. Irina Gordei is a tireless Turandot, grandly imperious and vocally trenchant. She is extremely well partnered by the Calaf of the baritonal tenor Vladimir Galuzin, whose honed, powerful voice is combined with a stern stage presence.Irma Gigolashvili’s Liu is hardly less good, though she is not quite so secure vocally. But she is a fluent actress and is moving as the loving but doomed slave girl.There is a solid Timur from Gennady Bezzubenko and a notable trio of Mandarins in the shapes of Andrei Spekhov, Alexander Timchenko and Oleg Balashov.On this occasion the chorus is formidable and the orchestra, playing with a magnificent depth of tone, is on its strongest form. The Kirov’s charismatic artistic director and chief conductor Valery Gergiev shows a fine appreciation of the work’s structure and colouristic range and even manages the feat of making the Alfano ending sound on a par with the rest.In all a very classy evening and one that effaces bad memories of the Kirov’s disappointing Verdi season at Covent Garden in 2001.

Visually the stage designs, reproduced by Viacheslav Okunev, are lavish. There are the richly detailed onion-dome spires towering over Red Square as the streltsy – a bloodthirsty infantry corps – celebrate a successful night’s fighting in Act I, the luxurious vaulted interior of Prince Golitsyn’s study in Act II and even the impressive wood-clad ceiling at Ivan Khovansky’s retreat. In these designs, painted backcloths and built structures interact to harmonious effect and period costumes complete the look.Part of the payback for tradition it seems, is the odd moment of cardboardy acting and certainly the streltsy don’t convince that they are an animalistic bunch of seasoned fighters.Sergei Alexashkin sings a commanding Ivan Khovansky. He is powerful yet effusive, though Olga Borodina steals the show vocally and the sheer volume she produces can be stunning. Alexei Steblianko nobly sang through flu in the role of Golitsyn. Despite the odd cough, he was remarkably composed and preserved the voice in its upper range without at all selling the audience short. Singing Dosifey, former prince and now leader of the Old Believers, Vladimir Vaneev is a sage would-be reformer.Though conductor Valery Gergiev manages to keep the orchestra energised over a long evening, his choir sounded under par from the start, with flat-sounding sopranos and tenors struggling in their upper range. “What a dirge!”, Ivan proclaims at one point, calling for a more upbeat chorus from his servant girls – and he wasn’t far wrong.But there is a keen sense in this production of reaching deeper into the Russian history and psyche than a European production ever could and certainly it is a richly traditional piece of theatre.

Stripped of the later version’s Polish act and final forest scene after the death of Boris, this was in some ways a dramatically gripping show, played without an interval.The opening crowd scene, set in a monastery courtyard, relies for its atmosphere on a black backdrop and zombified proletariat hemmed in with ropes drawn from mobile floodlight units. The conception, for which Gergiev takes credit alongside set designer George Tsypin, gets more imaginative as the opera unfolds. Luminous patterned pillars descend for the Kremlin scenes, and onion domes, often with horn-like appendages, are suspended from on high. The beginning of the fifth scene, when Boris’ daughter Xenia weeps for her dead lover, looks gorgeous bathed in green, but more bizarrely, upon Boris’ death the central onion dome sprouts hairy silver insect legs which ensnare the prostrated Tsar.Musically, it’s a joy to hear Gergiev’s orchestra and choir in this Russian classic, and the singing is almost all good. Vladimir Vaneev’s not-too-thick bass worked well in the title role, while Sergei Alexashkin and Oleg Balashov created an engrossing scene between the chronicler Pimen and the young pretender to be, Grigory. Elsewhere, Gennady Bezzubenkov’s Varlaam entertained at the inn.While some aspects of the production may detract from the story’s dramatic intensity it is laudable that the Kirov does not feel bound by its rich history.

The outdoor arena of the Mac gave the opera a beautiful setting. This was a new version of Purcell’s masterpiece about a doomed love story set in classical mythology.There was a multicultural vibe, with the performance mixing the storytelling dance traditions of South Asia with classical music and singing. This combination works well with the emotive qualities of the choreography, giving a new dimension to the expression of the opera.Sonia Sabri gave a superbly emotional interpretation of Dido. Her passionate moves and facial expressions were unfortunately not equally met by her counterpart Shane Shambhu as Aeneas, who lacked presence.Seeta Patel, who danced the role of Belinda, was beautifully gracious in the fascinating storytelling moves of this Indian tradition. A scene that clearly stood out was one with the Sorcerer, danced by Kali Dass and sung by Ian Gifford, and his witches. Their dancing, costumes, singing, make-up and facial expressions all oozed comical evil, with a particularly delightful chorus of laughter and echo.The only difficulty with this opera is that it starts without introductions, meaning the uninitiated may have to spend precious time in a short production figuring out who is who from the outset. The style added to the original confusion, with each character played by a dancer and a singer, or a choir, in the background.

But although the stage remains largely clutter-free, there is sophistication aplenty.The wooden-slatted walls of Madame Larina’s country house cleverly open in Act III to reveal the facade of Prince Gremin’s St Petersburg mansion in the background, and the reverse sides present the amply furnished walls of the grand room where Onegin finally gets his tortured comeuppance from Tatyana. Stuart Stratford energises the City of London Sinfonia, highlighting the score’s passion and energy, and revelling in the touches of dance music and folk colour.Camilla Roberts’ Tatyana improves as the action progresses, reaching a natural peak with her final rejection of Onegin. Colin Stone, singing the title role, cuts every bit the dashing figure of the suave, pleasure-seeking townie and has the vocal capacity to boot. Opposite him, Peter Wedd’s Lensky fails to make much of a mark until his arrival at the fatal duel with Onegin.The character role of the nurse Filipyevna is well sung by Menai Davies, while as Olga, Victoria Simmonds’ opening duet with Tatyana is richly spun and seems all too short. Tyrone Landau as Monsieur Triquet makes an entertainingly overblown French dandy at Tatyana’s birthday celebration.Ultimately, Onegin’s emotional journey is more evident than Tatyana’s but this production is nevertheless well sung and played, and definitely worth a visit.

Mark Henderson’s lighting subtly defines time and evokes emotional states.Hall elicits driven central performances which delve deep into the conflict between good and evil, into Otello’s dark night of the soul, Desdemona’s anguish and humiliation, Iago’s insidious villainy.David Rendall creates an Otello whose nobility fatally triggers his downfall. It is a portrait achingly painful to watch. Vocally, his tonally secure, clarion tenor thrillingly projects both the Moor’s heroism and growing jealousy, moulding phrases with a firm line, colouring them to give meaning to text. This is a performance for the pantheon.Anthony Michaels-Moore repeats his “honest Iago”, the seamlessly smooth and assured singing creating a subtle dissembler betrayed only by little out front smirks and smiles which are chilling. His fearsome Credo momentarily outs evil.Tatiana Monogarova is the mettlesome Desdemona, the voice powerful yet pure, assured in its ability to carry a legato line. Jean Rigby’s Emilia is a feisty, fully-fledged cameo.Finally there is the miracle of Vladimir Jurowski’s conducting. The grasp of the work’s architecture is staggeringly sure and texturally translucent. The impeccable pacing propels the tragedy to its conclusion with a terrifying inevitability.

It is, to be frank, a crasher.The librettist Parini lumbers the teenage composer with an oratorio, whose sole idea is that Venus delays her son Ascanio’s marriage to Silvia to test the latter’s fidelity. Fauno, a tutor, and Aceste, a priest, collude. At over two hours, that is one hell of a delay.Despite instrumental felicities, Mozart’s score mostly comprises ternary arias in four-four time trundling along above churning accompaniments. The occasional digression into three-four brings blissful relief. Ritornellos dog every aria and there are swathes of accompanied recit.Only Silvia’s music rises above the routine, provides intimations of Mozart’s later masterpieces, notably when she sings of “endless sorrow” in her Act II scene. Gillian Keith delivers it with an easeful grace, indeed sings throughout with a peerless musicality, spinning a limpid legato which ravishes the senses.She is well matched by her fellow artists. Tom Randle’s Aceste is a likeable bumbler, Lynda Russell an endearingly blowsy, slightly slewed Venus. William Purefoy’s Ascanio graduates touchingly from gauche teenage scholar to impassioned lover, the while deploying a strikingly pure, finely projected countertenor.Harry Christophers conducts a crisp reading characterised by well integrated tempos and textual clarity, while Stephen Lawless brings an imaginative flair to the staging, which only occasionally betrays the effort expended in filling a vacuum with drama.

Leading the show is the Chenier of tenor John Hudson, who unfurls his vocal colours boldly right at the start and maintains high-voltage Italianate singing all the way through. Dramatically he is low on initiative but more than respectable.His fellow victim of the guillotine is Katarina Jovanovic as Maddalena, who registers as a little hard dramatically with a rough edge to her voice. However, her no-holds-barred vocalism is chiefly what this piece requires.Further vocal thrills are provided by Olafur Sigurdarson as the servant-turned-tyrant Gerard, who again takes time to warm to his task but brings the house down with ‘Nemico della patria’.Smaller standouts include Carole Wilson, who is comprehensively excellent in the dual roles of the Countess and Madelon, Heather Shipp’s attractive Bersi, and Richard Suart’s skilled double-act as Fleville and Fouquier.Martin Lloyd-Evan’s staging makes exciting use of the chorus and paints in the instability of the times with a sure hand. Peter Rice’s designs also offer full period value.Conductor Peter Robinson galvanizes proceedings from the pit and the result is a genuinely rousing evening of verismo opera, sung and played to the hilt.

The orchestration is crystalline, the rhythmic momentum exuberant. At Buxton it finds a perfect home, in a staging which mostly reveals its inimitable treasures.For a start, it is sung in English, the outstanding cast delivering the spoken passages taken from Shakespeare’s play as if to the manner born, projecting the sung text into the auditorium with crystal clarity. The flair and imagination of their controlled characterisations enrich and embody the comedy.In the opening scene comparing letters, Helen Williams and Yvonne Howard as Mistresses Ford and Page exemplify the cast’s virtues. They sing off words with tonal warmth, every note centred, while subtly shaping portraits shorn of exaggeration. Williams negotiates the taxing stratospheric reaches of her role with ease and elan.Mark Richardson’s laid-back Page contrasts perfectly with Roderick Earle’s precipitate Ford, while Geoffrey Dolton’s intemperate Dr Caius amusingly intimidates John Graham-Hall’s wilting Slender. James Rutherford is a benign Falstaff, well able to plumb the vocal depths.Hal Cazalet sings an impassioned Fenton. His shaping of the Act II serenade would melt an ice queen, never mind Gail Pearson’s sparky Anne. And Anthony Greenwood guides orchestra and chorus through a lively reading always supportive of the singers.A pity, then, that Ashley Martin Davis’ crudely coloured DIY settings are so unevocative, that Lang recycles some hoary old business – drunks falling off benches – and sanctions breaks for scene changes which put the brakes on a narrative which should race along.

I recall with pleasure his East and West at the Almeida in 1994. The present piece is described as “a children’s opera” but something has gone seriously wrong between intention and execution.In Part I, teachers Heather and Daniel rehearse kids in a version of Shakespeare’s Dream but mostly bicker amongst themselves while Eartha, a teaching assistant, holds the fort. The bird-watching Nathan drives the advance party of teachers and kids into a ditch.In Part II, those stranded witness an avalanche and have close encounters in a cave, from which they jubilantly emerge. What does it all mean? Who cares. There is no logic to the action which, especially in Part II, seems to have been devised on the hoof. Or the text has been tampered with or snipped. In performance, the children were mere garnish to adult preoccupations.Garth Bardsley’s direction of the children was inept, that of the professionals had them mostly playing straight to the audience – interaction was not the name of his game. During musical interludes requiring activity, the stage remained empty. The show was clearly under-rehearsed.Though the Festival has an honourable history where children and opera are concerned, this year’s offering must be accounted a failure, though I hope the child performers gained something from their involvement.The Daniel bawled his way through the role. The other professionals made a fair showing of McQueen’s eclectic, bitty and rather busy score, which conductor Nicholas Smith negotiated with some panache. Word projection was poor.

The setting is the Scottish court at Edinburgh, the themes are those of love, lust, family honour, deception and integrity.Handel’s genius for characterisation is at its height, the harmonies and shaping of the sometimes lengthy arias digging deep into the emotional and motivational imperatives of the protagonists unsparingly to reveal their inner torments. Ariodante is a mirror unnervingly reflecting audiences’ own unacknowledged transgressions.James Conway’s production is a travesty of the work. Instead of private passions played out in the public arena, he renders it a tale of lechery in a non-conformist seminary, with Ariodante and Polinesso as clergymen rivals for Ginevra’s love. The look is fin de siecle Edvard Munch, the passions grim and claustrophobic.But who are these people? Why do they behave as they do? Conway imbues certain props – a silver tray, a mirror, a seascape – with emblematic significance, has characters handle them significantly and leaves the audience to construe the meaning. His pretentious programme note reveals his intentions but the staging, never.Worse, the Polinesso is a hooting countertenor – not the mezzo Handel wrote for – who carries on like a pantomime villain. It is, frankly, an embarrassment. The other singers struggle gamely to create character out of cardboard.The conducting is lifeless, lacking any sense of architecture. A truly dispiriting experience.

Darker sounds characterised the following dramatic excerpt from Thomas’ Hamlet. Jared Holt made the most – perhaps too much – of his dark-hued vocal colouring, as did Liora Grodnikaite’s Gertrude. Both were dramatically charged.Matthew Rose’s brief offstage performance at the end of this excerpt as the Spectre did not prepare us for his impact as Frere Laurent (Gounod’s Faust) in the following one. His bass has the kind of natural-sounding bloom he should not really have at his age. It is a fine mix of mature richness and youthful robustness.Katie Van Kooten also made a strong contribution here as his Juliette, though her upper range power showed the hint of a distracting vibrato creeping in. In Thomas and Gounod, Liora Grodnikaite’s respective Gertrudes were impressive. Her mezzo is supple yet richly burnished. Matthew Rose continued his show of versatility as Bottom after the interval, drunk with enchantment both vocally and facially. He is surely going to be a welcome and regular presence on our stages.Ha Young Lee also stood out for her light but substantial and agile soprano. Conductor Rory Macdonald (also a Young Artist) proved skilful in extracting Britten’s colourings from the score, but less so in the Merry Wives. With sensitive direction by Andre Heller-Lopes and an entertaining mix of musical styles, this was a thoroughly rewarding evening.

From its humble beginnings as an agricultural farm building, it has been lovingly transformed by its owners, Martin and Lizzie Graham, into an opera venue of the highest quality, complete with ornate chandalier hanging down from the corrugated tin roof.This is the mini Glynebourne experience, which is lapped up by opera buffs from all over the country. Although this particular opera would probably not appear in the top ten of an opera lover’s guide, it has an enduring old fashioned charm about it. Hansel and Gretel – sung by Maria Jagusz and Jane Streeton respectively – comes to life with clear voices and childlike expressions. The pair’s devotion to each other is intensified with the appearance of the witch (sung by Jenny Miller) who is characterised to perfection in an almost pantomime dame costume. The children are soon aware of the witch’s evil intent, even though she keeps feeding them sweets, and they hatch a plan to push her into the oven. Once the deed is done they are reunited with their mother (sung by Tinkue Olafimihan) and father (sung by Henry Newman), the only bass in the cast.An imaginative set design by Jane Bruce makes good use of a small stage but the lighting seems very dark almost all the way through. Wonderful music conducted by Paul McGrath makes it a perfect place to spend a summer’s evening.

Since its first outing in March there has been a trio of cast changes. Pl?cido Domingo now sings Sigmund, German mezzo Waltraud Meier his ‘sister-bride’ Sieglinde and Erik Halfvarson – on his nights off from singing the assassin in Rigoletto – is the raging Hunding.This trio is key to the success of this production. Domingo, fast approaching 65, looks and sounds maybe 20 years younger. Though he may not have the ringing quality up top that he used to, it is still a thrilling performance, regardless of age. He has no complacency of his legendary status and never appears as the star performer.But even his thunder is occasionally stolen by Waltraud Meier’s Sieglinde. Forced into a loveless marriage to Hunding, she is confused and emotionally scarred. Vocally she is richly powerful and utterly compelling – this is unmistakably glorious singing.Halfvarson’s unyielding Hunding is a good match and Rosalind Plowright puts in a finely judged performance as Fricka, despite having to wear a prudish Victorian dress. Bryn Terfel returns as Wotan, not always comfortable theatrically but vocally assured, and Lisa Gasteen’s initially over-flighty Br?nnhilde wins back some honour by the end of Act III.Keith Warner’s production is strewn with distracting images – an all-encompassing curved-steel helix, a length of red rope, Wotan’s pile of books and the Walkyries carrying the skulls of their horses. But Antonio Pappano is a passionate advocate of the score in the pit, where his players work hard.

The narration starts with the animated voices of pianists Philip Headlam (also music director) and Cassie Yukawa, whose monotones on two different pitches create tension from the start. Like the deepening cyclic repetitions found in the work of Harrison Birtwistle – notably The Io Passion, performed at Almeida last year – the story is re-told in different lights. Gradually all the musicians become involved as actors and storytellers. They play, narrate, act, dance and whistle.The instruments themselves – two pianos, two clarinets and bass clarinets, soprano sax and violin – are engagingly used as part of the action. Part of the tale even comes from a ‘talking’ tuba which lies on the floor and is played remotely via a plastic tube. But Aperghis’ music is largely unmemorable of itself, save a haunting chorale-melody towards the end, which spreads in step across the instruments.In keeping with Perrault’s French version – as opposed to other, fluffier versions – the innocent Red Riding Hood is gobbled up by the wolf. The rhyming moral at the end, spoken by all six musicians, starkly warns against little girls trusting strangers and appears somewhat threatening. But otherwise it wouldn’t be a cautionary tale, would it?

In the Handel, Pompey is executed and his head gifted to Caesar. In Mozart’s opera, he has just defeated Mitridate at Pontus.While Mitridate is away in battle, his two sons, Farnace and Sifare, each try to woo Aspasia, their father’s betrothed. As Mitridate angrily unpicks the web of misplaced love and loyalties, he manages to resolve the family conflict but not before mortally wounding himself in the face of defeat by Rome.The tightly formalised convention of the recitative and arias make for stilted action and Graham Vick has decided not to apologise for this. While there is ample interest in terms of stylised movement – especially from the various attendants – there remains an austere naivety of an undeveloped form and along with it a sense of how far stagecraft has developed in the past 250 years.Mozart may have been just 14 when he composed this opera but the demands on the singers are high. Colin Lee’s Marzio began to dry up vocally in the scene where he frees the imprisoned Farnace but is otherwise bold. Bruce Ford in the title role occasionally sounds thin at the top end. But Aleksandra Kurzak makes an impressive Royal Opera debut as Aspasia, sharing her ample power and open sound at high extremes with Susan Gritton’s Ismene. American star counter-tenor David Daniels is clearly a draw for many and he doesn’t disappoint. And Sally Matthews proves a confident, if slightly severe-looking Sifare, whose Act II farewell duet with Daniels is a high-point.

In fact, he has been based in Holland since 1989, where he is well thought of. But this short opera is sure to win him a wide reputation.This joint Aldeburgh/Almeida commission debuted in Suffolk a couple of weeks back, and this was its London premiere. Rozalie Hirs’ libretto is based on one of the children’s tales of Dutch writer Toon Tellegen, set among a group of animals in the forest. It is an operatic tradition most memorably exemplified by Janacek’s The Cunning Little Vixen, and the Czech composer’s style has been a clear influence on Ayres, as has the individually inflected minimalism of his teacher Louis Andriessen.But Ayres produces from these an original mix that has an identity of its own. The adventures of a cricket with a gloomy feeling and an elephant given to climbing trees provide the central figures in this witty work. It is perfectly paced, the orchestral writing is inventive and the piece draws many smiles and a few laughs. It is an undoubted hit and, as a first opera, really rather astonishing.There are delightful touches too in the designs and projections by the Quay Brothers, in Nicholas Broadhurst’s finely judged production, and in some spot-on performances by Claire Wild as the Cricket, Jonathan Gunthorpe as the Elephant, and indeed the entire cast.

Weighty it is not. There is little sense of the shifting panels of history, or of the divided loyalties motivating them. But it is unquestionably a spectacle.The look is consistently brilliant and exotic, from the mechanical waves and ships in the background, to the moonlit garden seduction serenade in Act II, to the lavish use of drapes. Movement director Andrew George must have worked overtime with the cast to engineer a series of camp-funky Indian dance routines, in which Danielle de Niese, making a sensational UK debut, excels. A casting director’s dream, she sings like there is no tomorrow, moves like a pop artist (she apparently trained as a dancer) and oozes sex appeal. For the most part the movement is extremely tight, and the same goes for Ptolemy and Achillas’s brutal handling of Cornelia.The effect is Graham Norton meets Monty Python meets Bollywood, but even if the huge cardboard hand of Pompey seems cheap, the appearance of battleships and then airships in Alexandria harbour at the end is faintly ridiculous.This would all bear little scrutiny without the support of a consistently strong cast. Among them Sarah Connolly’s Caesar is agile if occasionally lacking in colour, Patricia Bardon is a burnished, rich-toned Cornelia and Angelika Kirchschlager is remarkable for her detailed vocal and emotional colouring as Sextus. In the pit, William Christie masterfully presides magnanimously over local detail, broader gestures and large-scale drama.Even if you do not agree with McVicar’s conception, this is a unique and triumphant execution.

Donizetti’s pot-boiling comic melodrama may not demand the same emotional and colouristic range as Puccini’s popular Japanese tragedy, but under Michael Lloyd’s direction the City of London Sinfonia play with greater alertness, sparkle and lyricism.In Annilese Miskimmon’s production the fading facade of an Italian art deco cinema protrudes from the 17th century ruin of Holland House. Nemorino, the lovestruck peasant, is upgraded in status to theatre usher. As he puns on the title of Tristan e Isotta while arranging the letters of the billboard, he reveals his own melancholic private musings. The distance in social status between Nemorino and the wealthy object of his affections, Adina, may not be sharp, but Sean Ruane sings the role with relative ease.It is the love potion from the story of Tristan and Isolde which Nemorino wants, and Donald Maxwell’s charlatan potion peddler Dulcamara is the one to sell it to him. Complete with moustache, bouffant hair and white suit – contrasting with the shocking pink of his amusingly camp assistant – you can practically see the glint from his tooth polish. His patter aria, deliberately on the damp side of crisp, suggests he has been hawking his wares to a town too many.Toby Stafford-Allen’s literally thrusting Belcore makes an ostensible entry by parachute and proceeds to wow the bevy of local beauties. But Judith Howarth is the key weapon in this production. She takes on this taxing role with a thrilling combination of vocal command and risk, equally convincing in wistful lyricism, decorative ornamentation, and explosive attack. There is plenty to enjoy in this production but it is worth going to hear her alone.

The lightning flashes of the opening storm take place within the auditorium as well as onstage and in the heavy-pillared palace hangs a large crucifixion scene. It is an apt image, since both Otello and his wife Desdemona will experience unjust suffering and death. This is matched by strong noises in the pit, where Antonio Pappano relishes both the outright violence and the pained tension of Verdi’s score.With Renee Fleming’s withdrawal for personal reasons from the first two performances, Amanda Roocroft steps in to sing Desdemona. Vocally she sometimes pushes the vibrato too far, but this heroine never loses her dignity despite Otello’s irrational taunts. Her bedroom scene in Act IV, where she utters her final prayers, is truly heart-rending.For his part, Ben Heppner is well cast as the triumphant general, though he occasionally suffers tiredness in the upper vocal reaches. Nevertheless his is a vivid depiction of a powerful man crippled by jealousy. Italian baritone Lucio Gallo is compelling as the evil glue which seals the characters’ fates. He schemes tirelessly but with cool discipline, planting emotional seeds with explosive results. His darkly smooth baritone masks the cutting edge of his actions, rendering him all the more persuasive in his pretence. Robert Lloyd as the Venetian ambassador Ludovico, and Christine Rice as Emilia also give impressive performances.While Verdi’s next (and final) opera, Falstaff, would present more of a merry-go-round, this production clearly marks Otello for the emotional roller-coaster it is.

Though the audience was covered, parts of the stage were thoroughly wet and the noise was deafening. It is much to the credit of the artists that they kept going. Since parts of the second act were practically inaudible, one can only note a few comments on a performance given in the most trying circumstances.It is obvious that D’Arcy Bleiker’s Figaro is an interpretation of some potential, delivered with spark if sung roughly at times. Doreen Curran’s Cherubino is fluently sung, though too feminine for a teenage boy. Sarah-Jane Davies’s Countess takes a while to warm up but she delivers her big second-act aria emphatically, rain or no rain.Emphasis is a little lacking, however, in Julian Tovey’s Count, though he looks the part of the arrogant aristocrat and again demonstrates potential. Lucy Crowe’s Susanna provides an affirmative presence, though her lack of specific moment-by-moment detail is a general fault of John Cox’s production. The traditional sets, by Robert Perdziola, are apt and, in the final garden scene, magical, but what goes on within them needs far more definition.Decent playing from the orchestra – heroic in the circumstances – though Jane Glover’s conducting misses out on the melodic and harmonic contours of Mozart’s score. But the abiding memory is of a company battling through the very worst the weather could throw at them.

Their latest venture is not so sure-footed.Part of the problem is that the Rodgers & Hammerstein classic is so well known on stage and screen that any new version immediately sets up potentially invidious comparisons. It might have been better to pick a more unusual show.The cast is willing and regularly present and correct but none of the central artists has the vocal presence to put their songs over with the requisite panache. Nor do they seem to live their roles from the inside. Craig Urbani lacks the weight and authority to place Emile De Becque at the centre of the emotional scheme and Eliza Lumley’s Nellie Forbush lacks positive personality. Nicola Hughes’s Bloody Mary fields a decent Happy Talk but elsewhere she descends from character into caricature.Getting nearer the mark are John Guerrasio’s Luther Billis and especially Simon Clark’s spot-on Captain Brackett. But too much of Craig Revel Horwood’s direction is out of focus, though his choreography has genuine energy. Nor do the designs really lift the show’s visual temperature.Conductor Richard Balcombe provides an efficient but careful account of what is one of Broadway’s most glamorous scores – though you wouldn’t know it on this occasion.

Ferrando and Guglielmo discuss their fiancees’ faithfulness while changing after a swim and the girls look perfect in pink and blue bouffant dresses and cool heels. For their parts Don Alfonso, the social architect, is suave yet understated and Despina busies about without descending into caricature. So far so good.The singing is never less than good and often much better. Thomas Walker’s Ferrando was impressively powerful but occasionally too much so and he certainly overpushed his ‘un’aura amoroso’. He was a good match for Andrew Conley’s lithe and vibrant Guglielmo. Martina Welschenbach is wonderful as Dorabella, always centred in intonation and with an intrinsic support to the singing but Anna Leese’s Fiordiligi has a little more bloom to the voice, adding a touch more glamour, if also a touch more danger.She also occasionally over-sings, though to more thrilling effect and you could sense her increasing relaxation and enjoyment on the stage develop in front of your eyes. As if that weren’t enough, there is a truly first-class performance from the opera school orchestra. Michael Rosewell, while offering more than a nod to historically informed interpretation, presided over extremely tight but often flamboyant playing, highlighting some of the score’s darker colours.With performances like these the Britten International Opera School is enriching the possibilities available to opera audiences and, at the same time, training some promising future talent.

It is not just that the impoverished artists’ Parisian garret seems implausibly roomy but that the bohemians occupying it clearly feel inhibited while buffooning around what is now a precious 30-year-old set.Gheorghiu herself, now almost 40 – though extremely well preserved – doesn’t convince as the frail, naive seamstress. Her meeting with Rodolfo, sung very capably by Tito Beltran, is too knowing. And though her singing is richly mellifluous, there is a sense of her covering familiar ground in dramatic terms. Even the Christmas Fair scene lacks sparkle, though vocally Angela Maria Blasi’s feisty Musetta manages to light things up.Act III fairs much better, with dramatic exchanges between Mimi and Mariusz Kwiecien’s engaging Marcello, which lead to a surging, climactic quartet sporting vocal horse-power to spare. Back in the garret by Act IV the lads have got more the measure of their frolicking, with a mock feast and after-dinner dancing.But what really makes this performance is the orchestra’s playing, which Mark Elder draws out with loving detail. He carefully teases out inner colours, sharply characterises motifs and deftly handles Puccini’s elastications of tension, frivolity and passion.

Clever and witty, as well as beautifully constructed, they are surely among the best ever seen on the Garsington stage.Fielding’s production too is right out of the top drawer. Arabella used to be criticised as a rerun of Der Rosenkavalier, musically undistinguished and dramatically Mills and Boon territory. That’s not how it comes over here. Instead, we see a subtle and moving comedy of relationships. Fielding finds hidden depths in the piece and explores them with insight and tenderness.Musically, the score is in the safe hands of conductor Elgar Howarth, who shines perceptive lights into all sorts of corners and gives the lyrical highlights real radiance. The orchestra plays marvellously.Between them, director and conductor draw the best out of a strong cast. Orla Boylan’s elegant portrait of the heroine who waits for Mr Right is expertly judged and finely sung. Running her close is Peter Coleman-Wright’s vivid Mandryka, who comes to Vienna from the back of beyond to claim his bride. A few insecurities apart, Cora Burggraaf excels as Arabella’s sister Zdenka while Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts is touching as her confused beau Matteo.There are memorable standouts too from Phyllis Cannan and Stephen Richardson as Arabella’s eccentric parents. But it is a terrific ensemble that really reveals the quality of the piece as rarely before.

But in the theatre, artistic truth counts more than historical truth and the confrontation scene he wrote for the two queens, as included by Donizetti in his opera based on Schiller’s play, can be one of the most thrilling of vocal contests. It is so in Grange Park Opera’s production, due to the presence of two commanding sopranos who here take each other on, no holds barred.Throughout, Janis Kelly sings a purposeful Elizabeth, the monarch’s pride and vulnerability imaginatively realised in both vocal and physical terms.Donizetti allots wonderful lyrical opportunities to Mary Stuart herself and Majella Cullagh seizes them all, giving the music a luminous quality and shaping the lines skilfully. Between them, this regal duo ensures a marvellous evening.But there is positive support from Quentin Hayes as Elizabeth’s canny advisor Cecil, from Jonathan Best as Mary’s supporter Talbot and from Adrian Dwyer as Leicester, whose emotional involvement with both women helps seal Mary’s fate.Stephen Langridge’s production is well directed, though George Souglides’ set for Mary’s prison looks out of period and the opera’s closing tableau is frankly muffed. Chorus and orchestra are strong, though Sergio La Stella’s conducting is no more than efficient, failing to highlight many of the strengths of what is one of Donizetti’s finest scores.

But it’s a balanced reading and Lehnhoff never loses sight of its life-affirming qualities and sheer fun.This is also a rich and stylish musical reading of the most popular of Czech operas. Dietfried Bernet conducts a vigorous, clean-edged account of the score and the London Philharmonic Orchestra plays superbly.Leading the cast are the charming Marenka of Solveig Kringelborn, who lacks edge in the great Act III aria but is engaging throughout, and the Jenik of Julian Gavin, whose voice soars effortlessly up to the top notes and whose smart village lad characterisation is immaculately realised. Equally good are Reinhard Dorn’s canny but ultimately defeated marriage broker Kecal and Wolfgang Ablinger-Sperrhacke’s shy, stuttering Vasek, who touches the heart.Strong standouts from Andrew Shore and Diana Montague as Marenka’s parents and from Frances McCafferty and Alan Fairs as Vasek’s. Andrew Forbes-Lane does a brilliant comedy turn as the Ringmaster of a visiting English circus, while at the piano Duncan Williams’s one-man Dance of the Comedians is a tour-de-force.But it’s a great ensemble. Like Lehnhoff’s three Janacek productions for Glyndebourne, this is destined for classic status and a show not to be missed on any account.

Alasdair Middleton lacks both qualities. His inept staging is also devoid of stagecraft.For the first half hour the chorus, behaving like Tyrolean munchkins, are stuck upstage glued to Bob Bailey’s Advent calendar-like angled flats with cut-out firs, as are Amina, her fianc? Elvino and the Notary when they turn up. The sulking Lisa is tucked away to the side downstage.Thereafter the hapless chorus – how they must long to get back into the action of Holland Park’s Macbeth – spend most of the evening standing around like lemons trying to look animated. Inexplicably, Middleton has them wander through woods wearing night-shirts. The principals do their own thing more or less successfully.The Amina is a cipher. Her command of the vocal line is only adequate, her acting consists of drifting disconsolately around the stage. One wonders what Paul Austin Kelly’s elegant Elvino sees in her. Though his pleasing tenor sounds stretched in alt, he phrases tastefully and almost achieves a three-dimensional characterisation.Tim Mirfin’s Rodolfo is the star. His dark chocolatey bass seamlessly shapes a vital legato line but he needs coaching on how to carry himself onstage. Kate Ladner is the sparky yet devious Lisa.Brad Cohen’s conducting, usually so sound in this repertoire, oscillates between the swooning and the hectic. Deprived of a sustained momentum, the score limps along lumpily. Rapport between pit and stage is often precarious. Not a happy occasion.

Director Olivia Fuchs lays down a clear narrative, solves the troublesome problem of the witches – punk ladettes in aggressive black gear – and elicits hair-raising performances from the Macbeths.Designer Bob Bailey provides a white enclave with trucked metal towers to the sides. Giuseppe di Lorio lights it with harsh, unsparing light. Red trickles down white walls intensify as the murderous duo become steeped in blood. The witches and Banquo’s assassins cling threateningly to the towers, signifying the cage/castle from whose epicentre the feral Macbeths ruthlessly wield power.John Gibbons guides the City of London Sinfonia and the youthful chorus through a impactful reading whose tempos, if at times deliberate, always support the singers. The witches’ interventions pack a menacing punch, while those with the Macbeths establish their passion for each other so destructive to others.Miriam Murphy’s terrifying Lady Macbeth fearlessly negotiates the demanding vocal lines, bringing to them an expressive range of colours and dynamics. Singing always off words, she delivers the second verse of the Brindisi angrily through gritted teeth. Her sleepwalking scene is a harrowing tour de force. Why have the major houses ignored her?Olafur Sigurdarson also impresses, his Macbeth a stocky bundle of restless energy. However, he needs to bring more light and shade to his tireless, at times exhausting, singing. There is more to the role than upfront vocal power. Mark Beesley is the sympathetic Banquo, Leonardo Capalbo the impassioned Macduff.

Tahra Kharibian’s costumes give a recognisable image of the opera’s location and period – provincial Russia and St Petersburg in the 1820s – but Fotini Dimou’s sets are undistinguished and at times anonymous.Within them, the playing out of this subtle tale of a cold man who thaws too late and an impulsive teenage girl who settles for respectable marriage rather than love is variously cliché-ridden or a blank. None of the characters registers as a fully sentient three-dimensional creation. Extraneous matter – such as cutesy kids running around to no discernible purpose – takes the place of searching direction.There are a couple of strong elements. Peter Rose’s Gremin is sung with startling directness, full tone and every word coming over loud and clear. Gerald Finley’s Onegin also makes every word tell – no need for surtitles with these two around – but dramatically he scarcely charts the vital journey between the supercilious snob of the early scenes and the broken figure of the denouement. From an artist such as Finley, this is disappointing.Nor does Catrin Wyn-Davies suggest young Tatyana’s bookish vulnerability. Her tone is sometimes wild and the notes alarmingly non-specific. Gwyn Hughes Jones’s Lensky is vocally tight and dramatically a non-event.Nor does Jonathan Darlington’s conducting connect with the deep emotions and characteristic colours of the score. Like the rest of the show, it is a superficial account of a masterpiece.

A sunny piazza cafe is the setting in which the village beauties vie for the attention of, in this instance, a white-suited, blind, new-age hermit. He is of course, the conniving Count Ory in disguise.Sung by Colin Lee, his light high tenor started out with a slightly rough edge but soon found its lyrical vein, which Lee managed to sustain throughout. Opposite him Juanita Lascarro is the luxuriously cast countess, equally at home with comic acting as with the vocal demands of her role.Dean Robinson, as Ory’s tutor, tends to get caught up in chesty resonance, and Anne-Marie Owens’s Ragonde is rather more fruity than we might have bargained for. But the Croatian baritone Miljenko Turk makes a striking British debut as Raimbaud, combining vocal richness with brilliance, and commanding the stage in his aria following his discovery of the castle’s wine cellar. Victoria Simmonds brings sophisticated, almost understated, dramatic coherence to the role of Isolier, as well as ample vocal flexibility.The faster comic pacing of Act II is palpable, and the drinking song routine with Ory and his men, disguised as nuns, a hit. By comparison, Ory’s mistaken identity assignation with the countess acquires an almost balletic poignancy. David Parry conducts an orchestra of fine professionals, drawing out colourful playing and sensitive accompaniment.

The hedonistic opening orgy establishes the court of the Duke of Mantua as a symbol of anarchy and abuse, with an immature, playboy Duke at its centre.The angled facade of Michael Vale’s set rotates to reveal the interior of the jester Rigoletto’s home, where his preoccupations turn from his courtly performances to the chastity of his daughter, and with the curse set upon him by Monterone. The public and private worlds are sharply defined in the production, yet a darkness pervades all, emphasising that Rigoletto is barely less prescient in the night-time scene when he is blindfolded and duped into abducting his own daughter, than when the blindfold is removed.Paolo Gavanello returns as the black leather-clad, deformed jester of the title role, his hobble barely preventing his scuttling around court. This is a massive role vocally, and his stamina is undiminished throughout. Furthermore, his whole vocal world reflects his unsophistication and vulnerability, never straying into implausible smoothness.Piotr Beczala is a suitably heroic tenor whose childish power is offset only by his ardour for women. And completing the well-cast principal roles are Anna Netrebko’s Gilda, brilliantly sung and effortlessly sustained, and American Eric Halfvarson’s quietly confident assassin Sparafucile. The minor courtiers do not always make their mark and neither does Darren Jeffery’s Monterone, despite cutting an imposing figure, but this barely damages the compelling drama. Edward Downes returns to elicit strong and detailed playing from the Royal Opera Orchestra.

Recit is cut back, the scene of Masetto’s beating-up is so reduced it barely registers, Zerlina loses her subsequent aria ‘Vedrai, carino’ and Elvira’s ‘Mi tradi’ is butchered nonsensically. All of which is unacceptable at a festival but presumably obviates paying overtime.Francis O’Connor’s setting has a shattered mirror as ceiling, Chris Davey’s murky lighting design creating criss-crosses of scintillating light which continually obscure the players. Furniture comprises odd chairs and a Last Supper table on a revolve.Sepulchral, non-singing extras in 18th-century gear sit at the long table and manoeuvre props. So, no companions for Zerlina’s and Masetto’s betrothal celebrations, no peasantry at Giovanni’s bash to reflect the irony of his ‘Viva la libert?’.During the Overture Giovanni weds then tups Elvira and has sex with a consenting Anna, whom he promptly dumps. Is that why she pretends not to recognise Giovanni once into the action, resists Ottavio’s amorous appeals but sets him on to avenge her ‘rape’?There is no descent into hell at the finale. Instead, Elvira stabs the Don for the ghostly Commendatore, then joins the remaining protagonists, who swagger on as Grange Park audience surrogates and tuck roisteringly into their picnics.The singing is mediocre to dreadful, the acting coarse to bland. Stefan Solyom conducts a reading which does some justice to Mozart’s glorious score. Otherwise, it’s disgraceful farrago.

Each scene is revealed through a different rectangular opening in the black curtain which covers the front of the stage. It is a trick which allows for a real sense of the claustrophobia of the setting, focusing on each successive scene, making each distinct from the next, but also giving the idea of a constricting warren of a prison from which escape only comes in the final triumphant exodus.If the set is compact and minimal – with a similar lighting design which only enhances the changing moods of the opera – there is nothing of that about the singing itself. Director Tim Albery has identified the physical minutiae which is universal and timeless about any totalitarian regime, and allowed Beethoven’s music to breathe and soar the full range of its emotion within these confines. It is at once particular and at the same time universal.At the core of the evening, Ian Storey gives a magnificent rendition of the prisoner, Florestan, with a voice which is as big and noble as it should be. But the real delight comes in the way in which the whole piece is set up – the domesticity of  Sarah Redgwick’s clearly and lightly sung Marzelline, with Ulrich Dunnebach’s forceful Rocco and Colin Judson’s rather wheedling Jaquino.Elizabeth Byrne starts well as Leonore but in such a freely flowing production her voice sounds tight at the top of her range.

Its source is an 18th century play by Carlo Gozzi, whose fairytale world also inspired Turandot and The Love for Three Oranges. Indeed, the story is a sequel to Prokofiev’s brilliant comedy.Anyone who knows Dove’s more recent opera Flight will be familiar with the style of this piece, which is influenced by John Adams and Stephen Sondheim. It is an agreeable blend and Dove’s orchestration for 13-piece ensemble is immaculate but his pacing is uncertain. There is a good deal of plot to get through before the happy ending, and the three acts feel long, with some of the ideas being too often repeated.Still, it provides opportunities for a large and busy cast, though it is unclear where the action of Martin Lloyd-Evans’s production takes place – the storeroom basement of a museum, perhaps, in Dick Bird’s set.It is an ensemble piece, with no real standouts, though everyone undertakes his or her role with credit, except in respect of diction, which is poor. This is an absolutely vital skill for students, whatever language they’re singing in – English on this occasion.The best element of the evening is the confident playing of the band under the always assured baton of Dominic Wheeler.

The pantomimic aspect is not awkwardly self-conscious, nor is the music hall technique of connecting with the audience, while the continual opening and shutting of doors introduces an element of French farce.In this first new production of The Magic Flute by WNO in 26 years, the atmosphere, while paying due attention to the solemn themes of honesty, duty, courage and love, is lightened warmly by its Magritte-inspired appearance. The costume designs by Kevin Pollard provide constant delight and there are excellent visual jokes, including an attack by a vicious giant lobster, three boys on aerial bicycles and some quite delightful animals. Sarastro’s priests, gaily suited, bowler-hatted, umbrella-sporting – an all-Orange Order literally – are a joy, poking their heads through trapdoors in the floor whenever cabinet opinions are required.As Papageno, Teddy Tahu Rhodes is outstanding, an exotic and loony cowardy custard, a comic portrayal to savour. Peter Wedd and Rebecca Evans combine stylishly as Tamino and Pamina, though at times overshadowed by the visual effects. As the Queen of the Night, Katarzyna Dondalska finds it hard to make the necessary impact, while Brindley Sherratt in satisfying voice shows assured authority as Sarastro.Jean-Yves Ossonce conducts a finely balanced account of this sublime score, filling the huge Donald Gordon auditorium, answering those who feared loss of intimacy. This English version by Jeremy Sams works well in the dialogue, though too much of the lyrics, especially with the female singers, is lost – which of course does not happen when the company’s admirable surtitle service enlightens foreign language operas.

The production’s sole flaw is to have jettisoned Mozart’s choruses without so much as a by your leave. That’s really not on in a major opera company.The rest is intelligent and witty, especially as played by this classy cast. Gregory Turay’s Ferrando suffers from mottled tone but is attractively sung and acted. Mark Stone – whose addition to the company has proved a real boost – is a canny and likeable Guglielmo.As their lovers, Cara O’Sullivan is funny and ebullient as Fiordiligi and also sings heroically – her Per pieta is a true highlight. Anne Marie Gibbons is equally precise and personable as Dorabella.But it’s the two manipulators of this refined yet painful comedy of the human heart that win the most tricks. Robert Poulton’s savvy, seen-it-all Alfonso is a joy, while Lillian Watson remains the most stylish Despina around today. They and the rest of the cast see to it that much of Jeremy Sams’s clever translation bounces out into the auditorium.The gifted young conductor Edward Gardner is at the helm. Though his tempi are occasionally on the fast side, which doesn’t always allow Mozart’s notes to register clearly, he maintains an exhilarating sense of momentum on this highly enjoyable musical journey.

It was a transcendent occasion.Richard Farnes led the orchestra through a sumptuous reading of Ravel’s glittering score, the rhythmic drive achieving Bacchic abandon. Kevin Gowland’s effortlessly relaxed flute-playing in Pantomime was unnervingly erotic.No surprise, therefore, that Farnes and his forces delivered an impassioned, deeply resonant reading of Bartok’s extraordinary masterpiece, for it is the orchestra which realises the agonised sighs and groans of Bluebeard’s castle, which reveals the protagonists’ inner states in orchestration of refinement, subtlety and power.Hungarian conductors tend to move the piece more but Farnes’ firm grip on the work’s architecture meant that his steadier revelation of its psychological complexities was no less profound.Giles Havergal’s semi-staging allowed the protagonists to move effectively and discreetly. Aisles led to a playing area between the string section and wind band, above which an angled screen carried abstract projections, implying the inner meanings behind the closed doors of the castle.As Judith and Bluebeard, Sally Burgess and John Tomlinson generated an emotional intensity which riveted the audience spellbound to their seats. Both put across words with exemplary clarity, gave shape and meaning to the vocal line and thrillingly inhabited character with a telling understatement. It was sheer perfection.

With the audience seated on opposite sides of the proscenium arch, the central performing space rises and falls to offer a multi-layered view of events, based on Jean Cocteau’s classic 1950 movie.It is a world of ambiguity and mystery, tellingly recreated in Francisco Negrin’s production. At its source is the age-old myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, refracted through Cocteau’s highly personal version and then refracted again through Glass’s distinctive score.Glass devotees will revel in its sustained repetitions, though his detractors will be bored. But in this work, more than in previous scores, Glass rises to a couple of scenes – one set in the Zone, the kingdom of death, the other the close of the piece, when the poet and his wife resume their life together – that are harmonically memorable and even melodic. The rest is the Glass mixture as before.But all in all a worthwhile venture for the Royal Opera, though musically things are not as precise under conductor Rory Macdonald as they deserve to be. There are vocal uncertainties too. But Ha Young Lee fascinates as the enigmatic Princess, Jared Holt works hard and to some effect as Orphee and both Katie van Kooten as Eurydice and Andrew Kennedy as Heurtebise are confident.

After ten years Stuart has finally completed his radical treatise on the effect of homosexuality on Nikolai Gogol. Before he posts his work off he has to prepare dinner for a rather unexpected date with his window cleaner. As if his procrastination can become any more laboured, he decides to watch, once again, his video recording of the 1969 Eurovision Song Contest.Each one of these influences may be cause to a mass of camp humour but Luscombe wisely steers clear of this as Stuart’s story is one that takes him into desperation and finally madness. Duncan Wisbey is a superlative performer, able to generate all the excitement and anticipation of the contest in the guise of Dutch entry, Lenny Kuhr, while easily slipping into other, more menacing personae such as Gogol’s manservant or, perhaps more telling, the character of Gogol’s Diary of a Madman. Wisbey also performs excerpts from many of the entrants, gives a rendition of Kuhr’s De Troubadour number in perfect Dutch, and, as the communist Kuhr, swipes a few well-timed bon-mots at British arrogance and Lulu’s entourage.This production encapsulates as perfect a balance of tragi-comedy as can possibly be achieved. The song contest offers the opportunity for laughter and tension while the real human tragedy of Stuart’s pathetic, doomed existence is skilfully intertwined with the death of the Ukrainian writer.Ê

It is also wonderfully conducted by Sir Charles Mackerras, who manages to combine dynamism with flexibility in a performance that benefits greatly from the period colours of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment. The music flows and the production flows with it.American tenor Eric Cutler’s bright, forward tone aids him in the presentation of a winning Tamino, and Lisa Milne’s warm lyricism matches him nicely as Pamina. Canadian soprano Aline Kutan lacks some presence as the Queen of the Night but she has all the notes. As Sarastro, German bass Alfred Reiter supplies both notes and presence.In secondary roles, Robert Lloyd sings an unusually dignified Speaker, Wolfgang Ablinger-Sperrhacke is a vivid Monostatos, and Claire Ormshaw misses not a trick as Papagena.But Mozart’s librettist, the actor/writer/singer Emanuel Schikaneder, certainly knew what he was doing when he wrote the role of Papageno for himself. To really succeed it needs, as well as the highest acting skills and vocal finesse, the ability to connect with the audience. Christopher Maltman has it all, and his command of comedy, humanity and pathos is complete. This exceptional baritone impresses more with every performance, but this is his finest achievement so far. He steals the show – and it is a very good show to steal.

Fortunately, Peter Hall takes the piece seriously. The comedy mostly arises naturally from the action allowing the music’s restless, at times haunting, subtext to really tell.Vladimir Jurowski’s conducting of the London Philharmonic makes doubly sure. Crystalline textures, rhythmic verve and an almost impeccable pacing propel the drama towards its enigmatic conclusion with a compelling urgency. Only occasionally does he unnecessarily push tempos to the limit.However, there is the distinct feel that Jurowski is reining in the score’s inner energy, smoothing out its rawer elements, its harsher insights. Similarly, Hall’s unfolding of the narrative may seem to probe deep the harsh inequities of a dysfunctional family, to lay bare social greed and envy, love and hatred, but the effect is nondescript.That the input of two such heavyweights results merely in an untaxing evening’s entertainment is the result, I fear, of lightweight casting. Nathan Berg’s sonorous Alidoro excepted, the voices are small-scale while there is little welly to the acting. Cenerentola needs stronger performers to reveal its painful truths.The ladies cope best, with Ruxandra Donose a spirited Cenerentola, though runs are sometimes smudged. Raquella Sheeran and Lucia Cirillo are the credibly unlovable Clorinda and Tisbe.Maxim Mironov’s weedy Don Ramiro fields a tremulous high tenor, Simone Alberghini’s sober Dandini a rather unfocused baritone. The Don Magnifico mugs and barks like a provincial Italian buffo. Settings and costumes are conventional period, Peter Mumford’s lighting distractingly twitchy.

It is a serious attempt to stage Handel’s Biblical oratorio about an Israelite leader who swears that if he is victorious in battle he will sacrifice the first living thing he meets on his return. This proves to be his daughter Iphis and after much lamenting and wailing, the sacrifice is averted only by angelic intervention.Worthy though the attempt is, it fails on a number of counts. Handel’s oratorios were not designed to be staged and their structure is essentially non-theatrical. Mitchell’s busy direction of both principals and chorus underlines rather than disguises this fact.Though Vicki Mortimer’s swiftly changing set – a war-damaged hotel, with the cast dressed in late forties gear – is a brilliant piece of work, the period is not one associated with ritual human sacrifice. No two people I spoke to had the same opinion as to where the staging is set. This story could only make sense in the setting of an ancient, deeply religious culture.The singers work hard but they compromise Handel’s lines with shouting, as if this were a verismo barnstormer. His music would have more impact if simply and carefully sung. Some of the voices are small scale for London’s largest theatre and diction is woefully poor.Nor is Nicholas Kraemer’s conducting inspiring. ENO’s policy of staging oratorios needs serious reconsideration.

But the proof of the pudding is in the eating.1984 turned out to be indigestible. Orwell’s classic novel is a worthwhile subject, a fine cast had been assembled and the strong production was the work of Robert Lepage. The show had everything going for it, in fact, except the score.Despite Maazel’s long experience conducting all kinds of repertoire, he has failed to come up with music of any real quality. He knows how to write for orchestra and chorus – though even these parts of the work lack individuality – but his writing for voices is woefully dull and under-characterized. Musically, this is a long, thin and depressingly tedious evening.The cast did their best in trying circumstances. Simon Keenlyside was predictably superb as Winston Smith, Nancy Gustafson made her mark as Julia and Richard Margison consistently impressed as the sinister O’Brien.The German coloratura Diana Damrau and American bel canto tenor Lawrence Brownlee made some impact in smaller roles.But the piece was a dismal flop. Despite all the world premiere razzmatazz, there were a couple of boos for Maazel at curtain time – unheard-of for a living composer at this venue.

As usual, their selection of scenes was finely prepared and nicely served up, with imaginative designs by Conor Murphy, inventive lighting by Bruno Poet and stylish conducting by Roy Laughlin.Only John Fulljames’s direction was erratic. In a couple of extracts – from Don Giovanni and Idomeneo in particular – the young artists seemed to have little idea who they were, and when silent in particular they trod water. But Fulljames did well with the big ensemble scenes from A Midsummer Night’s Dream and Cosi.On the whole, there were fewer remarkable singers than in the last two years, with several needing to work on fairly basic matters – like singing in tune, as someone said to me in the interval. But a number impressed with their achievement or at least potential. Soprano Rejieli Paulo has a magnificent instrument not yet under full control. Nor was Martene Grimson’s lighter voice, though she had some lovely moments as Humperdinck’s Gretel.Amongst those impressing with honed skills were Karina Lucas as Hansel and Mozart’s Idamante, Eleni Voudouraki as Aurelio in Donizetti’s L’assedio di Calais, Sinead Campbell as Britten’s Helena, and Ed Lyon, especially as Britten’s Earl of Essex. It is going to be fascinating to see how these young artists develop as they make their way into the profession.

Despite its references to The Tempest, its destylised everyday-life setting brought a strong sense of immediacy. While the subjects of black and gay liberation may not now seem as pressing, that of war and peace, centring around the tortured freedom-fighter Denise, remains as central as ever.Emphasising the currency of Tippett’s work, Music Theatre Wales’s touring production features a video installation commissioned from Jane and Louise Wilson – projected on to two moveable screens on the stage – which features images of the decaying concrete construction of Victor Pasmore’s Apollo Pavilion in Peterlee, County Durham, as well as film taken in Kew Gardens. While this effectively reflects Tippett’s impression of ‘a labyrinth or rose-garden’, the rapid alternation of the video images can be distracting.In this chamber version of the opera, re-orchestrated by Meirion Bowen, Michael Rafferty conducts a strong ensemble cast. Helen Field is a passionate and disturbed Denise, though while her stamina is impressive throughout her shattering Act I outburst, her vocal power is less impactful.For the rest, Elizabeth Watts sings a sweet Flora, while Christopher Lemmings and Rodney Clarke draw out the frolics and the pain of their gay relationship. Gwion Thomas is an insightful Faber and Lucy Schaufer sings his wife Thea with breathtaking resolve. As Mangus, the analyst and MC, Jeremy Huw Williams is dramatically confident, if suffering from a whiff of camp smugness.

She wants to fill its empty rooms with European glitterati and, in a (successful) attempt to entice her to remove his belt with her teeth, her lover the Secretary of Culture dreams up the lie that he has discovered a lost opera. Its production will surely bring the required visitors.In farce, such lies grow of their own volition. And under Peter Clerke’s direction the growth is both organic and entertaining. Sean Hay, as the weak-willed Secretary, sets it out perfectly. His entanglement with Rocio Galan’s by turns acerbic and tempestuous Madam Stosslova is a suitable back drop. Maria Oller creates new layers of complexity as his wife, journalist Ludmila Kutuzovna who has her own plans for the news.Providing a constant soundtrack on the cello is the mute Alexei (Robin Mason) in whose head the opera appears to reside. As both plot and La Ronde of love affairs thicken, artistic benefactor Milinka Yeletsky – a not quite dramatic enough Catherine Gillard – and poet Ratmir Goryanshikov (Stewart Ennis), vie to control Alexie.Small countries with pretensions to big opera are not unknown to Scottish audiences. Yet while the infighting, intrigue and lack of finance which come with the territory are well parodied here, the resolution is too laboured to be comfortable. Deceptively simple design by Iain Halket and effective music by Pete Livingstone keep everything tight, but the production’s expected killer punch simply fails to materialise.

Sung in English, it is enthralling because it is not only a vehicle for the great singing talents of the cast but is a masterpiece of production, designed to tour and be performed on smaller stages as well as standard.Make no mistake, there is no variation from tradition but there are some very clever effects, including singing puppets and fibre optic brooms. Let nothing detract from the singing though. As Hansel and Gretel, Jennifer Johnston and Claire Wild are superb – there is no other word for it. Miranda Keys had her work cut out as both their mother and the witch but rose to the challenge.Also with two roles was Rebecca Bottone, faultless as the Sandman and the Dew Fairy, and among the girls was an excellent performance by baritone Roland Wood as Peter, the children’s father. Further interest is created by the inclusion of children from local schools. Scottish Opera’s policy of taking productions on tour to the small as well as large venues does not mean they are short-changing on the live music.A great 19-piece orchestra conducted by Derek Clark is the icing on a very exciting and memorable operatic cake. This is how opera was intended. It is a production for the people, superb value and a lot of fun.

The orchestra plays the difficult score marvellously and Daniel steers the piece along with authority.Richard Jones’ 2002 production once again looks impressive, with an inventively created modern setting, top-drawer costumes from Buki Shiff and skilful lighting by Pat Collins. The work’s wide range of society and the complexity of the central characters and their relationships are fascinatingly drawn.Leading the show in all senses is Lisa Saffer’s award-winning interpretation of Lulu herself, who draws the rest of the cast with her sexual magnetism and is eventually murdered by Jack the Ripper. Both vocally and physically, Saffer’s creation will long be recalled as near ideal.Robert Hayward’s Dr Schon is solidly delivered, while Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts shows us the vulnerability of his besotted son, Alwa. Susan Parry gives a good account of Countess Geschwitz, Lulu’s most loving admirer, and Gwynne Howell is present and correct as the mysterious Schigolch. Further strong performances come from Anna Burford as the Schoolboy, and Graeme Danby, Robert Poulton, Alan Oke and Richard Coxon, all doubling or even tripling up in various roles.A remarkable company achievement, then, adding up to much more than the sum of its parts, and a fine realisation of one of the most powerful of all operas.

Caringly judged dynamics assist singers to mould and give meaning to vocal lines. Ballo’s novel and exhilarating blend of comedy and tragedy is held in perfect balance. Marvellous!Sadly, the revival of Mario Martone’s botched staging fails to live up to Sir Charles’ visionary conducting. Martone updates the Boston version, never satisfactory, to the Civil War period, though no one would guess from Sergio Tramonti’s disparate settings, ranging from the skimpy to the emptily spectacular.Stagecraft is primitive, as in the opening scene of Act III. Where it takes place is uncertain, the cast often handle props without motivation, while furniture-shifting flunkies disrupt the concluding quintet.The excellent cast is left to create character on the hoof. Result? Dmitri Hvorostovsky’s Renato crudely chews the scenery during ‘Eri tu’ and thereafter, Robert Gleadow hams it as the conspirator Samuel. Stephanie Blythe, singing superbly, barely rescues Ulrica from the nondescript. Patrizia Biccire can do little with the page Oscar.However, Richard Margison and Nina Stemme bring a third dimension to Riccardo and Amelia. And all the principals sing Verdi’s soaring melodies with firm centred tone and warm phrasing. Musically the evening is a triumph.

Siegfried as a frontiersman ensconced in domestic bliss with his homemaking bride Brunnhilde gives way to a Rhine journey that sees him skateboarding through canyons on the way to New York.The Gibichung Hall is a health spa that maintains a private army complete with missiles. How all this fits together is an unanswered question, but at least this time around you have definitely seen a show.Neither Berkeley-Steele’s superhero nor Kathleen Broderick’s redemptive heroine is ideal but they battle their way bravely through their near-impossible vocal tasks.As the dark-souled Hagen, Gidon Saks does much more. With resourceful singing and brilliant acting he offers the production’s star turn.Solid and creditable performances from Claire Weston as blonde bombshell Gutrune, Iain Paterson as her easily manipulated brother Gunther and a committed Waltraute from Sara Fulgoni. Andrew Shore adds hallucinatory presence as Alberich.It is still not certain whether complete cycles will be given of this uneven Ring but meanwhile, this final segment can be recommended as well worth catching.

And now the Danish company’s new waterfront opera house – a bulbous glass fronted 1,500-seat theatre, opened in January – presents this, Ruders’s latest opera, as its first new commission.‘Proces Kafka’ is based on Kafka’s bleak, best-known book but also interweaves the real-life scenario of the author’s relationships with Felice Bauer – who later became his wife – and her best friend Greta Bloch in the form of sung letters, which reveal Kafka as self-centred, needy and vacillating, with scenes from The Trial.Francisco Negrin’s production employs towering bookcases topped with spinning clocks to capture the hum-drum office life of the novel’s Joseph K, clearly here representing Kafka himself. Against this, the characters of the book are highlighted with distractingly surreal brushstrokes – an eagle-headed Inspector, clowned-up warders, the court painter on stilts.Ultimately the trial of the opera’s title is more to do with Kafka’s real-life confrontation with Bauer and Bloch in a Berlin hotel room once the writer’s duplicity had been exposed, than with the unsettling non-trial of the book. But Ruders’s strongly coloured and well-crafted score, conducted by Thomas Sondergard, drives the action ever onwards and Johnny van Hal, on stage throughout as Kafka/Joseph K, gives a sterling if occasionally underpowered performance. Gisela Stille as Bauer and Gert Henning-Jensen in the triple role of the Inspector, Trial Judge and Court Painter sing with flair and agility.It is an ambitious work and not without its problems but it is a strong early bid in establishing Copenhagen’s new house on the international operatic map.

But that doesn’t stop the enterprising University College Opera from staging it. In this incarnation of the tale, Whittington leaves London by Greenwich to escape the law. His ship is destroyed off the coast of Bambouli, and it is here that Whittington’s cat removes a rat infestation – though the Bamboulis are a cannibal people, they happen to fear rats. Dick saves his skin and returns to London to claim his Alice and the Mayor’s seat. leaving behind the dejected Bambouli princess.The libretto is inordinately sprawling and seriously unwitty. And while it might have stood up better in its own time, a review of the first performance, on Boxing Day 1784, referred to the text as “the very worst I have heard enunciated within the walls of this theatre”.Thus said, this is a fine production made on a naturally tight budget. Not all of the student roles are entirely successful, although Josie Eccles’ Mrs Merton-esque Dorothy sings attractively and has a sure comic presence, while Aaron Peter makes a suitably hunky Chief Moonshi. Lara Martins, Bruce Graham and Mark Richardson, as a bright Princess, a perfectly pantoed Fitzwarren and childlike King of Bambouli, also make good professional contributions.Charles Peebles and the University College Opera Orchestra offer a sprightly, disciplined yet carefully phrased rendering of a one-dimensional score which offers little in terms of pacing or emotion-painting.In all, a novel success, though if London has to wait another 220 years for Whittington’s next performance, then c’est la vie.

Young soldiers are still being rushed to dangerous trouble spots.Betty Comden’s and Adolph Green’s straightforward narrative accommodates both short, pithy scenes and mini-ballets that distil the spirit of New York: all girders, fire-escapes and steam in Robert Jones’ evocative settings. A pity Mark Henderson’s rather Stygian lighting fails to mirror the sunrise to sunset trajectory of Gaby’s troubled search for Miss Turnstiles.Bernstein’s explosive score, a fusion of classical and jazz forms, positively exudes pizzazz yet is insightful about loneliness in Lonely Town, and experiential loss in Some Other Time – surely two of the most perfect songs ever penned. Conductor Simon Lee deftly delivers the score’s heady delights.Jude Kelly directs with admirable simplicity, organising the crowd/chorus effectively to reflect the Big Apple’s restless energy. I wish she had pruned the Carnegie Hall Pavane and Pitkin’s song, I Understand – neither sequence is memorable. Stephen Mear’s choreography, though fluent, only digs deep in the Lonely Town sequence.The sole opera singer with a lead role is Lucy Schaufer, the volatile, sensationally sung Claire de Loone, which hardly makes a successful fusion of opera and music theatre performers. Chorus and dancers meld well though. Caroline O’Connor is a winningly predatory Hildy, Sylvia Sims a hilariously bibulous Madame Dilly.Of the three sailors, Adam Garcia’s Chip is rather ordinary, Aaron Lazar’s Gaby likeable but only Tim Howar’s cute Ozzie is a total success.

It is a complex tale, told clearly and succinctly in William Relton’s intelligent staging, which also boasts an elegant set and costumes by Roy Bell.On the whole, the women impress the most. Both Elizabeth Watts as Fulvia and Anna Grevelius as the Emperor’s sister Onoria command the techniques to do the music justice and create solid characterisations. With less to do, Greek bass George Matheakakis once again impresses with his security and stagecraft.The others – Philip Viveash’s Emperor, Tim Mead’s Ezio and Eamonn Mulhall’s villainous Massimo – all struggle a bit, though each of them has a promising voice and some stage ability. But they have been thrown in right at the deep end with Handel’s ornate and exposed writing.Laurence Cummings conducts an adept London Handel Orchestra, who play throughout with attractive tone colours.

The minimalist Japanese house with plain sliding walls, the traditional costumes sharply differentiating the Japanese from the American – these form the skeleton of a straight production. But the changing backdrops, with designs by Christian Fenouillat, create a discontinuous sense of style and place, opening with a detailed but flat photographic view of Nagasaki harbour and continuing with a child-like block painting of green fields, blue sky and pink cherry blossom.When the Bonze storms the wedding to disown Butterfly, the painted bakdrop falls down flat and is trampled. Plain back lighting after this confirms that Butterfly’s exterior world, after turning her back on her religion and family, has effectively been removed.But the most unusual and remarkable element of this production is Cristina Gallardo-Domas’s Cio-Cio San with her neurotic hand wringing and haunted facial expressions. This crumbling of Japanese poise and her outward emotion could almost be another step in the assimilation of her American husband’s culture. Vocally it’s a strongly inhabited performance, sometimes marred by affected swooping and not singing down to the note, but her stamina are presence are striking.Stephen O’Mara, filling in for Marco Berti as Pinkerton, equals Gallardo-Domas’s abandon, leading to an Act I love duet which leaps off the stage. With impressive performances too from Chrstine Rice’s rich-toned Suzuki, Alasdair Elliott’s brilliantly enunciated Goro and John Bernays’s aristocratic Yamadori, it is a powerful evening. Israeli conductor Daniel Oren’s draws strong emotional intensity from the Royal Opera orchestra, with the ability to repeatedly turn the entire ensemble on a sixpence.

But then, they are not often asked to become part of the Vole Patrol, marching off to the beat of the drum with Ronnie Simon’s friendly but authoritative hare, Sergeant George, to learn a tune, harmony and rhythm and save Auntie Janet’s woodland home from the bulldozers.This is what you might call total opera. Rehearsed, to a certain extent, by several previous readings of a short book about how Auntie Janet (a hen) set up a hotel for homeless animals in the wood, a class of young primary school children is read a new story about Janet. A few sentences in, the story comes to life as George knocks on the door and leads them off to see the hotel for themselves. There they meet Auntie Janet, in the near pantomime dame shape of Chris Duffy, and Alyson Orr’s rather too blandly aloof bat Madame Pipistrelle.But with the bulldozers fast approaching Janet has soon sent everyone on, together with flautist and music director Marion Christie’s song thrush Mavis, to search for a magic song.If this is still a distance away from the very best children’s theatre, it does use some of the best techniques and ideas of children’s television to tell librettist Mark Robertson’s story. Kelvin Guy’s set is easy to believe in and the puppets used to teach each part of the song are smoothly incorporated. Indeed, the whole works well on all levels.

So it proved a night of celebration for the now 250-strong professional world-class company, with perennial favourite Dennis O’Neill rising thrillingly to the challenges of feckless seducer Turiddu and tragic clown Pagliacci.Elijah Moshinsky’s 1996 stagings are revived with surety of touch by Robin Tebbutt, while Michael Yeargan’s designs provide visual emphasis to the contrasts inherent in these works. For the first, there is a realistic Sicilian village square of the 1880s. For the second, a featureless space in post-war Italy for the motorised band of Commedia dell’Arte players and circus performers in which to present their pathetic show.The Santuzza of Marianna Tarasova is a passionate portrayal of cruel abandonment, so moving in her desperation, with effective support from Susan Gorton as Mamma Lucia and Claire Bradshaw as Lola. Jason Howard as the arrogant cuckold Alfio is swaggeringly self-assured but seen to better effect as the malignant Tonio. His prologue is memorable, a fitting foretaste of his scream of triumph that the comedy is over as the curtain descends on the double killing.Delphine Gillot is a suitably flighty Nedda, with Pavel Baransky as Silvio and Philip Lloyd Holtam as Beppe providing strong support.

Aideen Malone lights discreetly. Costumes are period.Most refreshing is Timothy Walker’s direction of the text. The narrative is crystal clear, while the many exchanges, the interplay of character, and the moments of inner revelation cohere cumulatively to expose the consequences of emotional hyperbole, of love in a vacuum, of youthful arrogance.The singers play well together to create a purposive ensemble, despite some vocal weaknesses and histrionic limitations. However, no doubting the star quality of Amanda Echalaz’s subtly observed Fiordiligi, whose gleaming soprano surmounts every vocal hurdle with power and sensitivity. ‘Come Scoglio’ was mettlesome and moving.Rachel Nicholls has all Dorabella’s notes but the vocal and histrionic personality is hard-edged and cool. She fluffs the transition from intransigence to surrender, despite Walker having set up the process in Act I with her very physical farewell to Ferrando.Gardar Thór Cortes finds Ferrando’s ardour and seriousness but his warm tenor won’t always respond technically to his intentions. The Guglielmo is a dull dog with intonation problems.Andrew Slater is the wise and experienced Don Alfonso, Amy Freston a delightfully together Despina, who has a winning way with words and music. Robert Dean conducts a crisp, clean-textured reading.

I await Brunhilde’s awakening in Siegfried (“Hail, bright sun”) with interest.Warner’s methodology becomes clear. Fill the stage picture with a pick ‘n’ mix plethora of emblematic clues for the audience to make of them what it will. This is either lazy direction or intellectual arrogance, or both.Meanwhile a fine cast, singing strongly off words, emote like characters in a Fay Weldon melodrama on commercial TV. Earthlings and gods are temperamentally indistinguishable, presumably exemplifying the philosopher Feuerbach’s contention that mankind creates gods in its own image.Still, Katarina Dalayman and Jorma Silvasti, as Sieglinde and Siegmund, make impassioned siblings. Stephen Milling is an unnervingly vicious Hunding, Lisa Gasteen a radiant Brunhilde, despite a hideous frock. Bryn Terfel’s Wotan is a cipher – that is Warner’s doing.Antonio Pappano’s stop-go conducting dismantles the score’s architecture and undermines its natural momentum.

Commissioned by the San Carlo, Naples, for the 1834 season, the staging was bedevilled by the feuding of the rival divas singing Mary and Elizabeth I, then banned by the King of Naples the day after the dress rehearsal.It is a fine piece which hasn’t deserved its years of neglect. It requires two technically assured singers who can act to embody the opposing queens. Director James Conway is fortunate in having Anne Mason and Jennifer Rhys-Davies.Both sensitively sing off words, Mason shaping Mary’s music with a sure feel for its legato lines and subtle dynamics, Rhys-Davies encompassing Elizabeth’s wide-ranging ‘fioriture’ with meaningful ease. The highly charged meeting of the duo is hair-raising, while Mason’s delivery of the confessional ‘Quando di luce rosea’ is a model of style and restraint.They carry the evening, finely supported by Noel Davies and the ETO orchestra. Davies conducts a rhythmically alive reading which realises the more tender moments with empathetic clarity and compassion. He draws a hushed intensity from chorus and orchestra in the moving ‘Oh truce apparato!’, which launches the opera’s final scene.The men are not in the same league. Nicholas Ransley is a wooden Leicester, his pleasing tenor needing more colours to it, more bloom to the tone. The Talbot sings at a relentless forte and so does the Cecil, who is also guilty of fuzzy intonation.Conway achieves a clear narrative line within Soutra Gilmour’s skeletal setting evocatively lit by Aideen Malone. Well worth catching.

And as the orchestra provide the long overture with a rather pinched performance, it would be even easier to write the whole thing off as a disaster.How wrong that would be. As Lisa Milne, singing Semele, petulantly casts her score to the floor and the chorus look on in bemusement, it begins to look promising. And by the end of Act I, when the voluptuous Semele is lifted out of sight on a huge pillow, holding her arms out to Jupiter and singing “Endless pleasure, endless love, Semele enjoys above,” you are certain that she is. More to the point, so are you as her voice is perfect for the florid excesses of the part.Director John La Bouchardiere’s vision is to provide the godly goings on as a sort of entertainment for the mortal chorus. A black, reflective-floored stage with screens and projections behind, designed and lit by Guiseppe di Iorio, provides an arena for the gods. And Magali Gerberon’s huge-hipped costumes are big enough to fill this void, often spectacularly so.On the singing front, the improvement of a dramatic interpretation over a concert one is clearly demonstrated. Michael George’s Somnus, for example, can be somnambulant in all ways, or Susan Bickley’s Juno truly vicious as she pimps out the nymph Pasithea (Isabelle Woywode) to him. Brilliant entertainment.

But given a small theatre, a sympathetic production and a conductor with a sense of style, it can deliver an enchanting evening.It does so here in this smart but warm-hearted staging by Ian Rutherford that updates the action to the time of the work’s premiere (1899) and boasts some aptly flouncey costumes and delightful period touches from designer John Clarke. Jenny Weston arranges the choreography neatly and the show takes to the air.It also gives a very good impression of current vocal standards at the Academy. Though the French is not always crisp enough, there’s a definite appreciation of Massenet’s delicate style, not least in the pit, where conductor Martin Andre presides benignly.Especially notable are Swedish soprano Louise Sjostedt in the title role, her strong, forward tone marred only by occasional unsteadiness and Julia Riley’s Prince Charming, her distinctive mezzo as clear as a bell. No less assured are Greek soprano Sophia Michailidou, whose coloratura as Cinderella’s fairy godmother sparkles and the striking baritone of Seung-Wook Seong as Cinderella’s father, which should take him a long way.Also adding to the fun are Ivana Dimitrijevic as the snobbish stepmother, as well as Laura Parfitt and Maria Kontra as her pushy daughters. With the help of these young artists, Massenet’s blend of pastiche, folk-inflected melody and sheer romance does the trick.

The singers move sure-footedly through the vocal lines with a requisite rhythmic verve, their vocal support rock-steady, a full bloom to the tone, always relishing the meaningful marriage of words and music.Replacing an ailing Mlada Khudolei, the lustrous Tatiana Borodina sang Fevronia as if born to the role, moulding the arching melodies as naturally as breathing, subtly projecting the young woman’s innocence and inner strength. Oleg Balashov brought vocal virility and tonal warmth to Prince Vsevolod.The veteran Gennady Bezzubenkov movingly delivered Prince Yuri’s elegiac paean to Kitezh (Act III). Most astonishing was Vassily Gorshkov’s staggering singing of the drunkard Grishka, which exactly caught the character’s truculence, fearful pragmatism and troubling conscience. A knockout!Valery Gergiev ensured orchestra and chorus covered themselves in glory. An unforgettable experience.

The Wedding represents the climax of Stravinsky’s Russian phase, with its vital presentation of age-old marriage rituals. This performance benefited from Russian soloists and chorus and had a more lyrical quality than most Western presentations. But it was no less powerful and memorably idiomatic.Oedipus, halfway between a concert work and a stage piece anyway, found a relaxed Narrator in Tim Piggott-Smith, seated throughout as if he was reading us a bedtime story from an armchair.But the decision to place the other soloists at the back of the stage was a mistake, robbing them of clarity and immediacy. Oleg Balashov’s Oedipus seemed underpowered and occasionally uncertain and neither Evgeny Nikitin’s Creon nor Fyodor Kuznetsov’s Tiresias really struck home. Only the lavishly voiced Jocasta – mezzo Zlata Bulycheva – really established herself as a strong personality.It is worth remembering that neither of these works, written during the composer’s long exile from his homeland, was made welcome there until recently, and at least as far as Oedipus went there was a tentative quality to this performance, with Gergiev scarcely looking up from his score. In fact, quite a few locally produced performances have packed more punch.

This harrowing slice of expressionism makes for uncomfortable, even disturbing viewing.The inventive staging by Richard Jones is as stark as it is uncompromising. The military setting is transposed to a modern baked bean canning factory, where harsh conditions, poor pay and assembly line rule the lives of the workers.The gritty portrayal of anti-hero Wozzeck by Christopher Purves is hauntingly impressive as he hallucinates and desperately tries to placate the paranoic characters that humiliate him. Yet Purves makes no easy appeal for sympathy as he strives to cope with a harsh foreman, a crazy doctor who experiments on him, an executive who seduces the mother of his child and then beats him up. His final descent into madness, culminating in murder, is conveyed with searing conviction, well matched by the passionate intensity of Gun-Brit Barkmin as the luckless mistress victim Marie. Fine performances too from Clive Bayley as the obsessed doctor, Peter Hoare as the sadistic foreman and Peter Svensson as the bully-boy stud.The picture-framed settings designed by Paul Steinberg for the 15 disjointed scenes played without interval, are separated by the lowering of a white screen, plain except for the product barcode. Continually intriguing, they contribute immeasurably to the dramatic effect.Vladimir Jurowski’s magisterial conducting of the demanding complex score is flawless. This co-production with Komische Oper of Berlin is sung in German, with surtitles essential to following the eccentric action, in both English and Welsh.

The orchestra (the Royal Philharmonic) is full-size, the chorus massive, and there is visual spectacle aplenty in the final act outside Seville’s bull ring. David Freeman’s production has plenty of life in the street scenes, and many noticeable vignettes. The intimate scenes, however, are harder to make successful in this vast space.Imelda Drumm nevertheless leads a strong, nominally second cast, with no weak vocal links. As Carmen, the Irish mezzo holds the attention with her feisty, punchy portrayal, putting over her numbers with real allure. She is nicely offset by soprano Julie Unwin’s Micaela, who presents Carmen’s naive rival positively and sings her main aria wonderfully.Making an even bigger splash is David Stephenson as the handsome macho bullfighter Escamillo. His rich and thrilling baritone should take him far. American-born tenor John Uhlenhopp also makes a strong impression vocally, even if dramatically his Don Jose is too passive – it is hard to see where the violence of the last act comes from. Of the smaller roles, Julian Tovey’s Zuniga registers with emphasis.The opera is sung in Amanda Holden’s excellent translation, a good deal of which comes over clearly. Peter Robinson conducts a generally clean and precise version of the score, although once or twice the ensemble goes awry. If this Carmen takes a while to get up to speed, once it does, it proves highly worthwhile.

And in the case of this eighth return of Miller’s 1987 Barber of Seville for ENO, directed by William Renton, there is no reason it shouldn’t.The commedia dell’arte influence runs deep – most obviously in Almaviva’s mistrels but also in the Bartolo-Rosina (Pantalone-Columbine) relationship and the clowning Figaro – and it is a production high on visual gags. With its current cast it is an irresistible night out.Company principal Mark Stone, a shining Don in ENO’s recent Don Giovanni, takes the role of Figaro, his faultless comic acting deflecting attention from his rounded, robust singing. Alison Roddy’s soprano makes for a cool but crystalline Rosina and Charles Workman’s Almaviva, though occasionally uncomfortable up top, manages to communicate an expressive, richly vowelled tone. But Andrew Shore’s return as Bartolo is nothing short of priceless, vocally assured yet spontaneous and a master of comic timing. His troublesome hernia may be a touch overdone but his command of the role, vocally and physically, is complete.The production still looks good, too, even if the scene change from the exterior to the interior of Bartolo’s apartment on this first night was rather clunky. In the pit Dominic Wheeler, after an underwhelming Overture, produces surprisingly supple phrasing and colouristic effect and commands a tight ensemble of singers and players.

This staging updates the action to contemporary times, with the desparately ill Violetta living the fast life as a Parisienne supermodel.It is a concept that did not orginally please some traditionalists, who found their much-loved herione dying in a hospital bed attached to a saline drip hard to take. The departure of the Russian musical director after a couple of performances did not inspire confidence either. That said, this staging is fresh and vivid, with a superb performance by Nuccia Focile, vivacious in the frenetic partying but so vulnerable and intensely moving. Jonathan Summers gives a warm-hearted and well-rounded portrayal of Germot, while Peter Wedd is at times rather restrained as Alfredo, not helped by being made the reserved outsider in the exuberant celebrity set.The settings by Christian Fenouillat are stylishly simple, the trendy furniture dominated by blood red drapes. The high fashion costumes by Agostino Cavalca are an eyecatching delight. The orchestra conducted by Carlo Rizzi and the chorus under Donald Nally are spot on.

One or two of the vocal performances, however, disappoint.German tenor Will Hartmann lacks the lyricism necessary for Tamino, and his voice sounds worn in places. The veteran German bass Jan-Hendrik Rootering sings Sarastro, though his lower register – crucial for this role – is weak these days and his voice generally less than it was. Finnish soprano Anna-Kristiina Kaappola proves an accurate but small-scale Queen of the Night, with no real menace.Some of the other principals, however, are prime. You woud have to go a long, long way to find a Papageno as expert and lovable as Simon Keenlyside: his performance is a classic of our time. Welsh soprano Rebecca Evans sings an impeccable Pamina, with not a note out of place.Also fitting perfectly into the bigger picture are Gail Pearson’s down-to-earth Papagena, and an excellent group of Three Boys (John Hewitt-Jones, David Stark and Zico Shaker). John Graham-Hall gives good value as Monostatos and Kyle Ketelsen’s Speaker is likeable without quite being authoritative in this important secondary role.But the achievement of conductor Charles Mackerras in the pit is a cause for celebration, as is his 80th birthday later this year.

Long may the production flourish.The second cast fields an imperious Turandot in Audrey Stottler, whose ample soprano not only effortlessly scales the heights but produces singing of rare sensitivity and refinement. She sings off words with a compelling urgency and characterises strongly, in the riddle scene subtly conveying Turandot’s shifting emotions. It’s a gripping impersonation.Yu Qiang Dai is the new Calaf. The voice has plenty of welly and he goes for the high notes with a will, though the tone can sound dry and raw. He is also at times rhythmically wilful. But he’s a fresh, fizzing stage presence, who imbues Calaf with a youthful and disarming ardour which in part mitigates his callous disregard of others’ sufferings.The other impressive newcomer is Cellia Costea, whose Liu is touchingly realised. She’s especially moving in her final moments (“Tanto amore segreto”). Her soprano is firm and full, with an Italianate warmth – she’d make a wonderful Mimi. Here surely is a future star.Mark Elder conducts an impeccably paced, red-hot reading, always mindful of the singers.

Like other of his recent productions, this one evolves amidst an encircling gloom. Designer Yannis Thavouris creates evocative settings by trucking monumental curved walls, one elaborately wood-carved, another painted with a foliage design, within which Paule Constable’s criss-crossing shafts of light pick out protagonists locked in emotionally charged encounters.However, too often darkness enshrouds them – such as Vitellia during the crucial recit that prefaces ‘Non piu di fiori’. Surely, after the revelation of Sesto’s attempt on Tito’s life, the action might lighten up.Clemenza is also about Tito’s statesmanship – visually he is associated with a sapling, with nurture. Yet McVicar relegates the chorus/citizenry to the orchestra pit, replacing them with stave-wielding, samurai-like Praetorians who seemingly resent his clemency. That may link the libretto to contemporary politics but contradicts its spirit and Mozart’s inspiriting music.McVicar draws powerful characterisations from the performers, a touch too much so from Emma Bell’s feral, shaven-headed Vitellia, hair-raisingly sung, who comes on like Messalina. Her change of heart confronted with Sesto’s fate thus becomes harder to take.However Sarah Connolly, singing with style and passion, fashions a subtly nuanced, moving portrayal of the anguished Sesto, long-haired to reflect gender and power reversal, while Paul Nilon, moulding the music with sympathetic command, brings gravitas and sensitivity to Tito.Sally Matthews and Stephanie Marshall imbue the young lowers Servilia and Annio with an attractive innocence. Roland Boer conducts a lithe yet urgent reading with the ENO orchestra on cracking form.

His vocalism is of an altogether superior class. He shapes every phrase with care and imagination, and the sheer artistry of his singing, together with a most attractive natural set of vocal colours, draws the ear again and again. Covent Garden should plan a new production for Calleja, who is too important an artist merely to slot into revivals, and in a nominal second cast at that.Anthony Michaels-Moore draws on his experience and solid voice for a Germont that is present and correct but dull. His anglicised Italian vowels are much in evidence. Both these principals, as well as Norah Amsellem’s vocally confident, dramatically uncharismatic Violetta would benefit from more incisive and detailed direction. Interaction between them is woefully limited.As on the first night, the smaller roles are good, though at Covent Garden one expects the best. Those registering most positively are Jeremy White’s Marquis d’Obigny, Robert Murray’s Gastone and Gillian Knight’s Annina. The rest are sketchily drawn.

Nor is the distraught Ninetta of the opera’s close quite right. Listen to the music, which implies deliverance, rejoicing, not the presage of further trials. Director Martin Duncan rather lays on the ‘message’.Musically, David Parry’s crude, insensitive, breakneck conducting, which careers at headlong speeds as if he’s a train to catch, almost torpedoes the revival. Orchestra and singers scramble to keep up. The latter especially receive no support when it comes to articulating clean runs. Parry shows zilch understanding of Rossinian style.However, despite the dread Parry factor, Mary Hegarty successfully repeats her plucky Ninetta, whose dignity and courage steadfastly resist Robert Poulton’s chillingly lubricious Mayor. Jonathan Best again impresses as Ninetta’s father, while Ashley Catling’s youthful Gianetta effortlessly tosses off  the ‘fioriture’ against the odds.

Its straightforward narrative approach and traditional designs allow a variety of singers to step into the major roles without having to worry too much about complex business, let alone a ‘concept’. The downside is that it can be a dull experience if the central performances lack strong personality.As the doomed courtesan, French soprano Norah Amsellem looks a dream and she proves a fluent vocalist, if a touch careless at times. But she fails to stamp her mark upon the role and does not engage the audience with her emotional plight. Only with ‘Addio del passato’ in the final act does she really strike home.As her young lover, American tenor Charles Castronovo fields an equally adept vocal performance, though one without any individual features whatsoever. He looks and sounds charming but you never believe in him as the ardent, hot-headed provincial youth bowled over by his glamorous partner.With Gerald Finley’s Germont, however, the performance finally comes alive. Though his voice is on the small side for the role, and not exactly Italianate, Finley’s musical scrupulousness, dramatic flair and sheer intelligence win the day. He misses nothing.Small roles and chorus scenes are well done and conductor Maurizio Benini is never less than efficient and sometimes more. But there is a gap in the centre of the piece that cannot be disguised.

It also features two strong narrators in tenor Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts and baritone Toby Stafford-Allen.Clement Ishmael’s Gra?yna: The Triumph of the Queen is based on a Polish folk tale in which Queen Gra?yna, having foreseen her husband’s death in battle, administers a sleeping potion and takes his place. Omar Ebrahim makes a powerful king and Jacqueline Miura a resilient wife. There is some striking unison writing for the chorus of courtiers and messengers, and some initially appealing but ultimately overdone doubling of trumpet with the king’s vocal lines. Last comes Errollyn Wallen’s Another America – Earth. Wallen’s handling of the score may be the most ambitious but there is far too much going on musically and dramatically, leading to an incoherent dramatic thread and long stretches of loud music and high vocal writing.Preceding the operas are six arias, well sung by Mary Plazas and a sophisticated-sounding Rodney Clarke. These are in general successful, if not ambitious – among them Nicky Clarke’s Son of the Morning and Alex Wilson’s Rendezvous, both jazzy numbers, though one greets the morning and the other faces death. The other offerings include Space by percussionist Orphy Robinson – more of a scena but far too wordy – and Dainty Drysdale’s disturbing The Journey, the song of a little girl who wakes up to find herself being taken by her father to the seaside, to dump the body of her murdered mother.

1411,A Child of Our Time review at Coliseum London,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2005/a-child-of-our-time-review-at-coliseum-london/,A Child of Our Time,Coliseum London,A Child of Our Time review at Coliseum London,,2005-02-02,David Blewitt,"Michael Tippett’s oratorio to his own text, written in protest at conditions which make persecution possible, is based upon a real incident in which a 17-year-old Jewish refugee, driven to despair by the Nazi persecution of his race, shot dead a German diplomat.The richly scored, tripartite work deploys a range of forms – the English choral tradition, jazz and popular dance. Negro Spirituals fulfil the role of Lutheran chorales. Instrumental textures are rich, the choral lines closely woven to lend weight to words.Paul Brown’s spare design makes much use of allusive props lowered and raised – types of blade, bulbs, stones, small squares of turf. An insidious pall of smoke hovers over everything, Mark Henderson’s lighting piercing it with shafts which intensify the encircling gloom.Slow walking dominates movement, except for outbursts like the chorus “Away with them! Curse them! Kill them!” Everyone tends to stare mesmerised into the middle distance. Images of Christian faith and tyranny prevail – the Pieta, the cross, stone cairns for the dead, mass graves, instruments of torture.The exemplary quartet of soloists bring gravitas to the staging, though Sara Fulgoni, like the chorus, fails to projects words, even though Martyn Brabbins’ impassioned conducting is properly supportive.The overall effect is of an act of piety so decorous as to negate the oratorio’s horrific concerns, as if to spare the audience the experience of real pain. The unspeakable violence in Rwanda, Afghanistan and the ongoing tragedy of Iraq render unacceptable such artistic placebos.

And in an art form grown blase on outrageousness, it is refreshing to see a production in which it is the opera itself and not its interpretation which provides the shocks. Here, and this is just for starters, are gay and interracial relationships, incest, rape, bare breasts, heaving bosoms and horse-whipped bottoms – and they are all part of the plot.Indeed, McDonald somewhat tempers the outrage in his interpretation. Honing the story, which strongly references Shakespeare’s Tempest, down to the psychological experimentation of Peter Savidge’s analyst, Mangus, as he plays puppeteer with stuffy couple Thea and Faber, and their sexually precocious ward Flora.Musically, it displays a gloriously jubilant gallimaufry of influences, which conductor Richard Armstrong uses to bring out a surprisingly coherent and rounded set of performances from both orchestra and soloists.Jane Irwin and Rachel Haynes are forceful as Thea and her sister Denise. And if Derrick Parker’s voice is somewhat gentle as bisexual writer, Mel, in comparison to Hilton Marlton’s as his musician lover Dov, it is perfect for the blues-influenced passages. But if they provide the eye candy with their cross-dressing antics, it is Rachel Nicholls’ Flora and Andrew Shore’s Faber who are the real food for both ear and mind.

Swansea City Opera, now in its second year, is taking this production to mid-scale venues far and wide. Some are in areas where access to opera is limited.The company makes exceeding merry with Rossini’s tale of pre-marital scheming. A mood of mischief prevails. There are many pleasant comic touches – the iron gate to Bartolo’s house is invisible but we can hear it being unlocked and swung open. The translation, from Bridgett Gill and Brendan Wheatley, has much wit of the modern kind.Aris Nadiran looks and sounds as the barber Figaro should. He has the musical range and the stamina. Kate Woolveridge and Paul Hopwood make a fine pair of lovers. Woolveridge has enchanting tones and Hopwood has exquisite phrasing. Mark Ashmore’s playing of the music master will have audiences chortling, especially with his prolonged Buona Sera exit.Each character has an elegant costume. Soldiers and the onstage musicians are dressed splendidly. The main characters have a stock of comic gestures but when all of the cast are on stage the production can look static. Sets are simple but eminently practical. Walls and towers are painted cream with thin line details and they are angled for perspective.The Swansea City Opera Orchestra gives good and consistent support to a reading that will give lots of pleasure.

It is colourfully designed by Isabelle Partiot-Pieri (sets) and Katia Duflot (costumes) and astutely staged by the talented French director Charles Roubaud, who supplies what is easily the most lively and crisply performed of the three shows the Kirov has brought to London this time around. The Royal Opera should grab him.The cast is strong. Irina Gordei is a tireless Turandot, grandly imperious and vocally trenchant. She is extremely well partnered by the Calaf of the baritonal tenor Vladimir Galuzin, whose honed, powerful voice is combined with a stern stage presence.Irma Gigolashvili’s Liu is hardly less good, though she is not quite so secure vocally. But she is a fluent actress and is moving as the loving but doomed slave girl.There is a solid Timur from Gennady Bezzubenko and a notable trio of Mandarins in the shapes of Andrei Spekhov, Alexander Timchenko and Oleg Balashov.On this occasion the chorus is formidable and the orchestra, playing with a magnificent depth of tone, is on its strongest form. The Kirov’s charismatic artistic director and chief conductor Valery Gergiev shows a fine appreciation of the work’s structure and colouristic range and even manages the feat of making the Alfano ending sound on a par with the rest.In all a very classy evening and one that effaces bad memories of the Kirov’s disappointing Verdi season at Covent Garden in 2001.

However, her insightful production ideas are not always fully integrated. Here she updates to thirties Spain, which may be cost effective but provokes few novel thoughts about the opera.The tragedy unfolds over a single night. During the overture the Dons Giovanni and Ottavio part en route to carnivalesque celebrations, the former climbs to tackle Donna Anna and kick starts the action. Giovanni casts a pall of licentious violence over his world, which only lifts at his death to let in light, a blinding ‘coup de theatre’.Fuchs fortunately concentrates on character. The lively cast achieve an enviable ensemble led from the front by Roderick Williams’ dangerously seductive, violent Giovanni, as compulsive in his womanising as he is in flouting convention, his burnished baritone fully in command of the music – his ‘Deh vieni alla finestra’ is bewitching.Iain Paton is the sweet-toned, dark horse of an Ottavio, Andrew Foster-Williams the unusually sympathetic Leporello – is he a military deserter? Giselle Allen’s Elvira is slave to Giovanni, Susannah Glanville’s Anna sexually equivocal about him, Kim-Marie Woodhouse’s Zerlina predictably naïve. Vocally, the ladies are less secure.Niki Turner provides a simple design of ladders leading to a lateral, raised walkway backed by black drapes. Bruno Poet’s darkly brooding lighting defines locales, shafts of light pitilessly revealing vicious and seedy goings-on. Richard Farnes conducts a driven reading which intensifies the onstage action, the orchestra on cracking form in a production worth catching.

1416,Babette’s Feast review at Linbury Studio Royal Opera House London,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2004/babette-s-feast-review-at-linbury-studio-royal-opera-house-london/,Babette’s Feast,Linbury Studio Royal Opera House London,Babette’s Feast review at Linbury Studio Royal Opera House London,,2004-12-30,Edward Bhesania,"Gabriel Axel’s 1987 film on Karen Blixen’s Babette’s Feast makes a centrepiece of the eponymous chef’s extravagant meal but in John Browne’s operatic adaptation for children and adults, the meal only arrives during the opera’s last 15 minutes. The wary townspeople eat their fill from empty plates, and though prudent from a practical view, it is a bit like serving the hot dog without the sausage.Otherwise, Tim Supple’s production has bold touches, highlighting Babette’s involvement in French revolutionary violence and, of course, reflecting on the nature of fundamentalism, in this case Christian. I am not sure, though, that all parents of the opera’s target audience of 9-year-olds and above would feel happy about the Parisian singer Papin coming on to the Dean’s daughter, Philippa, in her singing lesson, or the rowdy drinking game realistically played by the soldiers.For me, the love and craft that Babette lavishes on her culinary art – central to the charm of the story – is underplayed but the simple, wood-planked backdrop and the in-the-round setting do create a sense of intimacy, matched by Browne’s claustrophobic opening music, reflecting the severe traditions of the remote Norwegian community.The cast is highly impressive all round, with Riccardo Simonetti doubling as a comically nervous Suitor and a communicative Narrator and Paul Reeves acting beyond his years as the inflexible Dean. There is not a single weak link – even the two Boys made an impression. Olivier Dumait’s vocally lithe soldier and particularly Allison Cook’s powerfully rich Babette stand out, along with the two young soprano sisters, Yvette Bonner as Philippa and Claire Wild’s Martine. This feast is extremely well sung but I am not convinced it is as successful as, say, Rachel Portman’s recent opera on The Little Prince in appealing to both children and adults.

As so often with Keith Warner’s work, the profusion of ideas fail to gel.Stefanos Lazaridis’ settings, evocatively lit by Wolfgang Gobbel, are allusive but imprecise. The Rhine is cluttered – a curved boat chute, cupboards, a huge Christmas tree bauble housing the gold. The gods inhabit a space lab in the sky, Alberich a Frankenstein-style lab with Mime as his Igor.There’s no sense of a universe within which elemental hierarchies, as exemplified by the protagonists, struggle for ascendancy. Instead, the effect is claustrophobic, of a confined, dysfunctional family at loggerheads.For all that, Warner conjures memorable images – Loge using one of Freia’s apples to control Wotan in the Nibelheim episode, Alberich’s capture, Wotan ferociously wresting the ring from him and Loge’s shifty attempts to purloin the Tarnhelm.The singing and acting are, for the most part, impressive, though the cast seem still to be easing into their roles, Philip Langridge’s arresting, Max Wall-like Loge excepted. He makes every word tell to fashion a witty and subtle portrait of the eternal, if unreliable, fixer.However, Bryn Terfel’s Wotan, oafish at first, soon develops into a gripping study of aggressive ambition. It is a pity he occasionally pushes the voice expressively into ugliness. Franz-Josef Selig and Phillip Ens are well-contrasted giants, Jane Henschel a Sybilline Erda and Will Hartmann a gadfly Froh.Antonio Pappano’s conducting tends to highlight moments at the expense of the overall architecture, while textures are sometimes muddy or ill-judged. Wagner is not yet in the blood. Overall, though, an intriguing start.

Two evocative ballets depict a New York of faceless commuters and the routine of blue collar bliss. William Tuckett choreographs them with flair and precision.Antony McDonald’s settings and Emma Ryott’s costumes resonate with period atmosphere – Norman Rockwell, Tin-Tin, Georgia O’Keefe, MGM musicals and polka dots. Tim Albery’s direction projects the narrative cleanly with verve and style.A superb cast sing and act it to the hilt, though they don’t all project words cleanly – my one gripe. Invidiously, I note Karen Coker’s svelte, laid back Venus and Loren Geeting’s sympathetic Rodney. As Savory and his secretary Molly, Ron Li-Paz and Christianne Tisdale swap insults with brio.Eric Roberts is a show-stealing psychiatrist, Jessica Walker a ball breaking Gloria Kramer, Rodney’s fiancee. James Holmes’ idiomatic conducting explodes with Broadway pizzazz yet is sensitive at more tender moments. The orchestra revel in it. Fight for tickets.

And indeed Michael Yeargan’s handsome Pollock theatre with VR-embossed curtain and footlights evocatively exploits Victoriana. However this Lyric Opera (Chicago) production is all icing and no cake, decorous not dashing, transatlantic tat with no bite to the satire.Elijah Moshinsky’s sedate direction rarely allows performers to play to the line so dialogue drags. Characters move without urgency or purpose. The constabulary shamble around and the choreographer recycles a clutch of tired, routine steps.Characterisation is misguided and minimal. Frederic and Ruth point lines too knowingly to convey innocence and naivety. The swivel-hipped Pirate King resembles Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean but languishes when he should roister.However, imbued with a bit more zip, the show might at least entertain. Unfortunately nothing and nobody survives Mark Shanahan’s conducting, whose baton beats out every bar with a relentless earnestness. Tempos are so uniformly slow that the singers are mostly unable to sustain the natural contours of the vocal lines.Sullivan’s lilting, well-sprung melodies sometimes barely limp along. Mabel’s Stay, Frederick, Stay briefly springs to life, but her subsequent Ah, Leave Me Not to Pine plummets from its andante into a broken-backed adagio, then runs out of puff.Still, Mark Wilde’s Frederick sports a pleasing tenor, Jean Rigby and Richard Suart enliven Ruth and the Major General, while Julianne De Villiers as Edith is a real find. All four project words. Overall, a bummer.

The stone tablets labelling the temples to Wisdom, Reason and Charity in the first-act finale are poorly defined and also insufficiently lit. Some of the dialogue is unconvincingly delivered and some of the acting, especially from Michael McBride’s Tamino and Jane Harrington’s Pamina, unintentionally hammy. The Queen of the Night, sung by Laura Parfitt, though vocally agile – despite a slip in the Allegro of her first aria – is dramatically unprepossessing. Her three Ladies are stilted in their would-be comic tussles over who is to nurse the unconscious Tamino.Whether these faults are due to a lack of rehearsal time or poor direction, the production nevertheless has redeeming qualities. Chief among them is Davis’ ability to draw gravity and lovingly shaped detail from the Royal Academy Sinfonia. There is impressive singing from Jane Harrington’s Pamina, rich-toned but clean and powerful, and Ukrainian Viktor Rud’s Papageno, with some winning comic acting and topical reference to government-swapping in the Ukraine.The three Boys, taken here by three female students, are serendipitously well-matched for height as well as voice and Charne Rochford makes a strong impression as First Priest. Robert Anderson’s Sarastro was also striking in his matching of warm resonance with authoritative, understated stage presence.

In these roles, Thomas Walker and Nicola Stonehouse do so with involving emotional attachment. Both are confident and engaging singers, attending to textual clarity, dramatic tension and tonal quality in equally high measure. A good start.The scene at the camp reveals a strong Collatinus, Tarquinius, Junius trio and in the second scene the women’s idyllic routine of spinning and linen-folding is delicately depicted. Tarquinius arrives to shatter this and from the beginning we have been sure of his single-mindedness.Jacques Imbrailo sings the role with surging power, matched by an impressively honed physique, making this Tarquinius aggressive and terrifying. For her part, Anna Grevelius in the title role shows a vocal flexibility that ranges from light, sweet lyricism, to pained hysteria.The 13-piece RCM Opera Orchestra plays with soloistic definition but chamber-like cohesion under Michael Rosewell, who expertly choreographs a coiling tension that initially erupts, post-rape, in the fervent chorale interlude for the choruses.There is the bare minimum of props, though an artfully arranged library of books in the background suggests, as do the chorus roles, a dialogue with the past, highlighting the immediacy of an age-old myth.In sum, everything about this performance aligns with a sense of passion and purpose that makes it a powerful operatic experience.

It says much for the relatively inexperienced Van Kooten’s calibre, both personal and professional, that she pulled the evening off. Anyone expecting to hear Gheorghiu would not have been disappointed by her replacement.Slender and clearly one of the youngest courtesans in the business, she tackled the demanding opening aria with confidence and savoir faire, winning a warm round of applause. Thereafter she continued to impress with her lyric vocal quality and ease on stage. Only the more dramatic third act showed her limitations – it’s more a Mozart-sized voice right now.

The plot has its origins in the popular Italian theatre of commedia dell’arte – the elderly Don Pasquale decides to punish his nephew Ernesto by marrying a young woman himself, thereby disinheriting him. He is fooled, of course, by his ‘best friend’ Dr Malatesta, and learns his lesson by the happy end.It is a top-notch cast. Simone Alaimo is an experienced Pasquale, able to convey the character’s blend of ridiculousness and pathos without descending into buffoonery. He is wonderfully partnered in a comic double act by Buston Keaton-faced baritone Alessandro Corbelli, whose Malatesta has every buffo skill at his command.Nor will you ever hear the role of young Ernesto sung and acted with more charm and elegance than it is here by Juan Diego Florez, today’s leading tenore di grazia. Newcomer Moldovan soprano Tatiana Lisnic is a precise and determined Norina – Ernesto’s girlfriend and Pasquale’s false bride – but she needs a little more warmth to prevent the character becoming unsympathetic.Conductor Bruno Campanella also needs to deliver the score with more bite and sparkle, but any deficiencies in the pit are more than made up by Miller’s unfailingly clever and inventive staging. Vocally and visually, this is a delightful evening.

The opera tells the story of delectable young Semele, loved by the god Jupiter and therefore hated by his jealous wife Juno, who comes up with a terrible revenge for the not overly bright blonde bombshell. She is played by Carolyn Sampson, as lovely to look at as she is to hear, which is saying something. As Juno, Patricia Bardon has a whale of a time impersonating the Queen in a production that transfers the sex and politics theme from the world of Greek myth to the present day – and indeed Buckingham Palace. Like Sampson she voices Handel’s notes with flamboyant distinction.Anne Marie Gibbons is excellent as Semele’s sister Ino and Robin Blaze sings mellifluously as Semele’s unwanted suitor Athamas. Janis Kelly is a hoot as Juno’s accident prone PA Iris and Iain Paterson comes up with vocal and dramatic gravitas as Semele’s father Cadmus.Of the principals, only Ian Bostridge’s Jupiter disappoints. He pipes the notes accurately but is dull as the pleasure-loving king of the gods.However, Laurence Cummings’ sparky conducting makes Handel’s score dance and the chorus and orchestra follow his lead.

James Farncombe’s discreet, emotive lighting unemphatically enhanced the fairytale morality.Guildhall rightly opted for the opera comique version, with a revised act three, catching the humour, hurly-burly and pathos of the piece, while Clive Timms conducted a rhythmically lively, clean textured reading full of Gallic wit.Medcalf forged a fine ensemble out of the talented cast with the acting of the highest order and the singing mostly so. Anna Stephany movingly caught Mignon’s naivety and goodness without being glutinous and sang with a full, firm tone – she brought a rapt intensity to “Connais tu le pays?”Susanna Andersson tossed off Philine’s music, full of decorative flicks, with an assured agility, coquettish without being brazen. John Llewlyn Evans’ Lothario, Mignon’s temporarily loopy father, grew in stature vocally and Benjamin Segal, the likeable Laerte, fielded a warm, light baritone with style.

But then matters are not helped here, either, by having the young divas prominently miked with those ‘wrap around the chin’ jobs that inhibit the sound, too, rather than allowing them to fully inhabit it. So though they make nice sounds, it comes filtered through a sound system that can’t cope with them.Mind you, though the quality of the singing itself is not in doubt, precisely what they are sometimes singing leaves something to be desired. Howling “I am a diva,/My bosoms are so huge”, while dressed in a Viking costume is hardly the stuff of operatic nuance or subtlety.It is indicative of the strenuously undergraduate vein of humour that permeates the show throughout. A panoply of props that had them donning jester’s hats and glasses that contain eyeballs on springs, not to mention brandishing boxing gloves, were also an unnecessary distraction. And I am still wondering whether or not I actually dreamt an exit one of them did on a skateboard.The attempts at verbal humour in several sketches between songs also fell dismally flat, at least in the sophisticated confines of this venue.

Designer Richard Hudson and director Phyllida Lloyd have dropped Wagner’s legendary settings for a modern vernacular. Mime’s forest cave becomes a down-at-heel flat, with his and Siegfried’s bunk beds a yard away from the kitchen sink. The Wanderer consults Erda about the future of the world not in a mountain landscape but in a retirement home, where she sits slumped in front of a TV set.The problem is not that it isn’t traditional – Tim Albery’s outstanding Scottish Opera staging was anything but conventional – but that it replaces something very big with something very small. The wealth of ideas in Wagner’s drama is scarcely suggested. Worse, some of the lengthy dialogues are just plain dull.Richard Berkeley-Steele nevertheless impresses with his commitment in the title role. Even if his voice lacks power, his rowdy teenager is near ideal physically. Kathleen Broderick’s Brunnhilde just about gets through her last-scene vocal ordeal, though it is touch and go. Robert Hayward’s Wotan, disguised as the Wanderer, fields plenty of tone but we have no more idea who this character is than when this Ring began.Even John Graham-Hall’s Mime fails to seize the comic-grotesque potential of a wonderful role. But Andrew Shore’s Alberich and Patricia Bardon’s Erda remind us what ENO’s standards should be.As does the superb orchestra, though Paul Daniel conducts a shapeless account of the score.

Cammarano’s libretto has its ultimate source in Dante. Pia, the wife of Nello, has her honour besmirched by Ghino, Nello’s cousin. The discovery of a man who flees – in fact it is her brother – from her private apartments provokes Nello into throwing his wife into a dank and dismal prison. Ghino’s subsequent guilt and Nello’s belated reconciliation with Pia – who has meanwhile been poisoned on his orders – scarcely redeem unsympathetic characters. Nor is the score anywhere near as memorable as Lucia or Maria Stuarda.That said, the principals throw themselves into the Donizettian fray with aplomb. Bruce Ford rounds out his in-depth portrayal of neurotic villain Ghino with keen declamation and Roberto Servile as heavy husband Nello is purposeful and incisive. In playing Pia’s brother Rodrigo, Manuela Custer takes full advantage of the opportunities of a highlight prison scene.But the focus is the heroine, whose wide-ranging music draws singing of spellbinding power and expressivity from Majella Cullagh. She crowns the evening with a scintillating account of an alternative finale Donizetti wrote to give the work a happy ending – and duly brings the house down.David Parry’s conducting is immaculate and the LPO proves yet again what a marvellous orchestra it is for opera.

As the animals of the grove emerge to listen to Tamino’s eponymous flute, the panto spirit takes off for real. This is not a Flute that plumbs the depths of masonic ritual or enlightenment through trial or the passage of darkness and light. But it does boast the luminous colourful sets of Anthony Ward, brilliantly lit by Jean Kalman. For the most part these are abstract, almost fluorescent, backdrops but they come into their own to highlight the sunny radiance of Sarastro’s palace. Similarly, the rippling sheets of red and blue satin effectively represent Tamino and Pamina’s passage through fire and then water.Rich colours run through the costumes, too, not least the cobalt-blue strapless dresses of the Queen of the Night and her three attendants. All very visual but not especially visionary. Conductor Alexander Briger contains rather than expounds the wonder and excitement in the score, though he brings an impressively light touch to Monostatos’ ‘Alles fühlt der Liebe Freuden’. Toby Stafford-Allen makes an ideal Papageno, highlighting his difference in nature to Tamino without overplaying the fool. Peter Wedd, singing Tamino, has an attractive lyrical quality, though his top end occasionally sounds weary. Valerie Condoluci is a suitably vicious and vocally powerful Queen of the Night and Swedish soprano Henriikka Grondahl steals the show with a Pamina of great vocal and emotional sophistication.

The gilt-walled fin-de-siecle drawing room returns, as does the touch of comedy as Melisande appears at the beginning of act three out of a suspended light fitting, Rapunzel-like, to let down her hair.While Marie Arnet’s Melisande in Glyndebourne’s summer production was a lost innocent, Tove Dahlberg’s is more remote – an inert being almost bereft of self, who is only a reflection of the men around her. Dahlberg combines a mysterious persona with engagingly pure, bright singing and beautifully sculpted French vowels. She gets right to the core of the notes, even though Debussy’s recitative-style writing can be unyielding. Andrew Slater’s Golaud doesn’t altogether match Dahlberg’s vocal presence – his French is significantly weaker too – and appears too nice by far when confronting her over her lost wedding ring – destroying the tension of their act two scene. As Pelleas, Kevin Greeenlaw is ardent and enthusiastic but sings with a Bostridge-like veiled tone, while Christian Treguier’s edgy sounding Arkel doesn’t befit the character’s sage, kingly status. In Pascal Rophe’s hands the score is vibrantly alive throughout, though he could sometimes draw more sophistication from his players. The shadows of darkness and ambiguity, for me, never fall palpably enough in this production, which is lucky to have the talents of Tove Dahlberg to lift it.

And almost a hundred years after it was written the boast remains true, thanks to a production which twists languorously into the tale’s psychological depths.Michele Kalmandi’s Bluebeard is commanding and forceful. His voice rises over the orchestra as he warns his new wife against entering the seven locked doors of his castle. By contrast, Andrea Szanto’s Judith has to fight against the orchestra to become heard – until she gets her way, that is. As a reflection of the power balance it is a trick which is slightly overplayed but, as in everything here, it emphasises the unsettling sense of the piece.Nicky Rieti’s set deals superbly with the problems of depicting the different rooms – from torture chamber to lake of tears – until the  last, containing Bluebeard’s previous wives, turns out simply to be the hall from which the others lead off. A truly new twist.Sadly, Erwartung does not live up to this haunting, provoking and exciting start. In an Edward Hopper-like motel room, the Woman finds her dead lover behind the bed. There is no expectation, only laughter. Renate Behle, it must be said, is fantastic in the role. Her leaping, hurdling, voice matches to every dissonant note. Under the baton of Richard Armstrong, the orchestra of Scottish Opera acquit themselves without blemish. But the whole falls well short.

Robert Innes Hopkins’s designs evoke the period skilfully and his costumes offer a clever blend of the chic and the makeshift.But Slater’s decision to add an extra layer to the plot by making this a filming of Manon compromises the clarity of an essentially simple if ambiguous moral tale. It is not obvious where the filming begins and ends and the director himself seems to lose interest in the idea before the evening’s over.Few operas rely so absolutely on just two principal, and this is not an ideal pairing. In the title role Natalia Dercho does some stylish things but both vocally and physically she is too mature to suggest an 18-year-old gold-digger let loose in sophisticated Paris. As her young lover Des Grieux, Hugh Smith has a sizeable voice but not one with much Italianate quality to it. He is a limited actor.It is left to Christopher Purves as Manon’s cynical brother and Brian Bannatyne-Scott as her elderly admirer Geronte to steal the show, which they duly do.But this is a great night for Opera North’s orchestra and for incoming music director Richard Farnes, whose attention to every last semiquaver of Puccini’s writing pays the richest of dividends.

Instead he digs deep to reveal the emotional confusion and pain underlying the opera buffa, creating a school for lovers where hard, distressing yet salutary lessons are learnt. As spectators we laugh guiltily.Designer Tobias Hoheisel’s huge daguerreotype camera opens to reveal a period interior. David Finn bathes it in a silvery light, which acquires a sunshine warmth as affections wax and wane. Costumes are period, the young officers fetchingly disguised in Middle Eastern gear.Peter Savidge’s slightly eccentric, strongly sung Don Alfonso owns the camera, so that the evolving comedy becomes refracted through the lens of his experience and takes on the patina of early prints, pin-pointing the lovers’ shifting patterns of behaviour and their self-deceptions. Claire Wild’s silver-toned, worldly-wise Despina is his unwitting accomplice in the enterprise.There is a splendid quartet of lovers. Malin Bystrom is a mettlesome Fiordiligi, Ann Taylor a Dorabella who, unusually, is almost as strong-willed as her sister. Both sing off words with full tone and firm attack – Bystrom delivering her set-pieces with burning conviction, Taylor imbuing ‘Smanie implacabili’ with a sly sense of the ridiculous.Iain Paton deploys his mellifluous and full-bodied tenor and refined acting to create a larky yet serious Ferrando. Witness his subtly inflected singing of ‘Un’aura amorosa’. Meanwhile, Roderick Williams cannily catches Guglielmo’s volatile, slightly narcissistic temperament, his richly resonant baritone giving infinite pleasure.Yves Abel conducts a richly nuanced reading, rhythmically alert, with warm, transparent textures. The orchestra plays like angels.

In ancient Rome, Emilia, priestess in Vesta’s temple, finds herself crowning her former lover Decio with the victor’s laurel. When he later seeks her out in the temple the sacred flame goes out, for which her punishment is to be buried alive. After sentence is carried out, Decio stabs himself.It is a high-flown classical drama, for which Mercadante provides suitably grand and imposing music, including several masterly ensembles. The best of the score reveals a composer deserving renewed attention.Thomas de Mallet Burgess’ production is saddled with some peculiar hand gestures by numbers for the chorus – school of Peter Sellars – and Jamie Vartan’s designs evoke no particular period with any certainty.But Paolo Arrivabeni’s conducting energises the noble if sombre piece, with some remarkable contributions from the male principals, especially Dante Alcala’s sterling singing as Decio. He is certainly a tenor to watch.Strong contributions too from Davide Damiani as Decio’s friend Publio and Andrea Patucelli as the High Priest. The women are less convincing vocally but this nevertheless proves a highly worthwhile revival of an impressive score.

Wexford here revives the first of his operas, based on one of the famous tales of Hoffmann.The scene is Rome at Carnival time, where Prince Bastianello and his servant Pantalone set up a complex intrigue to put the relationship of the actor Claudio and the seamstress Giazinta on a more secure basis. Changes of identity are involved, with Claudio being made to believe that he is Cornelio, Prince of Assyria, in love with Princess Brambilla – Giazinta, of course, in disguise. Amidst the merry escapades darker themes of identity are explored.Braunfels’s 1908 score is heard in its 1931 revision. The composer reveals comprehensive musical skills but his skittery scherzo writing rarely settles down into anything lyrical. A more precise performance might leave a stronger impression.But Daniele Belardinelli’s conducting has plenty of dash and Rosetta Cucchi’s production, to clever and witty designs by Maria Rosaria Tartaglia, is bright and breezy.There are mixed vocal standards, with Elena Lo Forte’s Giazinta the weakest link, but appealing portrayals from Peter Paul as Bastianello and Enrico Marabelli as Pantalone. Stronger still are the fluent Claudio of high tenor Eric Shaw as Claudio and the characterful Barbara – Giazinta’s old friend – of Ekaterina Gubanova.

It is an exploration of the ongoing cycles of birth, love and death, shared by the animal and human kingdoms. The doubling roles, in which singers are cast as both animals and humans, emphasise further the common preoccupations.James Conway’s touring production, revived here by Felix Barrett, adds its own conceit, setting up the opera to play within an opera. The human-inhabited back-story pre-empts the marriage of the poacher Harasta to Terynka, a character unseen in the opera. The celebrations occasion the enactment of the vixen’s story in the opera proper. While Conway intriguingly twists the helix again – favouring especially the animal nature of humans, rather than vice versa – there is too little time in the opera’s prelude to set this up convincingly.Despite the very simple lighting and starkly monochrome backdrop, there is plenty of colour on stage with Louise Walsh as a wily but enchanting vixen, Richard Burkhard fantastic as the dog, though vocally lightweight as the poacher and Roderick Earle the powerful Forester. Peter Robinson ably conducts Jonathan Dove’s highly effective reduced instrumentation of Janacek’s score. Conway’s drama, framed by chairs, typewriters, suitcases and other human accoutrements, may get in the way but it at least raises the question not only of how humans treat animals but of how we treat each other.

The best sections resonate with Czech colour but elsewhere a sub-Wagnerian pall hangs over proceedings. The story nevertheless has resonance.Eva is betrothed to Manek, whose mother Mesjanovka considers her beneath the family, so she goes off with the lowly furrier Samko out of a mixture of despair and spite. But he proves a weak husband and Eva blames his indifference for the death of their young daughter. She returns to Manek as a kept woman but Mesjanovka once again intervenes and Eva ends her sequence of failed relationships in the waters of the Danube.Unfortunately Foerster struggles to maintain musical interest. In addition, Paul Curran’s patchy production makes errors of judgement – adding in a vision of the dead child and sending up Manek’s horrendous mother – that weaken the drama’s impact. Nor does Jaroslav Kyzlink’s indifferent conducting help.Denisa Hamarova needs more dramatic weight as Mesjanovka – designer Paul Edward’s parodistic costume does not help – and Iveta Jirikova is unsympathetic as Eva. The men do better – Kostyantyn Andreyev attacks Manek with dynamism and Igor Tarasov is genuinely likeable as Samko – but it is not enough to redeem an uneven piece of work.

Laura Hopkins’ simple, picture-book period settings still look good. Peter Mumford’s lighting – revived by Jenny Cane – is evocative without being obtrusive. Revival director Ian Rutherford ensures Matthew Warchus’ original vision remains unimpaired.Mark Wigglesworth, conducting his first Falstaff, shapes a reading of power and sensitivity, the pacing impeccable, which subtly reveals the score’s architecture as the comedy gathers momentum. The orchestra plays celestially for him, which cannot be said of recent performances under other batons.The revival also generates crisp, infectious ensemble work. The cast distils the comedy without resort to mugging and funny walks, plays to each other with a shared pleasure in the act of creation and finds the underlying wisdom and seriousness which pervade Verdi’s last great masterpiece. Such perfection is all too rare at the Coliseum these days.The singing throughout is warm, centred and subtly nuanced – Wigglesworth is most considerate of his singers and 90% of words ping crystal-clear into the auditorium.Stepping into the fat knight’s role at the 11th hour, Andrew Shore is the paragon of these virtues, his portrayal as touching as it is roguish. His delivery of the ‘Evil world’ monologue is heart-rending in its self-knowledge. Susannah Glanville and Jean Rigby are the tonally lustrous objects of his desire, Mistresses Alice and Meg.Gillian Keith and Colin Lee make Nanetta and Fenton a sparky pair of lovers. Ashley Holland is the gullible, full-voiced Ford. Indeed, there is not a weak link. A life-enhancing evening.

His attempt to replicate reality renders it spurious.Gypsy women pose and flounce like fashion models during the tavern scene, designer beggars crowd Melitone for food, while Don Carlo-as-student rustles up a visual aid to illustrate his fake Vargas story, as if briefing a board meeting. Slowly advancing soldiery, puny pink puffs issuing from their muskets, represent the Velletri battle, the victory celebrated with cutesy ballet dancing.Nor are there compensatory musical pleasures. Antonio Pappano stepped in valiantly, upon Riccardo Muti’s petulant withdrawal, to conduct his first Forza, so it is perhaps unfair to judge him too harshly. However, his reading is fast, loud and crude-textured, the singers hustled through crucial sections and denied any freedom to be expressive.As a result the majority bellow out the vocal lines at full throttle, with little attempt at legato. Ferrucio Furlanetto’s Padre Guardiano and Ambrogio Maestri’s Don Carlo are the worst offenders. Salvatore Licitra occasionally shows sensitivity but his Alvaro mainly comes across as a self-regarding, provincial Italian tenor.Violeta Urmana’s impassioned, strongly sung Leonora, looking uncomfortable on opening night, will undoubtedly gather strength during the run. Marie-Ange Todorovitch’s delightful, if small-scale, Gallic Preziosilla gives considerable pleasure. Otherwise, it is another ROH clinker. They are accumulating.

His task is to repair a damaged Erard grand piano, which had been transported at the request of the unconventional commander Anthony Carroll, whose peace-keeping armoury figures medicine, music and poetry.Saddled with the linear march of time in the stage medium, Nigel Osborne’s music, to a libretto by Amanda Holden, inevitably cannot match Mason’s carefully coloured characters, nor the gradual unfolding of the story. But the opera brings alive the confluence of musics and cultures, with references to Bach’s The Well-Tempered Clavier, a bird dance of the Shan people and music for a Burmese puppet-show. Osborne also creates a greater significance for the piano itself by muting it. Drake’s piano recital for a peace conference is here imagined by the orchestra.In this premiere of the opera it seemed that conductor Michael Rafferty and his players had still to work Osborne’s sound world into the fingers and ears. But Giles Davies makes a smooth and richly-toned Drake and Steven Gallop a convincing if overly-eccentric Anthony Carroll. If Emily Bauer-Jones’s rather coreless singing as Drake’s wife Katherine failed to impress, Donna Bateman’s seductive Khin Myo almost bordered on the virtuosi.

A rousing show crammed with operatic delights – and a fire scare that cleared the theatre of its capacity audience while three fire engines attended.After a 20-minute break, the show continues, as dramatic on stage as it had been off. The 40-strong chorus, backed by full orchestra conducted by chorus master Donald Nally, gives more than 20 operatic highlights – classic to modern, lollipops to rareties.Handel to Sondheim, Verdi to Gershwin, Wagner to Bizet, Puccini to Bernstein, this is chorus work acted and sung with conviction and power.Director David Pountney keeps the action free-flowing, with touches of skittish humour, as each contrasting item, announced and translated on the surtitle screen, edges into the next with scarcely a break.The lush red and black setting, reminiscent of music hall, and the imaginative costumes are designed by Niki Turner. The atmospheric lighting is the work of Neil Austin, while back projection images adds to the visual impact.This touring show’s declared object is to introduce opera to wider audiences. Patrons – including reviewers – were asked to bring a first-timer. I took one of my grand-daughters, 12-year-old Sophie.

With its blend of sheer theatrical panache and a clever presentation of the work’s central battle between good and evil, this production seems set to restore Gounod’s warhorse to a prime position in the London repertory. Even if, as here, the new cast doesn’t quite match the star-studded line-up of the original.John Tomlinson’s Mephistopheles reveals the comic side of the devil well but the sinister side is far less in evidence. His voice has definitely seen better days. Elena Kelessidi is an uneven Marguerite, not quite in focus dramatically and without some of the necessary vocal sparkle. Dalibor Jenis is a good solid Valentin, with enough beefy tone to do credit to his big aria.Katija Dragojevic sings the young lad Siebel without distinction. But Della Jones gives great value in her largely comic turn as Dame Marthe and Matthew Rose is an accomplished Wagner.Where this production really does offer something vocally extraordinary is in the Faust of Polish tenor Piotr Beczala. A good actor, his tone is simply glorious and he brought the house down with ‘Salut, demeure’. A star, I think, is born.Maurizio Benini conducts an orchestra and chorus on top form and gives a broadly dramatic account of the marvellously theatrical score.

The bare stage made claustrophobically intimate by encroaching movable slate grey walls designed by Christian Ratz, the drab grey to black costumes of Etienne Couleon, the absence of furniture and props save for the chair of power and the all-dominating sacrificial knife, place focus remorselessly on the exposed performers.And what a performance they project of this significantly trendsetting opera. Ann Murray gives a towering portrayal of anguish in the title role as she makes heartbreaking choices of who lives and who dies, wrestling with the eternal themes of conflict between private belief and public duty.Matching her in passion, raw and earthy, are the Furies-haunted Oreste of Andrew Schroeder and the faithful unto death Pylade of Paul Nilon, with fine support from David Kempster as King Thoas and Camilla Roberts as the goddess Diana, whose mercy washes away the Euripidean guilts.The stillness, the simplicity of movement, the stylised ensembles of the individualised on-form Greek chorus are as impressive as they are powerful.In his UK debut, conductor Michael Hofstetter balances expertly the violence of the opening storm and the emotional climaxes with the beautiful purity and endless melody of Gluck’s last and arguably greatest score.This co-production with Opera Zuid is sung in French with English surtitles by Simon Rees.

1445,Bluebeard’s Castle review at Sadlers Wells London,https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2004/bluebeard-s-castle-review-at-sadlers-wells-london/,Bluebeard’s Castle,Sadlers Wells London,Bluebeard’s Castle review at Sadlers Wells London,,2004-10-11,Edward Bhesania,"Bartok’s only opera, to a libretto by Bela Balazs, is an intensely claustrophobic drama played out by only two characters, Duke Bluebeard and his new wife Judith. The inward looking scenario, in which Judith convinces Bluebeard to allow her to unlock the secrets hidden behind the seven doors in his castle, makes it an effective work, even in the concert hall.But Hungarian National Opera’s production at Sadler’s Wells, directed by Andras Miko, brings simply to life the dark, ‘weeping’ castle walls, a series of painted fabric panels, which rise in no particular order, to represent the opening doors. Onstage you see the effect of the symbolically coloured light associated with each opened door, especially the golden light behind the treasury (third door), accompanied with twinkling celesta and in this case the too bright daylight of the climactic fifth day. Suddenly Judith and Bluebeard are over-exposed and seem to leave the claustrophobia of the castle – not what was intended.Andrea Melath is a convincing Judith, initially a naive newly wed, who quickly learns fear but remains dutifully loyal to Bluebeard. Her soprano is dependable and articulate making the best of Bartok’s speech-based phrasing. Peter Fried’s Bluebeard is detached but clearly in love and vocally commanding, though he could do with more lyricism in his aria-like tribute to his former three wives, before all four disappear through the last door.

It is certainly not a production for purists, though.The 17th-century Sevillian setting has been updated to a bleak contemporary, urban now and blood, sex, drugs and expletives splurge through the evening. If the yobbish stereotypes are sometimes overplayed, the violence and misogyny compellingly reveal what Bieito clearly sees as the depraved characters’ dysfunctional relationships. There is some passion-wagon action with Giovanni and Anna at the start; Leporello sexually torments Elvira during his catalogue aria; and Masetto distracts himself with a leggy dancer while Zerlina is trying to appease him in the bar. That is just how these people are. But there is maybe one head meeting one crotch too many and, in the realism of the violence, the feel of a fawning homage to Tarantino.The singers gel the whole thing together remarkably and none is out of their depth. Mark Stone, a reckless Don Giovanni, puts his helter-skeltering life on hold in a winsome ‘La ci darem la mano’. His Leporello, Iain Paterson, is a suitably yobbish, though long-suffering, side-kick. The three female singers – Linda Richardson’s powerful Donna Anna, Mary Plazas’s impassioned Donna Elvira and Victoria Simmonds’s sexy Zerlina – are all well sung. And on top of it all, David Parry extracts keenly balanced phrasing and pacing from the ENO orchestra on excellent form. If worst comes to worst you could just close your eyes and listen, but you are bound to be compelled by the mayhem and moral destruction on stage.

Such touches have, perhaps surprisingly, added to its tremendous emotional impact. Here is one of WNO’s most powerful presentations – the chorus is at its rousing best and the on-form orchestra, conducted by Puccini specialist Julian Smith, fully exploits the dazzling range of orchestral strength and colour.This is no lavish spectacle with remote principals lost in vast Oriental scenery but very human relationships set in an inhuman modern society. Paul Steinberg’s claustrophobic corrugated iron semi-circular setting is dominated by scores of mugshots of the icy Princess’ beheaded suitors. The impassive Chinese peasantry observe the unfolding drama in impressively visual ensembles before errupting into those thrilling choruses.How refreshing to see a really feminine Turandot, slight of build, with presence, power and range that makes Francesca Patane so truly memorable as she reluctantly succumbs to the power of love. The ever-confident macho Calaf of Rafael Rojas is excellent, while the Liu of Olga Mykytenko, so fragile and moving in her self-sacrifice, is a portrayal to be treasured. Fine support from Ilya Bannik as Timur and Paul Gyton as the Emperor.Wigs and makeup by Peter Owen and lighting by Heather Carson contribute significantly to the menacing atmosphere, lightened only by the comic bureaucratic trio of Ping, Pang and Pong of Matthew Hargreaves, Philip Lloyd Holtam and Anthony Mee.

Miller returns to direct this revival, dispensing with designer names.The men come off rather better than the women, with Ferrando and Guglielmo, at first sharp-suited, returning in disguise as droopy-moustachioed hippy rock musicians. But their fiancees Dorabella and Fiordiligi look like would-be ladies who lunch, dressed up for the village fete. Because the two sisters blend so unremarkably into the single, all-cream set, it is difficult to believe either in their moral dilemma – whether to yield to their disguised fiances’ advances – or in their limp excitement over renewed male attention.Thankfully Thomas Allen’s Don Alfonso and Nuccia Focile’s Despina leap out from the stage. Everything about Allen, vocally and dramatically, is assured and he holds his qualities as cynical philosopher and gleeful trickster in careful balance, the extremes brought together with a sheen of suaveness. For her part, Focile, bouncingly characterised, brightly cuts through the grease of the sisters’ indecision.American tenor Charles Castronovo makes an impressive debut as Ferrando, though his smooth, attractive but light tenor takes some time to warm up. He is a good partner to Christopher Maltman’s predictably satisfying Guglielmo, together forming a handsome pair.Several minor ensemble glitches aside, Stephane Deneve directs his forces with skilfully elicited detail, also drawing out the heartache which tends to be muted by the production’s visual flatness.

Parallels with contemporary America are purposefully drawn and Jones’ occasional shock tactics – such as when Hector’s bloody corpse rises out of an office chair to confront Aeneas – retain their power to challenge and provoke.The production is immeasurably strengthened by the new casting of Sarah Connolly as Dido. Her noble tone and regal bearing are steadily undercut by the subtly charted emotional opening-up of the character to a vulnerability that will lead to her doom. Dido’s predicament has rarely been presented with such vital engagement.Another strong newcomer is Brindley Sherratt, whose voicing of Hector’s Ghost (Darren Ellis mimes the role) is a highlight. Anna Burford sings Dido’s sister Anna persuasively.Susan Bickley continues to make the prophetess Cassandra the dominating presence of the Trojan scenes, ably supported by Robert Poulton’s Chorebus and Gerard O’Connor’s Priam. John Daszak’s Aeneas holds the two halves of the evening together but vocally it is a struggle at times. More lyricism and more sheer power are needed.The entire score, indeed, needs a good deal more electricity and punch than conductor Paul Daniel provides but orchestra and chorus have a good evening. Not a consistently great Trojans, then, but an appreciable achievement nevertheless.

Newcomers to the Royal Opera House, or even to opera itself, will have started right at the top with this outstanding staging.Massenet’s opera – the tale of a sensitive soul who commits suicide because of his hopeless love for a married woman – combines the heights of late-Romantic passion with close attention to the most delicate shades of feeling. It’s quintessentially French.The cast manage the style and the text beautifully. Argentinean tenor Marcelo Alvarez cuts a fine Romantic figure as the doomed poet and sings with resource and range. He triumphs in the role.As the vulnerable Charlotte, who marries a dull husband instead, Romanian mezzo Ruxandra Donose presents a deeply moving portrait, perfect in its understatement. French baritone Ludovic Tezier makes a consistent study out of the worthy, increasingly resentful Albert, and the British contingent of Sally Matthews as Charlotte’s younger sister Sophie and Jonathan Veira as her bourgeois father flesh out the picture effectively.To immaculate and atmospheric period designs by Charles Edwards, Benoit Jacquot’s staging goes to the heart of the work and reveals its emotional depths slowly but surely. The evening is crowned by the masterly conducting of Antonio Pappano, whose flawless command of Massenet’s style ensures that the score registers as genuinely distinguished.

There is also a demon enemy, who is inevitably roundly defeated.It is a complex saga that needs a clearer narrative thread than David Lan’s libretto provides. Diction is also not good on this occasion. The most memorable parts of Dove’s score are those where he pastiches other styles – John Adams, neo-classical Stravinsky, a touch of Ravel, even Fiddler on the Roof. Any personality of his own registers far less strongly.Some of Alexander Lowde’s designs are clever – the giant fish is a particular success. Conductor Tim Murray keeps the show on the musical road, though John Fulljames’s direction is better at marshalling the forces than at creating credible characters. Despite which, James Laing’s stillness and sweet countertenor make an impact as the Angel, and the other principals are amiably efficient. It is probably more fun to take part in than to experience as a member of the audience.

It has been a long wait. With its high-flown drama – based on a play by Victor Hugo – flamboyant arias and rich ensembles, together with its colourful orchestral writing, the work registers as a masterpiece on this occasion.Indeed there are only two criticisms – firstly that there are so few performances and secondly that the piece is not staged. The cast itself could scarcely be bettered.In the hugely demanding title role, former mezzo Violeta Urmana may not quite convince as a soprano but her power and commitment shine in every note she sings. As her rival Laura, the Bulgarian Mariana Pentcheva gives as good as she gets, while the part of Gioconda’s blind mother La Cieca emerges as a star role in the sumptuous tones of American Jill Grove.The men are just as formidable. The man in the middle of the love triangle, Enzo, is sung with endless supplies of liquid tone by Marcello Giordani. Tackling the villainous spy Barnaba is Romanian Alexandru Agache, who here gives arguably his finest performance yet in London. Not to be outdone, let alone outsung, Eric Halfvarson lifts the roof as Laura’s cruel husband Alvise.Directing the musical forces with supreme command is Antonio Pappano, whose spirited musicality ensures a thoroughly idiomatic and genuinely thrilling performance of an undervalued score. When can we have the full staging?

Annilese Miskimmon’s misconceived staging of Handel’s and Congreve’s sublime comedy is terminally dreadful, the work of a director apparently wholly ignorant of stagecraft.She fails to get characters on and off stage naturally, too often places important moments upstage, destroys the impact of arias by distracting furniture removal and ruins Semele’s “Myself I shall adore” with a naffly cavorting dancer, while her inability to unfold a clear narrative is further compromised by conceptual idiocies.She disinters the hoary old chestnut of backstage tantrums and here sets it in the twenties/thirties. Jupiter becomes a famous conductor whose wife Juno determinedly puts paid to his philandering. A trucked proscenium arch hints at fantasy and reality. The fantasy remains locked in Miskimmon’s muddled imagination, the reality was a dog.The deadly seriousness of the direction torpedoes the comedy. Semele is made so drab and droopy that Jupiter’s infatuation becomes a nonsense. “Oh ecstasy of happiness”, she sings with a funereal expression, so Miskimmon has him soon after eye up her sister Ino.Who the characters are remains a mystery as unfathomable as Miskimmon’s take on Congreve’s ending, where Apollo promises “future happiness” dispensed by the offspring of Jupiter and Semele. Instead she has the chorus dismember the child as they sing “Happy, happy shall we be”.The staging leaves Christian Curnyn’s exhilarating reading with the excellent Southbank Sinfonia in dramatic limbo but, more damagingly and inexcusably, betrays the talents of the young performers by cannibalising Handel’s masterpiece to satisfy ego. A depressing and disgraceful occasion.

The QEH is not, however, an ideal venue for a score whose surging pantheism may undermine words even in an acoustic-friendly opera house.Fortunately, BYO opted for Jonathan Dove’s finely tuned instrumental reduction of the score, with augmented strings. Alexander Ingram conducted a lithe, urgent reading of translucent textural clarity which was always considerate to the singers.Designer Nicky Shaw’s three terraced levels defining forest, no-man’s-land and the world of humans cleverly overcame the hall’s stage limitations so that Stephen Medcalf was able naturally to bring dramatic fluidity to the narrative.Further, his staging was rich in enchanting detail – the dapper Mosquito, with walking cane as proboscis, OD-ing on the Gamekeeper’s blood. The Cricket and the Grasshopper with Zimmers. The Cock supplying the Hens with egg-boxes – the whole episode was both hilarious and upsetting, their demise registered by red polo-necks yanked to the chin.The marriage of Lucy Crowe’s mettlesome Vixen and Malin Christensson’s sporty Fox climaxed a beautifully handled courtship in which both sang with soaring phrasing and gleaming tone.Others who impressed were Kevin Kyle doubling as a touching, Chaplinesque Schoolteacher and the spiv Mosquito, James Robinson’s firm-voiced Priest, and Shuna Sendall’s Innkeeper’s Wife, who really made her few words tell. Which could not be said of David Stout’s Gamekeeper. He sang with warm tone but few words came across – black marks.Medcalf forged the youthful cast into an impressive ensemble.

Jason Pennycooke’s fizzing Mr Sands compered but also engineered a romance between fans Sam and Mary, the touching Mick Turner and Yvonne Powell.Psychedelic touches characterised Hendrix’s pad, where the Thomas Gray Band played their tributes to the remarkable guitarist, a salon environment epitomised Handel’s home, within which the rival divas Francesca Cuzzoni and Faustina Bordoni – the excellent Katherine Manley and Rowan Fenner – hilariously slugged it out vocally.Relton lightly yet lovingly sketched in the exceptional qualities of the two lives, capturing something of the spirit of their times. Handel’s funeral was movingly choreographed, the divas duetting ‘De torrente’ from Dixit Dominus, the homeless chorus as mourners distilling the sorrow of the occasion.There was a smoochy version of Hendrix’s Purple Haze, while the divas invaded the band to belt out the lyrics of Voodoo Chile with Handel band director Laurence Cummings in tow. He later joined Gray crisply duetting Happy We with Cuzzoni.The inspiriting enterprise also became a harsh, if unintended, condemnation of the Millenium Dome opposite, a fraction of whose wasted millions would have alleviated the plight of the homeless here performing with such dedication and delight.

So it is with Mario Martone’s production of Rossini’s ‘melodramma giocoso’ – there is plenty of the latter.Sergio Tramonti’s spectacular, allusive setting incorporates twin spiral staircases which intertwine and revolve to predicate entrapment at both emotional and narrative levels by the simplest, most striking means.Pole-axed by Matilde’s charms, Corradino’s bewildered capitulation is heightened in the coruscating Act I finale by their revolving and Martone’s circular choreographing of the mayhem among the principals. It typifies his tight grip on the implications of both the libretto and Rossini’s irresistible score.He is helped by an outstanding cast. Juan Diego Florez goes from strength to strength, his misogynist Count hilariously going to pieces as Matilde deploys her captivating wares. His delivery of the exacting coloratura is exhilarating, his realisation of Rossini’s demands exemplary.Annick Massis is the delectable Matilde. The voice may not be large but her projection is impeccable, the shaping of ‘fioriture’ effortless, her characterisation deft, relaxed and bewitching.As the sympathetic Aliprando, Marco Vinco establishes himself as an outstanding character bass and sexy to boot. Bruno di Simone endearingly underplays the hack poet Isidoro, while Carlo Lepore is a full-voiced Ginardo. Hadar Halevy’s fearless Edoardo fully commands the vocal line.Riccardo Frizza conducts a fizzing account of Rossini’s gripping score, with the Galician orchestra on cracking form. Bliss.

Happily, Emilio Sagi’s revived semi-staging is cleverly conceived to animate the ensembles yet gives enough freedom to performers to display their skills in set pieces.This year’s crop of young hopefuls may lack the vocal allure of previous years but musically they exhibit the academy’s highest standards. David Allegret’s Conte di Liebenskopf, though tonally reedy, confidently rips into the coloratura unfazed by the high tessitura.His duet/scena with Clara Mouriz’s Marchesa Melibea was touching yet erotic. Her mezzo is small and a touch muzzy but she shapes her music most sensitively. Luigi de Donato’s bass is perhaps too lightweight for Don Profondo but with what verve and wit he delivers ‘Io! Don Profondo’.By contrast Hye-Sun Ma’s Contessa de Folleville traverses the staves with enviable technical agility but the lower register is weak and her acting stiff. Two singers stand out for their already fully achieved sense of style, firm vocal support, warm-centred tone and relaxed command of the stage. Alexandra Zabala, the roguish Corinna, moulded ‘Arpa gentil’ with unmawkish, loving care and finessed the advances of Cavalier Belfiore with an impish wit.Ferdinand von Bothmer, the Belfiore, is a Rossini tenor with heft who still commands the taxing fioriture. He is a wonderfully laid-back performer who never over-plays the comedy. Lanfranco Marcelletti, who conducted the Bologna orchestra in a jaunty reading, was fully supportive of his appreciative young singers.

The setting is classical, pillars and masonry chunks rising, falling and sliding off stage to characterise various locales. The narrative unfolds cleanly, unfussily.In 1999, Daniela Barcellona’s radiant and valorous Tancredi stunned audiences into rapturous applause. A star was born. The same may be said of Marianna Pizzolato, the Tancredi of the current revival.Her stocky hero sings with an impassioned ardour, the divisions well integrated, the tone lustrous with a touch of bronze in the lower register. Pizzolato fully commands the taxing vocal line, colouring and moulding it to give full meaning to words – ‘Di tanti palpiti’ was exquisitely shaped. Here is a fine young artist.Patrizia Ciofi is already an international treasure, her gleaming soprano enchanting the ear, who invests the music with an astonishing range of nuances. Runs and decorations always sensitively illumine text. ‘Giusto Dio’ is a gripping display of her art. She is a mettlesome yet affecting Amenaide, intensely moving in the prison scene.The men are not quite on the same level, though Gregory Kunde negotiates Argirio’s taxing part with natural agility, giving due weight to words and presenting a father more troubled than tyrannical. Marco Spotti’s handsome Orbazzano deploys a magnificent bass rather too loudly. Anna Chierichetti throws off Roggiero’s little aria with a relaxed charm.Victor Pablo Perez conducts a well-paced, dramatic reading notable for clean textures and rhythmic vitality.

This year it offers Stefano Pavesi’s racy one-acter, whose libretto Jacopo Ferretti pillaged in shaping his own for Matilde de Shabran, which climaxes this year’s festival.Pavesi’s librettist Gaetano Rossi concocts a tight, heroic-comic drama exploiting a fashionable plot of the period. The bewitching Elena here brings to heel the misogynist misanthrope Corradino. The vengeful Isaura, in love with him, heightens the drama while the penurious poet Timoteo defuses it by providing light relief.This is not a lost masterpiece but Pavesi composes fluently, binding together the many succinct and always pleasing arias and ensembles with recit which never outstays necessity. He matches his librettist’s brevity and concision so that the work hurtles along exuberantly.The design motif of dead wood bringing forth flowers as Elena thaws the uptight Corradino is ingeniously and wittily sustained, though Damiano Michieletto’s staging is overly busy, two grotesque servants regularly upstaging the singers, whose acting veers towards the coarse.Though Annamaria Dell’oste’s Elena verges on the shrewish, she gives the most rounded performance, Giovanni Botta’s preening Corradino running her a close second.However, both exemplify the cast’s tendency to over-project, so that tone lacks bloom. They sing at a consistent forte, while runs are sometimes smudged or sketchy. More vocal control would result in more polished singing. Antonino Fogliani keeps the orchestra on its toes.

He did just that with Elisabetta, a work so stunningly original as to have knocked the sceptical Neapolitans off their critical perches.Giovanni Schmidt’s libretto may be rather stiffly written but its pageant-like progress comprises expertly crafted scenes linked by concisely conceived recitative which Rossini dramatises with astonishing orchestral accompaniments – note the agitated strings beneath Elisabetta’s first meeting with the treacherous Norfolk.The virtuoso San Carlo orchestra enabled the composer to pen some of his most daring music. Norfolk’s betrayal of Leicester to the Queen seethes with outlandish harmonies intensified by rhythmic unrest. And Leicester’s prison scene opens with disconcerting modulations which ease into remarkable yet ravishing scoring for pairs of piccolo and cor anglais.Rossini’s vocal writing acquires an expressive virtuosity which subtly delineates character, especially when sung with the sensitive technical assurance of Sonia Ganassi’s imperious yet vulnerable Elisabetta and of Antonino Siragusa’s saurian Norfolk.Hardly less impressive is the young Mariola Cantarero’s Matilde, whose vibrant mezzo encompasses the vertiginous, wide-ranging part with enviable ease. Bruce Sledge is an imposing Leicester.Renato Palumbo conducts an at times over-affectionate reading. Daniele Abbado’s hieratic staging within a metallic enclave of tiered levels and platforms generates a genuinely conspiratorial atmosphere but seems too often in thrall to the setting, so that groupings are more picturesque than meaningful.

She is tall and willowy and her sinuous, seductive Carmen manages to convey languor as well as provocation in a highly charged piece in a harsh, urban setting. She moves effortlessly from rhapsodic pas de deux with the Toreador (Nerijus Juska) and Don Jose (Edvardus Smalakys) to disjointed, staccato movement that is full of foreboding.The percussive music – especially the drums, xylophone and chimes, and pizzicato from the strings – matches the movement impeccably. Staging is minimalist and lighting atmospheric, with rectangles and pools of light to isolate moments of high tension. An almost upright board creates a bed that yields some dramatic cameos and the sudden descent of a blood-red curtain for the bullring is startling and shocking. A brilliant piece, remarkable too for the angular and anguished dancing of the crowd.After this bold and uncompromising ballet, Don Quixote Act 3 comes as something of an anticlimax, a bit like following a substantial main course with a light and frothy dessert. There is not much of the burlesque in this conclusion to the story, so that the variations are little more than a string of set pieces that leave the audience wanting more. That said, they are stunningly danced.

Relaxed and confident, Israeli mezzo Rinat Shaham has the dark good looks and physical allure to shine as the gypsy and her medium-weight voice contains all the sensual colours required. She is top of the range.Partnering her is Paul Charles Clarke’s tense and unlovable Don Jose. He too supplies the necessary vocal weight but his tendency to sharpen, or to allow the tone to bulge at the ends of phrases, gives Bizet’s elegant lines a bumpy ride. He is dramatically monochrome, not charting clearly enough the character’s descent from fascination to murderous obsession.Michelle Canniccioni is another singer whose tone spreads uncomfortably but her good-girl Micaela is well integrated into the bigger picture. Polish baritone Wojtek Drabowicz swaggers impressively as Escamillo, his tone building powerfully throughout the Toreador’s Song. There are neat and effective studies in some of the smaller parts, especially Jeremy Carpenter’s laid-back Morales and Jonathan Best’s rank-pulling Zuniga.The kids’ chorus get a bit out of hand – they’re a bit too Lionel Bart – and Paolo Carignani’s conducting, while spirited, lacks definition. But visually there is more than enough to compensate. Andrew George’s choreography smoulders and McVicar’s direction is crisp and alert. Especially successful is the final act, with the brilliance of the bullfighters’ parade succeeded by the fatal emotional duel in the Seville sun. This is a Carmen built to last.

The Protagonist’s unstable grip on real life results in his sister’s death. In Royal Palace, Dejanira rejects the attempts of three men – husband, past lover and future lover – to foist their needs on her, choosing instead to walk transfigured into the lake beside the luxury hotel where they besiege her.Nicolas Brieger gives both works brilliant stagings, though he cheapens the pantomimes of Der Protagonist with hard-core cliches and introduces improvisations which vitiate dramatic momentum. However his handling of Royal Palace, a work conceived as multi-media and well ahead of its time, is masterly.There is an exhilarating imaginative brilliance to the dances, film sequences, projections and design which illumines without exaggeration. Memorable images abound – the lakeside with flying birds, the filmed montage of Dejanira’s world travels, the filmed hands groping her live body, the food projections on the dancing bellboys’ trays.The superb ensemble cast act and sing with a truth, accuracy and urgency which overwhelm and move, especially Catherine Nagelstadt, Gerhard Siegel and Peter Bording. Yakov Kreizberg’s crystalline, incandescent realisation of both scores with the Wiener Symphoniker is the stuff of dreams. An unforgettable experience.

The cast may not provide world class voices but what superb ensemble they achieve and how passionately involved they all are.Fuchs sets the piece in the late sixties/early seventies, swiftly establishing the crucial hierarchy. Count Walter becomes a powerful magnate capable of rustling up riot police, Wurm his grey-suited hatchet man. Luisa’s simple flower-print frock instantly defines her modest status.Fuchs unerringly demonstrates how money and power will ruthlessly manipulate and destroy the less fortunate while extracting the fullest drama from the four men’s mounting emotional and self-serving demands upon the hapless Luisa, which crush her every hope of a life, love and happiness.Designer Jamie Vartan provides an impressive curved wall of wide wood panels which fold back to reveal interiors of Walter’s expensive home, a single chair marooned in a vast space representing the simple world of Luisa and her father.Anne Sophie Duprels’ mettlesome Luisa goes down fighting, her vibrant full-voiced soprano shaping the melodies with due care for words. Her scenes with Alan Oke’s strongly song, anguished Rodolfo move and harrow.  Richard Angas is a steely, black-voiced Walter, Paul Reeves a lubricious Wurm. A pity Mark Holland’s sympathetic Miller is vocally rather wild and unfocussed.Peter Robinson conducts a superbly judged, dramatic reading in which every facet of Verdi’s remarkable score tells without overwhelming the singers. A wonderful evening.

Jonas Vaitkus delivers it  uncompromisingly as a choral work with almost no physical interaction between the protagonists and total impassivity from the great serried ranks of soldiers and slaves. The only thing that could be described as movement comes from the two handmaidens of the false idol, who dance in a high-stepping and stylised way around the winged presence.But the power and discipline of the 70-strong chorus is awesome. It reaches its pinnacle in the Chorus of the Hebrew slaves, which fades into utter stillness but their rising and falling as one as Nabucco proclaims himself God and their slow, momentous procession towards the place of Fenena’s execution carry enormous weight and speak silent volumes about people in subjugation.Standing motionless side by side, the soloists pour out their passion to the audience, with outstanding performances from Dainius Stumbras as Nabucco and Sigute Stonyte as the scheming Abigaille, his supposed elder daughter.  Stumbras’ rich baritone is especially suited to the passionate pleading of the prayer to Jehovah in Act IV, while Stonyte displays both a formidable technical mastery and an imperious stage presence. The deepest bass notes from Vladimiras Prudnikovas as Zaccaria, the high priest, seem to come from the bowels of the earth.There is no set, but dazzling costumes and headgear fill the void. And full praise for the orchestra for such a consistent and accomplished performance.

The comic vein continues with the bumbling Bartolo (David Woloszko) and the razor-sharp facial, physical comic acting of Aled Hall’s Don Basilio. The only straight-comic disappointment is the drunk gardener Antonio’s cameos, which were under-sung by Darron Moore.But the tragic-comedy element was also fully revealed by a winsome Cherubino, sung by Zoe Todd. As well as looking the part of a grubby, testosterone-fuelled adolescent boy, she well portrayed the anguish of Cherubino’s love for the Countess  – on whose lips she defiantly plants a kiss before being ejected from her chamber in Act I. And Todd was convincingly passionate towards Stephanie Bosworth’s attractive and well sung Barbarina. The central quartet of characters worked well. Richard Burkhard as a charming, sometimes boyish Figaro, capable of comedy and ferocity, Sarah Redgwick’s Susannah, who lights up the stage despite a rather frumpy black frock in Act I, Kate Ladner displays vocal and emotional richness as the Countess and Mark Stone’s Count demonstrates jealousy and violence, sharpened by a suave undercurrent.Jeremy Silver drew expressive lines from the City of London Sinfonia and was acutely sensitive to the relationship between music and mood – not least in the Countess’ heartfelt ‘Porgi, amor’ – but he failed to draw the sparkle and precision often required of the players.

The Ancient Egyptian setting is dramatic with its elevated tomb structure and great wall of angled mirrors. The lighting suffuses the whole in atmospheric washes of green and silver, orange and blood-red.Jurasas has a keen eye for how to arrange his mighty cast on this set for maximum impact. The first of many thrilling moments comes with the great chorus for victory at the temple of Vulcan in Act I and culminates in the inspirational Gloria all’Egitto that closes the first half – a feast for the eye as well as a joy to listen to.Irena Milkeviciute is a powerful Aida, a seasoned artist who brings huge passion to the role in all its diversity and especially in the scenes with her father, Amonasro – sung and acted by the baritone Vytautas Juozapaitis with urgency and conviction. Inesa Linaburgyte is a magnificent Amneris, the Pharaoh’s daughter and Vytautas Kurnickas creates a strong and compelling Radames.There are many theatrical moments to savour as well as the great hymns to the gods and the solo laments – Amneris’s taunting of Aida with a snake, the epic parade of the prisoners and throwing down of the banners, the chilling condemnation of Radames by the priests and the final burial alive, physically suggested by the appearance of a pyramid and sung by Aida and Radames in some of the most lyrical and uplifting words of the opera.

Yet it is undoubtedly one of the greatest musical dramas in the English language.The score must have sounded hair-raisingly modern to early 18th century ears, with its chromaticisms and dissonances. Just listen to the unsettling ‘Jealousy’ chorus, or Iole’s ‘My father!’ before she eases into the sublime ‘Peaceful rest’.Harry Christophers guides the period band through a moving reading of this extraordinary score. Though he starts with measured tread, his sure pacing intensifies its inexorable progress towards Hercules’ harrowing death and Dejanira’s mad scene as she wrestles with “the pursuing Furies of the mind”.Yvonne Howard grippingly delivers this astonishing scene. She does full justice, vocally and dramatically, to Handel’s astute psychological depiction in music of this imperious yet unhappy wife, whose chimerical jealousy leads to her husband’s death. It is a subtly built portrayal.Aidan Lang’s direction also draws fine performances from Eric Owens, the amiable Hercules, whose way with a flinty Dejanira is to win her round with gentle clowning, and from Gillian Keith, whose mettlesome Iole sings with sweet, centred tone.Lang cleverly uses the sparky young chorus to create a court community whose more mundane lives bring humanity to those they serve. Deirdre Clancy’s flying canvases depicting Hercules’ involvement with Nessus provide ironic commentary while sustaining tragic momentum. Lang’s is Handel staging at its finest.

The set has a burnished antiquity about it, fragments of buildings lend themselves to the spooky cemetery scenes as well as to the golden feasting of seventeenth century Seville.The master and servant relationship between Giovanni and Leperello is joyfully drawn by Vytautas Juozapaitis and Vladimiras Prudnikovas, in a pairing as familiar as old clothes. It is a double act of a villain so laid-back as to be almost horizontal and an accomplice whose comic recounting of his master’s conquests – “He even takes old ones, just to make up the numbers” – is one of the comic highlights of the first act.Donna Elvira has little to do in the early stages except display anguish and toss handkerchiefs but Irena Zelenkauskaite displays the full range and confidence of her voice in the passionate solo lament of Act II. Sigute Stonyte is droll as the peasant bride Zerlina, clutching an oversized plant pot in defence of the Don’s advances and there is a performance of quiet integrity from the tenor Audrius Rubezius as Don Ottavio.The staging is kept simple, making the most of centrepieces like a great wheeled horse and using candelabra like weapons in a dance of death. Just occasionally, the size of the space defeats them – there is a ripple of amusement as the Commendatore’s corpse appears for an third time in solemn procession – but nothing can take away the exhilaration of it all.

It centres around an imagined friendship that builds up around the Dada-influenced collagist-in-exile Kurt Schwitters and a young boy, based on their mutual fascination for bus tickets. While the boy collects them to bring order to his collection, for Schwitters they constitute elements of his abstract, chaotic artworks.The production, by Linsday Posner, heavily draws upon innovative video and graphics prepared by James Herbert, which can either set the context or the scene. The three main characters – Schwitters, the boy Michael and his mother – make a dynamically engaged, close-knit trio dramatically but the 19 scenes of the scenario are not always satisfyingly paced. The inclusion of a BBC interview for the third programme, in which Schwitters barely gets a word in, contributes little and there is a tedious degree of prosaic exchanges. But the opera does leave an impression of how Schwitters’ refreshing world view – virtuosically articulated in two sound-poems, mimicking a sneeze and a doodlebug – could win people over.The metrical rhythms of Nyman’s score are well handled by the Almeida Ensemble under Paul McGrath, although with some instruments amplified the singers occasionally sounded overshadowed. Which is a shame, as each of them – John Graham Hall as Schwitters, Vivian Tierney as the mother and treble William Sheldon as Michael – each put in convincing and strongly sung performances.

Tom Johnson works every rhythmic, chordal, intervallic, dynamic and linear angle in unfolding a surreal narrative that finds four singers trapped, Magritte-like, in his open-ended, imaginative world.The opera allows any director a field day. The last staging I saw was so killingly high camp that the audience appeared to suffer a collective hernia from laughing.Gavin Quinn’s version looked at first sight to be a vocal casualty ward, until one noticed that the temperature charts at the foot of the cast-iron beds consisted of pages of score. A nut-house, perhaps. As the quartet sang and cavorted their way through the explanatory choruses, solo arias and ensembles, each revealed characteristic traits.Buddug Verona James’ bracing Contralto developed into something of a bossy boots, while Nicola Sharkey’s svelte, kooky Soprano – she delivered a number squatting in a trash can – hinted at suppressed insecurities.Joe Corbett’s Baritone, with his wonderfully expressive bloodhound features, was a Buster Keaton clone wrestling an unkind Fate. Kevin West’s self-absorbed Tenor oscillated between the sarcastic and the manic, indulging in petulance, indifference, sulks and a whole range of emotional tics along the way.All four sang the four-note saga with an innate musicianship making much of the words, which pinged into the auditorium with a crystal clarity. Dearbhla Collins lit into the piano part with a gleeful perversity. Johnson’s deft comedy of entrapment came across as the little masterpiece it is.

Trust is broken, fidelity despised and the humiliation of others becomes a game.Rossini conveys this in arias and ensembles of surpassing beauty, of headlong rhythmic momentum, orchestrated with wit and clarity so as to reveal characters’ underlying tensions and pain and to pinpoint the crassness of their responses to each other and to situations.Turco careers inexorably towards Geronio’s banishing his errant wife Fiorilla from their home. In a moving and dramatic scena, she acknowledges her exploitive indifference towards him. It is a chastening moment, which, properly directed, cannot fail to strike home to audiences.Giles Havergal presumably believes Rossini is a mere virtuoso purveyor of riotous musical confections, so cuts this turning point in the opera. His misguided farrago of a staging is all cute garnish, hoary old visual gags, drama school impro effects – Selim’s ship arriving – and characters mugging to the hilt, notably Donald Maxwell’s embarrassingly awful Geronio.  Havergal reduces the characters to charmless cardboard ciphers.The singers belt out the music without much sensitivity, except Tim Mirfin, whose inky bass sings off words, confidently commands the coloratura and deftly moulds the vocal lines to fashion a randy yet likeable Selim. Wyn Davies conducts a lively reading of the score. Overall it is a grisly experience.

Best is his staging of Trouble in Tahiti, which is engaging but lacking in depth.Designer Soutra Gilmour provides metal tower constructs, which can be rearranged to designate place. They resemble a men’s locker room, which is fine for Sam’s office and gym scenes in the Bernstein, but they fail to illumine the other pieces. Natasha Chives lights unfussily.The swing trio sashay around inoffensively but they need a sharper edge. Fulljames lets the Sam and the Dinah do their own thing, though he directs Sam to strip and shower cockily in silhouette. Dinah’s send-up scena about the movie of the title goes for nothing, since too many words fail to make the auditorium.Richard Burkhard’s Neanderthal Sam belts out the notes but barely shows concern that his marriage to the vocally ill-tuned, rather dowdy Dinah is heading for the rocks. The men of the trio fail to blend with their mezzo colleague, Alison Kettlewell, who in all three works sings warmly off words.Conductor Patrick Bailey must take some blame for this vocal imbalance but is wholly responsible for the rather routine traversal of Bernstein’s lively, often touching, score, while his way with the Weill Singspiel is bizarre, being neither ironic nor distanced. Nor does Fulljames seem to have any grasp on Weill, the performers mostly standing around and singing very loudly. About the Tim Coker world premiere I shall remain tactfully silent.

As an ensemble piece it is an apt work in which to showcase the Royal Opera’s Vilar Young Artists. The Pierrot (representing Life) and Death were well sung, respectively, by Hubert Francis – a lightish, well-projecting tenor with diamond-cut consonants – and by bass Matthew Rose.Jared Holt as the Emperor suffered a little from being set further back into the stage, while his Drummer, mezzo-soprano Ekaterina Gubanova, was richly powerful and vocally athletic. The Soldier (James Edwards) wooed convincingly and Ha Young Lee gave one of the evening’s most arresting performances as the Girl, singing her post-Straussian imaginings of a better place with warmth and purity.Conductor Roland B?er (also a Vilar Young Artist) captured well the work’s quirky irony but could have drawn more immediacy from his ensemble. The same was true of David Syrus, as he conducted most of Act 1 from Mozart’s Cosi fan tutte.Vocally, Matthew Rose revelled in the role of Don Alfonso, the would-be master planner. Ailish Tynan’s Despina was on the hammy side and prone to breathy recitatives but was well executed. The sisters Fiordiligi and Dorabella (Victoria Nava and Tove Dahlberg) though vocally very different, still managed to blend in their duets. Jared Holt was more comfortable front-stage as Guglielmo but it was Andrew Kennedy as Ferrnado who stunned the audience with his ‘Un aura amorosa’. He has clarity tempered with a warmth and tone that never sounded forced. Proof here that Vilar Young Artists can develop artists and deliver performers ready for the international stage.

If there was a touch of Star Trek to the staging, it was very much in the spirit of the piece.The confident young chorus lit into their music with rhythmic gusto, full-bodied tone and unusually clear diction. Like the orchestra, they responded wholeheartedly to Michael Williamson’s firm grasp of the score’s relentless unfolding.Rachel Dyson and Katherine Price impressed as The Commander and Queen Isabella, their firm, centred sopranos caringly shaping the fractured vocal lines.

The man delivers a missive to the woman, which wakes her from her sleep. She writes a reply while he waits constantly outside her door.The set shows both the exterior and interior of the woman’s house, with the movements of the man and woman eerily mirrored by doubles. By repetition, these humdrum acts are elevated into ritual, playing out alongside music – for string quartet and bassett clarinet – of crushing plangency, which at the same time manages to acknowledge hard events such as the opening of the window blind or the letter dropping through the letterbox.As the seven cycles progress, we become more embedded in the Io myth. As the woman sleeps, masked characters play out the story in which Zeus seduces Io and is then afflicted by a gadfly, set upon her by Zeus’ jealous wife Hera. Myth and reality gradually converge, leading to a bizarrely escalated climax during which the man (Zeus) is transformed into the woman (Io) and inherits the affliction of the gadfly.This climax shunted absorbing, latent strangeness into the world of sharp surrealism. Despite this, The Io Passion is a brilliantly conceived hybrid of music and theatre, with sheerly beautiful playing by the Quatuor Diotima and clarinettist/music director Alan Hacker.

This is the final outing at Covent Garden of Franco Zeffirelli’s 1964 production after more than 230 performances.Age seems hardly to have withered the sumptuous remodelling of the spacious Baroque basilica of the Sant’Andrea della Valle, the claustrophobic, low-ceilinged, candle-lit apartment of Scarpia at the Palazzo Farnese or the imposing exterior of the Castel Sant’Angelo where Cavaradossi meets his death before Tosca jumps from the battlements. And given the stars who have graced this production down the years – Callas, Caball?, Domingo, Bergonzi, Gobbi – it is unsurprising that one or two of the current principals seem hesitant to stamp their mark.All starts well with Graeme Broadbent’s Angelotti and Henry Waddington’s Sacristan. Then Yu Qiang Dai (Cavaradossi) thrills us with his ‘Recondita armonia’, showing off a spinto tenor – not especially warm but heroically powerful at the upper extreme.Dramatically Maria Guleghina is an under-characterised Tosca – not especially the diva, not especially jealous of the affair she suspects Cavaradossi to be conducting and not especially coquettish when persuading him to emphasize her likeness in his painting. The absence of chemistry between them in their church scene is almost palpable.Similarly, a rather suave-sounding Samuel Ramey (Scarpia) seems not remotely lustful or scheming – especially surprising for someone who has made a speciality of Mephistophelean roles. His ultimatum to Tosca appears almost as an attempt at persuasion rather than the triumphant falling into place of the last piece of his grand design.Romanian-born Christian Badea conducts a Royal Opera Orchestra in good form – playing up the lyrical elasticity of Puccini’s score but passionately conveying the streaks of vivid colouring that underpin the lurid scenario.

Gossip thrives upon erroneous surmise. The current production, borrowed from La Monnaie and staged by a revival director, overrides this crucial imperative.In the prologue the borough’s citizenry have already ganged up against a coffin-clutching Grimes, his every move causing a surge of group fear born of certain knowledge. The production has nowhere to go. Grimes, characterised as villain, proceeds to fulfil that expectation.Willy Decker’s restrictive concept straitjackets Grimes, Ellen and Balstrode in characterisations with no room for development, yet Sarah Walker’s Mrs Sedley, consistently ridiculed and harried, can inexplicably unite the borough women behind her after Act II’s beautiful yet upsetting quartet, ‘From the gutter’. Where is the motivation?Mind you, John Macfarlane’s drab Expressionist settings, stormy designs and flats creating enclaves flatly lit by David Finn, never for a moment evoke a fishing village.Instead of dawn sequences when fisher-folk prepare for work, black-suited citizenry sit and sing off hymn-sheets. The dance (Act III) has them cavorting and rutting in animal masks. There is a single-minded anti-church emphasis whose subtext is, I suspect, Nazi mob instinct run riot. Of Britten’s more humane universe there remains not a trace.The company play the dreary travesty to the hilt. Antonio Pappano conducts an exciting, often too excitable, reading. Benn Heppner, vocally ill at ease sporadically, is an arresting Grimes. But it is Alan Opie’s generously sung Balstrode which distinguishes the evening.

Rachmaninov’s piece sets Pushkin’s tale of an avaricious count, whose refusal to support his intemperate son Albert leads to a fierce confrontation inducing a fatal heart attack.Though the subtly orchestrated score’s dark harmonies and rich textures provide a psychological sub-text to the portagonists’ inner lives, the piece remains wholly undramatic. However, the ever amazing Sergei Leiferkus’ singing and acting render the superb central scena for the count a gripping experience.Vladimir Jurowski guides the London Philharmonic in top form through a reading of vivid intensity. Their traversal of Puccini’s Gianni Schicchi is no less superb, its deft instrumentation and riotous momentum captured with playing of satisfying wit and power, Jurowski distilling its range of fraying emotions with unfailing insight.Annabel Arden’s direction of both works is refreshingly straightforward, though an aerialist representing possibly conscience or avarice is a quixotic feature of the Rachmaninov. Vicki Mortimer’s evocative, settings gain immeasurably from Paule Constable’s purposive yet unfussy lighting.As Schicchi, Alessandro Corbelli delivers a master-class in how to extract every ounce of humour from comedy by playing it straight, never mugging and singing off words always to illuminate character, never forcing the tone into ugliness for effect. He is the king of comedy and an international treasure.Sally Matthews and Massimo Giordano, the fresh-voiced young lovers Lauretta and Rinuccio, and Felicity Palmer, the endearingly fearsome Zita, remain always part of an enviable ensemble. A magical evening.

A collector of beach litter sorts scraps of paper into three groups: fragments seemingly relevant to himself, to others, and those incomprehensible to him.This enables Woolrich to mine a variety of texts to convey the collectors evolving state of mind – “These fragments have I shored against my ruin” – Emily Bronte, Paul Eluard and Robert Schumann amongst them. A fascinating idea.The excellent percussionist Richard Benjafield guided an instrumental band – two cellos, violin, harp, three clarinets and percussion – dramatically through the expressive score, its more aggressive, angst-ridden pages offset by moments of quiet repose and virtual stasis. The tone is urgent, concerned.However the soloist, Katalin Karolyi, projected words so poorly that the texts failed to mesh with the music. The work’s inner meanings could never surface. This lack was further compromised by the staging, if you could call it that.A dark gauze halved the stage diagonally, lined in front by a few box files and crumpled scraps of paper. The soloist walked on slowly in a shaft of light and sat at a table, where either she stared into space, held her head in her hands or consulted the vocal score. That was it.So why bother? ENO has demonstrated how effective stagings of non-operatic works can be. This limp affair failed utterly to serve or enhance Woolrich’s imaginative new work.

Updating the events to the twenties allows for chic black and white art deco sets and there is plenty of eye-candy at the ball scene, bristling with the glamorous party set.Alistair Beaton’s libretto and Hawkes’ direction are snappy yet self-deprecatory, with a very British feel that ranges across G&S, sitcom, slapstick and variety entertainment. The last shifts into top gear in Frosch’s drunk scene, delivered masterfully by Mark White, who apologises that there is no loo break here and offers a string of excruciating musical jokes. But his main role is to rake up a sense of moral scrutiny among the audience on the antics of the onstage bourgoisie.Fine comic acting also comes especially from the amorous Italian tenor Alfred (Bradley Daley), the maid Adele (Charlotte Page, playing as a cockney) and the foppish Eisenstein, whom Charles Johnston plays every bit like the entertaining but poignantly pathetic cad.Vocally, the only slight disappointment was Christine Bunning’s Rosalinde – not always comfortable in the higher regions – but Page is articulate and honey-voiced at all altitudes, Johnston sings as suavely and effusively as befits his stage character and Daley modestly masks his vibrant high tenor by losing himself in the comic role. John Owen Edwards conducts the City of London Sinfonia with a light touch that occasionally borders on imprecision but overall this is simply a belting night out.

Peter Rice’s set presents a truly Bohemian flat for Act I – these are typically messy male students – though quite what so many kids are doing there is anyone’s guess.The virtue of the staging lies in occasionally brilliant moments. The showbiz razzmatazz at the end of the Cafe Momus scene is great fun. It is much less good at defining character or relationships. All four flatmates seem pretty much the same bloke and there is little connection between Sean Ruane’s cuddly Rodolfo and Katarina Jovanovic’s Mimi, who remains the picture of rude health throughout until she inexplicably keels over in the final scene.Neither of the leading pair gives listeners an entirely comfortable evening. More consistent are Howard Quilla Croft’s emphatic Marcello, Riccardo Simonetti’s laid-back Schaunard and Timothy Dawkins’ Colline, whose rich and characterful bass is a major asset.Though slender of tone, Natasha Marsh provides a properly scene-stealing Musetta and Nicholas Folwell makes a good deal of his two cameos as Benoit and Alcindoro. And the kids are well trained as well as energetic.The City of London Sinfonia shows its mettle in Puccini’s brilliant orchestral writing and conductor Dominic Wheeler demonstrates keen sensitivity, except in allowing two hiatuses in Act I to give time for unscripted production business. They destroy the music’s momentum. Puccini would not have been amused.

Even designer Dody Nash’s projections are based on children’s drawings made during workshops.As operas, the resulting works – Firestone, based on the Creation, Dogfight from Cain and Abel and Animalarky a retelling of the Flood – have their faults. Words can be flat and the music unimaginative. Each piece is too long. Using the same story as Benjamin Britten in Noyes Fludde invites invidious comparisons.But at their best there is atmosphere and some magic. And as educational projects there is clearly a valuable result, with masses of enthusiastic young performers visibly enjoying the challenge of working in a great theatre on a professionally organised production. Let’s hope they continue to develop their talents.ENO has given them a fine launch, with quality professional singers engaged for the adult roles and Martin Fitzpatrick conducting a choice ensemble selected from the company’s regular orchestra and music staff.The material finally disappoints, but nothing is lacking in the preparation and presentation of the results. Three hundred kids have had a life-changing experience and you cannot argue with that.

Even the Marquis’ residence in the first scene is minimally furnished and in the convent we see either a bare stone-effect set or an opaque black-curtain backdrop. This helps to focus the desperate, internalised fear of the novice Blanche and throws into striking relief the levity of Sister Contance’s merry prattling. Once the first scene is over – none too soon, given the rather wooden exchange between the Marquis and his son – this performance gathers an inexorable momentum.Claire Turner as the dying Old Prioress sings with fine control while occupying a body wracked with pain. She sings movingly when entrusting Blanche to Mother Marie, and powerfully ambiguously – is it realisation or deliriousness? – when shouting out against God at her death. Klara Ek captures well the fragile, fearful and naive nature of Blanche, supported by the wonderfully light-voiced Malin Christensson (Sister Constance). Some of the most accomplished singing comes from Ana James as Madame Lidoine, the new Prioress. Her Act III aria, where she comforts her charges and later blesses them, is practically a showstopper, a magical cocktail of rich tone, touching expression and impressive power, never over-pushed at her thrilling top end. Matching this is the unfailingly beautiful chorus as the nuns depart, one by one, for the scaffold. Jan-Latham Koenig elicits thoroughly grown-up playing from the RCM students, picking out admirably both the sinew and the mystery in Poulenc’s score.

The plot is episodic but the lyrics – by Comden and Green – are as sassy as they come.It is a good choice for Grange Park’s annual foray into the world of musical theatre, though a challenging one. Director/designer Antony McDonald’s set, with its looming apartment blocks, provides a fine space for the intimate scenes and big set pieces to flourish in and its visual wit and period references keep the eye entertained.But some of the dialogue lacks pace and the trajectory of the first half, despite ending with the exuberant Conga! number, goes down, rather than up.Things pick up after the interval, with the amiably satirical parodies of the lovelorn Irish cops and the hepcats of the Vortex nightclub.Mary King gives an astute performance as budding writer Ruth but a part written for Rosalind Russell needs a bigger voice and a bigger personality. Sophie Daneman charms as ingenue sister Eileen and Graham Bickley does the business as hard-bitten editor Bob Baker, though here too a touch more tone is required. Mark Meadows delivers a likeable account of The Wreck.But the star of the evening is conductor Richard Balcombe, who gives the score an easy flow and comes up with some pzazz for the showstoppers.

This was the second of Rossini’s operas to reach the stage and the first of his full-length comedies. It has never had a British staging before.Its first production was pretty disastrous. Aged 19, the composer wrote the piece for Bologna in 1811. It was banned after three performances because it was too rude.The ‘strange misunderstanding’ of the title concerns the heroine, Ernestina, who – it is falsely put about – is a castrato in drag. The text is littered with doubles entendres. The censors saw red and that was that.It turns out to be well-worth doing. The basis of Rossini’s comic style is already here and the score bristles with clever ensembles.Director/designer Massimo Gasparon comes up with a high camp set and some extravagant costumes. Occasionally he goes over the top – having the male chorus appear in drag lowers the comic tone – but the cast rise above this level more often than they sink beneath it.Andrew Shore provides good value as Ernestina’s father Gamberotto, though his funny voices become wearisome. Henry Waddington flounces his way skilfully through the role of unwanted suitor Buralicchio. Darren Abrahams is impeccable as the scheming Frontino. Elena Belfiore’s Ernestina surmounts some vocal insecurities to deliver a winning performance and Colin Lee is fluent and appealing as her young tutor Ermanno.David Parry conducts a clean and lively account of this fascinating rarity. Rossini fans shouldn’t miss it.

The dapper troupe of fairies – the excellently trained members of Trinity Boys Choir – lead off the revels with sophisticated poise. The eventual arrival of Iain Paterson’s glammed-up Theseus and his equally spangly spouse Hippolyta (the classy Leah-Marian Jones) takes us into a more formal but equally theatrical setting.Visually, this is a wide-ranging and subtle account of Britten’s Shakespearean comedy and regularly entrancing in assistant director Emmanuelle Bastet’s crisp work on this revival.The scenes with the mechanicals come over with a tremendous comic verve, with Peter Rose’s ebullient Bottom never missing a trick. Emil Wolk’s mature Puck may be an unusual conceit but he’s as athletic as they come.The quartet of young lovers provides excellent ensemble playing and high-quality singing throughout. Linda Richardson’s Helena is particularly sparky.Robin Blaze’s Oberon capitalises on the unearthly quality of his counter-tenor tone and Sarah Tynan’s Titania is visually and aurally delectable.Diction is, however, patchy, which won’t really do with such a text to get over. And the lack of an interval after Act 1 makes the first half an extremely long haul.ENO’s music director Paul Daniel is always at his best in twentieth-century scores and this proves no exception. With the orchestra on strong form, the piece casts a powerful spell.

It is not a production that will frighten off traditionalists and it looks appealing even if it is short on definition and point. But at least there is no extraneous business and the audience can concentrate on the matter in hand.There is a likeable cast. Two talented young women – Sarah-Jane Davies and Wendy Dawn Thompson – do a creditable sister act as Fiordiligi and Dorabella and their singing is always secure if rarely sparky. Edgaras Montvidas manages a fluent and touching account of Ferrando, partnered by the punchier Guglielmo of American baritone Daniel Belcher in his UK debut.A hotel manager in Cox’s concept, the vocally able Jonathan Best sings Don Alfonso. Though we should be aware of him constantly manipulating the action, Cox rarely places him at the centre of things.The real star is Lillian Watson, whose Despina is a total joy, sung with a perceptive use of text, and acted with an ability to send every note and expression pinging over the footlights.Steuart Bedford conducts soberly, though he encourages the singers to add some inventive decorations to the vocal line. Taken as a whole, a slightly muted beginning to Garsington’s summer revels.

English would have been a better option.It is a varied score, with folk-derived numbers, dance scenes and grotesque, even bawdy comedy. Conductor Elgar Howarth ensures high musical standards all round.Olivia Fuchs’s staging, to clever designs by Niki Turner, gives us much of the spirit of this fantastical tale of a rural Ukraine visited by the devil and including a magic flight to the Empress’s palace in St Petersburg.The weaker parts of the production are right at the centre. Neither Anne-Sophie Duprels’ village coquette Oksana nor Adrian Dwyer’s fervent lover Vakula quite hit the vocal spot and there is little chemistry between them.But there are splendid performances from Roderick Earle as an urbane and mischievous Devil and from the irrepressible Frances McCafferty as Vakula’s mother Solokha – a widow much in demand amongst the menfolk in this particular Ukrainian village. The talented young D’Arcy Bleiker makes his mark as Potemkin in the St Petersburg scene.It is a little slow to get going but the second half is great fun, carrying the piece and the audience along to a joyous finish. Garsington shows this neglected opera to have real life in it.

Nor is compromise acceptable in the casting of the many comprimario roles which deepen and intensify the narrative.The current crop are splendid, notably Ivan Matiakh’s grizzled Nick, Charles Johnson’s compassionate Sonora, Kevin Kyle’s positively teenage Joe and Nicholas Todorovic’s professional Fargo man, Ashby. Dominic Barrand and Nicola Stonehouse bring a quiet dignity to the Indians Billy Jackrabbit and Wowkle.Director Jo Davies has clearly worked hard to achieve the bustle and camaraderie of these rough diamonds, for each cameo is lovingly drawn. Designer Will Bowen’s simple pine-wood structures simply evoke their physical world.Her direction never overplays the big moments, though Rance’s near-rape of Minnie is a knife-edge moment. However, Oli Sigurdarson’s subtle and compelling Rance sings so movingly of his deprived childhood – ‘Minnie, dalla mia casa’ – that the violence becomes understandable. His dark, centred baritone is a noble instrument.Elizabeth Blanke-Biggs, fielding an enviably secure soprano, is a heroic if insufficiently vulnerable Minnie. Despite a throat infection, Ravil Atlas’ gentleman bandit Johnson sings out strongly.John Gibbons guides the excellent City of London Sinfonia through a dramatic, deeply felt reading, though he tends to pace Act I too indulgently.

Brad Cohen is one such. His traversal of Norma is exceptional.Despite a tricky acoustic, he draws crisp yet sensitive playing from the excellent City of London Sinfonia which, from the opening bars, showed its mettle in every department. He enables the protagonists to project the ferocity and intensity of their emotions without forcing tone into ugliness, surrounds them with the distinctive Bellini sound.Nelly Miricioiu may occasionally sing under the note or smudge a run but her Norma is an imposing figure, impassioned in anger but generous of spirit. She sang ‘Casta diva’ with a wealth of irony and enviable control, revealingly filled out her relationship with Adalgisa in their ravishing yet sharply characterised duets.Diana Montague’s Adalgisa finds her at the height of her powers, tonally lustrous, technically assured, her portrait of the vulnerable priestess fleshed out with simplicity as moving as it is effective. Conal Coad is a resonant Oroveso, Don Bernardini a solid Pollione, once past his difficult opening aria. Director Mike Ashman wisely concentrates on interaction.

Escapist entertainments evolved as palliatives to the horrors of two World Wars – operettas and fantasy films (The Prisoner of Zenda) after the first, the American musical and lavish costume dramas (The Wicked Lady) after the second.The Budapest Operetta Theatre’s staging of Kalman’s Countess Maritza exemplifies such make-believe innocence while reaffirming the style, chutzpah, cracking ensemble and all-round individual skills that dignify and enhance the needful suspension of disbelief.Formulaic theses old warhorses may be, with comic supporting role, high-stepping hoofers, those in Maritza slapping thighs and clicking heels in high Hungarian fashion and a second couple as contrast to the principals.But what sheer pleasure they give, how skilfully the performers massage the melodies, light into the choreographed numbers with an inexhaustible and exhausting energy. Conductor Laszla Maklary wrings every last ounce of rubato out of Kalman’s tuneful, subtly orchestrated score, kicks into the Czardas elements with a rhythmic swagger.Yes, the sets are dated and old-fashioned, several bits decidedly tatty and there are some hilarious props – I loved the stuffed cockerel in a cage. Staging can be naively am-dram – a swaying chorus, a bare-chested youth with girlfriend popping out of a cardboard corn-stook.But the enviable verve and attack is a tonic from contemporary horrors. As Baron Zsupan and Lisa, Karoly Peller and Mara Kekkovacs sing and dance with unbuttoned exuberance, while Monika Fischl and Daniel Vadasz bring good looks, serviceable voices and bags of style to the Countess and her penniless Count Tassilo.

Spare but stylish black and white sets are dominant throughout and while this may seem to sit unhappily against the vast range of expression of the characters, there is an impression of viewing a talkie, encouraged by the thirties-style setting.With Rodelinda bleached blond and in black cocktail dress and Grimoaldo in dinner suit, the pair look like classic matinee idols in the opera’s first scene. The menacing Grimoaldo smarms about the stage with cool sophistication. Villegier bravely allows his characters to sing their arias unencumbered by fussy stage directions, emphasising Handel’s skill in conveying a wide range of emotions. But our attention is grabbed near the opening, as Emma Bell sings her second aria while deflecting Grimoaldo’s physical advances, and in the final Act, where Grimoaldo sings of his indecision on whether to kill his captive rival Bertarido. He is made to face an imaginary firing squad by his advisor Garibaldo, crystallising the latter’s advice that to let the captive live would cause Grimoaldo’s downfall.The singing is consistently impressive. Emma Bell is a gutsy Rodelinda, rich in voice but agile, and Marijana Mijanovic profits from a strong bottom register and wide range emotional range as the usurped Bertarido. Perhaps the highlight is Timothy Robinson’s Grimoaldo – generously open-voiced and effortlessly projected, presenting a powerful yet fickle dictator. Emanuelle Haim directs the period-instrument Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenement in a spirited, stylish and highly detailed account of the score.

In this she is well matched by Tom Randle with his powerfully sung Boris.Elegantly stylish, Suzanne Murphy reprises her portrayal of the domineering Kabanicha, never overplaying the harshness of such an unsympathetic character. Andrew Forbes-Lane as her pathetic son Tichon and Alan Fairs as the rich merchant Dikoy, who rather fancies her domination, give satisfying support.As the carefree lovers Varvara and Kudryash, Arlene Rolph and David Curry combine with a youthful and appealing romantic delight. Their late-night swim in the Volga is one of the more imaginative of the innovations in this staging, impressively conducted by Steven Sloane.Sung in Czech with English surtitles by Simon Rees – so essential to the understanding and appreciation of the complex plot and subtle relationships – this is a classic Janacek co-production with Grand Theatre de Geneva.

Instead, Lowery has them hanging from hooks on the wall and shot. Rossini’s vision is infinitely bigger and does not deserve to be wilfully junked.If only the individual performances could rise above the cheap gag-strewn landscape but on the whole they don’t. In the title role Deanne Meek struggles her way through the coloratura but it is clearly not her thing. Fredrik Strid’s Prince Ramiro – in superhero costume – lacks vocal resonance and the tone bulges in all sorts of odd places.Robert Poulton has some idea as stepdad Don Magnifico but has to carry an awful lot of Lowery’s misanthropic baggage. Franck Lopez, wearing a Batman costume, is given an uncomfortable ride by Dandini’s music. Wyn Pencarreg’s Alidoro and the two cruel sisters (Elena Ferrari as Clorinda, Juliette Pochin as Tisbe) are presentable and might have been more in a better show.Conductor Sergio La Stella beats time efficiently but no more.

Of these, two of the most crucial are the Male Chorus and Female Chorus, sung respectively in the second cast of this GSMD production by Jose Aparicio and Elisabeth Poirel. Raised on stone platforms either side of the stage, both singers are emotionally involved in the action – no dispassionate onlookers, these – though Aparicio’s singing loses some sophistication when quiet and high and Poirel’s vibrato tends to bulge mid-note, marring the effect of her attractive, strong voice. In the title-role, Joana Thome da Silva contrasts Lucretia’s unsullied serenity and her post-rape guilt and desperation with vocal and dramatic sureness, while John Llewelyn Evans as her assailant Tarquinius sings with suitably beefy resonance.Peter Robinson marshals his 13-piece band with precision and flair, extracting deliciously soft sleep music for Lucretia, though even with this chamber scoring the voices become occasionally masked.Dick Bird’s set is simple yet effective, based on stone fragments of Roman buildings, including carvings suspended from the ceiling. On to one of these is projected a shadow animation of a galloping horseman as Tarquinius rides to Rome to test Lucretia – a feature which carries more immediate meaning than the ten or so white, mesh-covered human sculptures, silent actor-spectators perhaps, who bridge the gap between the commentating Choruses and the more removed audience.The singing may not be consistently accomplished but this production certainly delivers the nocturnal imagery, the jealousy among Tarquinius’ circle and above all the tragedy of Lucretia’s ‘virtue assailed by sin’.

With its blend of sheer theatrical panache and a clever presentation of the work’s central battle between good and evil, this production seems set to restore Gounod’s warhorse to a prime position in the London repertory. Even if, as here, the new cast doesn’t quite match the star-studded line-up of the original.John Tomlinson’s Mephistopheles reveals the comic side of the devil well but the sinister side is far less in evidence. His voice has definitely seen better days. Elena Kelessidi is an uneven Marguerite, not quite in focus dramatically and without some of the necessary vocal sparkle. Dalibor Jenis is a good solid Valentin, with enough beefy tone to do credit to his big aria.Katija Dragojevic sings the young lad Siebel without distinction. But Della Jones gives great value in her largely comic turn as Dame Marthe and Matthew Rose is an accomplished Wagner.Where this production really does offer something vocally extraordinary is in the Faust of Polish tenor Piotr Beczala. A good actor, his tone is simply glorious and he brought the house down with ‘Salut, demeure’. A star, I think, is born.Maurizio Benini conducts an orchestra and chorus on top form and gives a broadly dramatic account of the marvellously theatrical score. But it is the tenor who steals this show.

Kuma is the madam, Nikita the local supremo of a violent criminal organisation.It works wonderfully, partly due to the imagination and consistency with which Fielding designs as well as directs but also because of a superb cast, all of whom have the vocal credentials to empower Tchaikovsky’s writing.Janis Kelly, one of the most resourceful actresses on the British operatic stage today, engages at every level with the mature, worldly-wise but vulnerable Kuma. Vassily Savenko brings authority and grandeur to the role of the moody, dissatisfied Nikita.Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts is convincing as his volatile son, whose affair with Kuma begins when he goes to tackle her about destroying his parents’ marriage. As his vengeful mother, Carole Wilson gives a performance of exceptional intensity.Add to this a borderline psychotic account of Nikita’s right-hand man Mamirov from Stephen Richardson, who doubles in this version as the poison-providing Kudma, and the evening takes on a cumulative power that explodes in the final scene.Outstanding work from the chorus, with conductor David Lloyd-Jones securing a performance of considerable style and momentum.

It is a crisp and effective staging, graced by the lavish period costumes of the late Maria Bjornson. The individual scenes offer a sequence of impressive stage pictures and the whole show is tight and involving.Above all, it shows ENO entering with confidence and some style upon classic bel canto territory. In the title role of the doomed nobleman turned bandit, Rhys Meirion finds congenial employment for his lyric tenor and is never short of power where it is needed.Cara O’Sullivan could do with a bit more weight as Elvira, especially lower down, but she is generally assured and carries of the major difficulties with some aplomb.Alastair Miles has a good track record in this repertory and certainly has enough tone but occasionally he is a little too rough in trying to extract more drama by shouting. Still, no one can doubt his engagement.The perfect blend of voice and drama comes from Ashley Holland as Don Carlo. He blends bel canto with fine diction and works wonders in his solo scene.But it is a more than presentable achievement from the entire company. Chorus and orchestra have a strong evening and conductor Mark Shanahan motivates the stirring rhythms of the piece and creates some grand musical structures in the ensembles. Verdi lovers should get themselves down to the Coliseum, where an exciting evening awaits them.

Instead we have an abstract box set and blood-red frontcloth by Christian Fenouillat, with unglamorous sweat-stained costumes by Agostino Cavalca, in stark chiaroscuro lighting by Christophe Forey.This is all in dramatic contrast to the final act which suddenly errupts into sundrenched kaleidoscopic colour, with the excitable chorus at their most up-front, rousing to bring this passionate tragedy to its shattering climax.Alluring and sexy, WNO’s first French Carmen Nora Sourouzian portrays a volatile hell-cat, thrillingly sung with chameleon changes of mood that so convincingly ensnare her would-be lovers. After an understated start Rafael Rojas as Don Jose matches her in rich-toned intensity. Daniel Sumegi is a dominating, powerfully sung presence as Escamillo with Camilla Roberts a strong but beguiling Micaela.Sung in French with English surtitles by Simon Rees, this most popular of scores receives a tremendously vivacious account by the on-form orchestra under the baton of Michal Klauza.

That is the Caurier and Leiser contemporary take on this well-loved tragedy in their sixth production for WNO.Their justification? Verdi’s groundbreaking concept had his opera set in contemporary mode but the censors forbade it. This present updating works surprisingly well, both visually and dramatically, aided by the stylish but simple settings dominated by blood red drapes, created by Christian Fenouillat. The high fashion costumes designed by Agostino Cavalca prove an eye-catching bonus in themselves.Nuccia Focile, stepping in at short notice to replace the indisposed Alexia Cousin – who was to make her British debut – is superb, receiving a tremendous reception at curtain fall. Her emotional vulnerability and convincing debility, showing through the frenetic partying, is quite moving – almost unbearably so in the final act, where she is confined to a hospital bed and tethered to a saline drip.The Alfredo of Peter Wedd is somewhat restrained, partly due to his outsider distancing from the extrovert celebrity set, while Christopher Purves as Germont gives a well-rounded and warm-hearted portrayal as his father. Strong support from Eddie Wade as Douphol and Sian Meinir as Annina.Tugan Sokhiev conducts with an assurance that brings out all the score’s passionate intensity. This opening staging of WNO’s summer tour is a co-production with Opera de Lausanne, sung in Italian with English surtitles by Simon Rees.

Or so it seems at Scottish Opera, where the peripherals – CD Rom, workshops, cartoon interpretation and all – are in danger of swamping the opera itself. Director Mark Hathaway’s ball of string, which just about sees him through, is the story. Even if the result becomes all plot and no opera. The first high-point does not come until almost the interval when dancer David Hughes creates a fine representation of the Minotaur itself, in the ritual Bull Dance.Prior to that, Paul Keohone’s robust creation of the lad Theseus as he sports with his pals, performs tests of strength and eventually finds his dad, King Aegeus (Nicholas Fowler), is all rather mundane. Mulian Evans provides music which reflects the plot and characters but he never gives the singers anything with which to use their own vocal abilities to add to the characterisation. Not until Keohone is sitting with Adele Mason’s Ariadne on Naxos, does anything like a real emotion begin to come through the voices, as opposed to the orchestration or the action.The irony is that Finlay McLay’s design provides a superb platform from which to launch this immense story. And, with the exception of a dodgy bit of flying work, the film animation is used well. But it is hard to see why the production is improved by being an opera – as opposed, for example, to a Japanese Manga cartoon.

The central spiral staircase is a permanent fixture, pertinent to the castle scenes, but obstructive in those set in the castle grounds. More confusingly still, its balustrade spontaneously bursts into flame after Melisande’s death, for no apparent reason.The elaborate floor – a bright bed of red and yellow flowers, covered by a wavy Perspex sheet – seems to offer little impression of setting. Vick’s point may be that the psychological drama unfolds irrespective of place and to some degree that is so – but the scene where Golaud spooks his half-brother in the castle vaults takes place on the sofa – a bit too cosy, really. And the enigma of the troubled Melisande crumbles somewhat at her emergence for her hair scene out of an outsized lampshade, to titters from the audience.There are some illuminating touches. Golaud first encounters Melisande not while lost in a forest but seated in the castle’s interior, as if recalling a memory. And the window through which he forces his son Yniold to spy on Pelleas and Melisande is set into the floor – pushing the boy’s face beneath the wavy Perspex delineates the harmful nature of the act.John Tomlinson is a vocally powerful Golaud, though he strains at the top of his range, while Marie Arnet as M?lisande is sweet and deft in delivering the text. But even more impressive are Russell Braun – a lyrical Pell?as, full of hope – and Christian Tr?guier, who sings his Arkel with gravity. Louis Langr?e directs a full-bodied sonority from the LPO – occasionally thin on half-lights – but magically suggesting the tangibility of the characters’ unspoken thoughts and fears.

Her fate, as always with updating, is unconvincing. Why is she not whisked off to hospital?A sterling group of young singers make it all work. Rachel Hynes’ clear-eyed Mimi deploys a vibrant soprano. Rebecca von Lipinski’s stylish Musetta is a seasoned survivor, Roland Wood a laid-back Schaunard. Roderick Williams’ rich, centred baritone sings crisply off words to create a volatile Marcello with an obvious future. Peter Auty’s likeable if self-absorbed Rodolfo deploys a warm, bonny tenor with bags of sensitivity. Here are two of the brightest British singers around.Richard Farnes conducts an affectionate reading which tends to milk detail at the expense of momentum.

Erich Wonder’s single set presents the atrium of a modern hotel complete with padded seating, staircases and escalators, which director Peter Mussbach uses with resource.Some will miss the traditional waltzing couples of the second-act ball scene but Mussbach has done a detailed job of transferring the main characters and their swiftly-changing relationships to this new setting and the result is one of the best acted productions seen at Covent Garden this season.It is also superbly sung, with each of the three star principals giving a performance it would be impossible to better today.Karita Mattila looks and sounds a million dollars as the young woman who turns away from her many admirers when Mr Right turns up. He is the Croatian landowner Mandryka, sung by Thomas Hampson, whose subtle use of a great baritone voice makes him a convincing and deeply engaged partner.No less moving is Barbara Bonney as Arabella’s put-upon sister Zdenka, who duets flawlessly with Mattila and shares with her the tremendous emotional release of the final act. Smaller roles are faultlessly delivered, especially Raymond Very’s gloomy, desperate Matteo and Diana Damrau’s pinpoint-accurate Fiakermilli.Assuring the highest musical standards is Strauss expert Christoph von Dohnanyi in the pit. The orchestra has never sounded better. With the whole company on tip-top form, this is unquestionably one of Covent Garden’s great evenings.

Certain aspects, indeed, have improved of late.The chorus has a lively evening, singing energetically and taking part in the busier sequences with panache. The kids’ chorus in the first act bounces along happily. The fights go well.Conductor David Atherton keeps the score moving and the playing has plenty of precision, if not quite enough spirit.But where the show starts to look and sound fuzzy is in some of the crucial central performances. Alison Roddy is a pallid Micaela, singing the part anonymously and scarcely setting up Carmen with a credible rival. In the title role Sara Fulgoni sings conscientiously and with appropriate vocal resources but she is a fatally tame and all too well-behaved gypsy girl.John Hudson manages Don Jose’s vocalism more than efficiently but he is stodgy on stage until the final scene, when he at last engages with the character physically and shows some dramatic initiative. If he could manage that throughout the evening, he would be marvellous.Best value from most perspectives comes from Peter Coleman-Wright’s Escamillo. He understands how to make an impact and brings his honed skills in singing, diction and stagecraft together in a performance that injects some charisma into the proceedings.Graeme Danby attacks Zuniga with vigour but generally this is a Carmen that needs less British reserve and a good deal more Spanish passion.

But Lampe was a talented composer in his own right and his catchy rhythms and varied arias are clever as well as witty.With its brilliant design, by Tatiana Tulubieva and Igor Nezhny, evoking an British landscape garden, and sensational costumes for the opera singers – including Mikhail Davydov’ amiable Lion – the show starts with upper class gentleman Ilya Ilyin and his lady wife Leonid Varichenko (in drag) showing off their musical snobbery as they take tea following a game of croquet.Thereafter comes the opera proper, whose musical darts are as well aimed as those of Benjamin Britten in his later setting. The fact that all the performers speak and sing with a heavy Russian accent makes it twice as funny.It is a crisp production of a sharp little piece that should be better known in its home country. Julian Gallant conducts a small but perfectly formed ensemble.

A pity the Rachmaninov libretto, based on Dante’s Paolo and Francesca episode, is so undramatic as to render the piece a tone poem with vocal interjections.Still, David Pountney creates a genuine hell onstage. Frightened and restless immigrants clutching suitcases seethe and shuffle in and around Johan Engels’ vast meshed cage, sickeningly suggestive of prison, detention centre or ship’s hold, their circle of anxiety and pain an endless torture.The lovers and their nemesis, Francisca’s husband Malatesta – the magnificent Jonathan Summers in thrilling voice – inexplicably play out their tragedy amidst them. Nina Pavlovski’s Francesca shapes her music lovingly but Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts’ impassioned Paolo is vocally rough.Conductor Martin Andre whips up a storm, cherishes the ravishing moments of the love scene, the orchestra relishing every nervy, sensuous and tempestuous second of the subtly orchestrated score.The Leoncavallo is less lucky. David Parry bashes through the piece, while Christopher Alden comes up with an outrageous conceit which reverses events. In the first half Canio and the Clowns perform a rock opera in a seedy venue, after which the group fatally falls out in a cafe adjoining a cinema.Were there any correspondence between music and metaphor, it might just work. A splendid cast give it their all, notably Summers as Prologue and a drumming Tonio, Mark Stone as Silvio, chef and groupie clutching the albums. The incomparable Majella Cullagh’s Nedda is a slut with style and a gleaming soprano.

A mezzanine for the barber’s shop allows the chair to dispatch its victims at speed down an almost vertical chute, and a set of iron railings at the same upper level creates a dramatic cage for the imprisoned Johanna (Beverley Worboys).These are such deliciously comic lyrics, especially on the lips and with the impeccable timing of Jenny Galloway as the round and pragmatic Mrs Lovett. She is all the more outrageous for the mild and sometimes even deadpan way in which she delivers her lines. “Think of it as thrift. It’s a gift. You get my drift?” she urges when suggesting Sweeney Todd uses his victims as pie filling.There is so much detail to observe, so many chilling cameos of the Victorian streets going on alongside the main action. The lunatics in Bedlam are fearful and the clients of the pie shop jolly. Hard on the heels of scenes of whipping and flagellation comes an interlude with the soon to be dispatched Beadle playing merry songs at the harmonium. The attention does not stray for a moment.Lyndon Terracini is fearsome as Sweeney, his rich bass voice seeming to come out of the depths of hell.

Robert Hayward has the voice of a Wotan, which is a significant plus, but his diction is poor and he shows little sign of understanding the complexity of the role. This creates a big hole at the centre.Kathleen Broderick’s Brunnhilde has energy and determination but is vocally limited. An occasional resemblance to Julie Walters as Mrs Overall severely undercuts the warrior maiden image.Orla Boylan is an adequate Sieglinde but only intermittently an involving one. Par Lindskog’s Siegmund sings flat or with uningratiating tone and sometime both at once.Clive Bayley is a strong Hunding but Susan Parry’s Fricka is a discomforting listen.However, the orchestra has gained in confidence and provides notable playing under Paul Daniel, even if he fails to motivate much of the score.Phyllida Lloyd’s staging, designed by Richard Hudson, has some impressive moments but unfortunately they are separated by long stretches where the dramatic connection between the singers is tenuous. Vast tracts of the second act, with its crucial dialogues, are as flat as your hat.On to Siegfried in November.

David Pountney’s staging imbues the latter with a brooding power to match the score’s impassioned depiction of disenfranchisement and loss played out in, on and around designer Johan Engel’s huge, tilted container, expressively lit by Adam Silverman.Nina Pavloski and Leonardo Capalbo bring vocal heft to the troubled, restless Giorgetta and Luigi, her volatile lover. Jonathan Summer’s vocally powerful Michele is a dangerous, unsettling presence. Anne Marie Owens finds the pain underlying La Frugola’s paean to her cat.Martin Andr? conducts a searing reading of Puccini’s richly orchestrated score, which subtly interweaves seething passion and expressive local colour. The orchestra play as if possessed.However, Christopher Alden, having removed most of the recit from Rossini’s ‘burletta’, updates and refashions the libretto into a post-modernist farce, setting it amidst such exasperating hazards of travel as crashes, carousels, suitcases, turbulence, disorientation, cabin attendants and quixotic fellow passengers. Naughty, but Rossini?Majella Cullagh, Mark Stone, Iain Paton, Adrian Clarke, Kim-Marie Woodhouse and Nicholas Sharratt give it their best shot, cope heroically and hilariously with hair-rising costume changes, crisply deliver Amanda Holden’s witty translation and traverse Rossini’s musical challenges with accuracy, full tone and nary a bum note.

It is not wearing well. Despite the grandeur of Dante Ferretti’s Risorgimento settings, what happens within them is often pretty vague in the hands of some singers with limited acting talent.In the case of Marco Berti’s Manrico, this is practically non-existent, though he is able to point himself in the right direction most of the time. It is a shame, because his healthy and hefty tenor voice is well suited to the role. But he badly needs to go on an acting course.Lado Ataneli’s Count of Luna is a bit livelier but his singing is without nuance and has some rough edges.As for Italian soprano Fiorenza Cedolins, who seems to have only the vaguest notion of who Leonora is and what situations she finds herself in, her dramatic sketchiness is not outweighed by enough good singing. She doesn’t seem to understand that Verdi’s music needs careful and conscientious shaping. She is simply dull.Armenian bass Arutjun Kotchinian gets the evening off to a mediocre start with an indifferent narration by Ferrando. There is some vigour to his singing but not enough definition or solidity.Only Russian mezzo Irina Mishura comes near her role with an Azucena sung with lustrous tone and acted with intelligence.At least there is some strong work from the chorus and orchestra and above all a reading of classical restraint and dignity from conductor Sir Edward Downes.

With strong orchestral support under versatile conductor Roy Laughlin and the experienced John Copley staging scenes from eight operas ranging from Baroque to modern, the standards attained are impressive indeed.All 12 of the featured singers deserve to find work with our companies but only time will tell what level they will rise to.Handel proves the toughest nut to crack, with some uncertain vocal values in a sequence of arias from Alcina but Lorina Gore and Cora Burggraaf make a beguiling highlight of a duet from Mozart’s ‘Il re pastore’.The Donizetti extract from Anna Bolena features Lee Bisset and Lise Christensen, who make a creditable attempt at the difficult Anna/Giovanna scene and bring it off dramatically. Robert Murray engages well as Jack in The Midsummer Marriage and particularly as a mellifluous Des Grieux in Manon.His partner in the latter is Kate Royal, already a lyric soprano of rich timbre and dramatic command. Equalling her in maturity is Paul Carey Jones, a Welsh baritone of striking vocal achievement and an effective stage performer. Another hugely gifted artist is New Zealander Andrew Sritheran, whose bright, shiny tenor has Heldentenor potential.

His period of appalling misrule is brought to an end by a Russian invasion, after which Ma and Pa Ubu look for fresh fields to conquer across the Atlantic.Visually, Krzysztof Warlikowski’s production is a riot, with athletes, drum majorettes, video screens, an off-stage brass band and front-of-house interventions incorporated into the no holds barred staging.Pawel Wunder is the greasy, ghastly Ubu and delivers a frontal assault on the audience’s sensibilities. He is marvellous, as is Anna Lubanska in full coloratura flight as his wife and political partner. Indeed there is strong casting throughout, with memorable participation from Mieczyslaw Milun as the Tsar and his transsexual Tsarina Rafal Siwek, as well as Aleksander Teliga and Izabella Klosinska as King Wenceslas and his consort Queen Rosamund, whom Ubu assassinates.It is easy to see that for Penderecki and his director this story resonates with particular sharpness. Some of that feeling finds its way into the punchy, parody-laden score, which is vividly delivered by Jacek Kaspszyk and his choral and orchestral forces in what proves to be the most memorable of the Polish Opera’s shows.

It is admittedly an artificial frame and John Lloyd Davies’ production does not successfully articulate what is naturalistic and what is stylised in the drama. Too much of the action appears stilted, with even such an astute stage performer as Grant Doyle’s Tarquinius occasionally at a loss.But Lloyd Davies’ own set, which brings Roman statuary on stage with some books hanging mysteriously from the ceiling, uses the space inventively and to grand purpose. He lights it cleverly.Doyle’s incisive singing and fine use of text provide the best single element and things become a little dull when he is disappeared after his crime. Christine Rice sings Lucretia vividly, with ample tone, but there’s a lack of tragic grandeur as she approaches her end.Hubert Francis’ Male Chorus needs more vocal nuance and it is unclear who he and Victoria Nava’s Female Chorus, dressed in forties artire and armed with books and a typewriter, are supposed to be. Integrating them into the action has not worked on this occasion.Alexander Briger conducts a hand-picked ensemble of ROH players who make the score sound marvellous. His high-definition approach and keen sense of flow produce excellent results.

And it is a more full and effective production for it, both musically and theatrically. Giving the young cast – joined by Blake Fischer as Lensky – extra scope to display their acting skills and flaunt their vocal abilities in the smaller venues of Scotland.While the new arrangement allows the tunes to thrum through the orchestration, it also makes the musical construction of the opera all the more simple to understand. Not that the soloists of the Orchestra of Scottish Opera under conductor Derek Clark have an easy time, as balance becomes an even more crucial factor to the success of the piece.The small scale also enhances the theatricality of what is not, on the surface, a highly theatrical opera. It allows emotions to come right to the fore. No more so than in the letter writing scene where Rachel Nicholls’ Tatyana is seriously hot for Onegin. Although, in John La Boudhardiere’s only directorial misjudgement, the baring of her breasts to Onegin’s image is neither blatant nor subtle enough to appear anything apart from contrived.Emma Donovan’s bookish set and design continually emphasises the ideas of image and reflection. Huge moving windows dominate the set to frame or reflect the action. Although they sadly also reflect the TV monitor of the conductor. A minor but avoidable annoyance in what is a supreme evening of operatic entertainment.

Almost three hours of unrelieved gloom makes for a depressing evening. Both operas are fairly static, especially the de Falla, but Christopher Alden’s extraordinary staging grips like a vice. Set in designer Johann Engels’ evocative run-down sweatshop where women toil over wedding dresses while men lounge idly, the tragedy of Salud’s betrayal unfolds like the inner thoughts of those involved.Martin Andre conducts a red-blooded reading which intensifies the onstage drama, the inimitable Opera North chorus creating a sickeningly believable social order hostile to those who flout convention, like Richard Coxon’s defiant transvestite ‘seamstress’.Mary Plazas sings Salud’s impassioned music with gleaming tone, acts with a contained desperation. Leonardo Capalbo is a full-voiced Paco of sullen good looks. Susan Gorton’s rich contralto dignifies Salud’s sympathetic grandmother. This extraordinary staging deserves more than one visit.Sadly, David Pountney’s perverse production of The Dwarf, with its funny walks, continual grimacing and hideous plastic costumes destroys it. Only Paul Nilon’s finely sung Dwarf and Majella Callugh’s caring Ghita survive the banal posturings.

Premiered two years after the horrific Warsaw insurrection of 1863, its pointed if unemphatic subtext caused the Russian censor to ban it after a mere three performances.Two patriotic brothers, Stefan and Zbigniew, return from the wars to cultivate their father’s estate, while resisting their aunt’s determination to marry them off. Before they visit the Sword-Bearer’s estate, she convinces them his manor is haunted. His daughters Hanna and Jadwiga oblige with ghostly shenanigans but eventually corral the brothers.The score flies along, especially as conducted by Jacek Kaspszyk, who had the orchestra playing with bags of dash and sensitivity, the woodwind especially mellifluous. And the large chorus sang their socks off but their rhubarb style acting exemplified Mikolaj Grabowski’s old-style direction.An attempt to deconstruct the piece, with a painter stage-front working on canvases, doesn’t work. And some of the acting is of the emotional semaphore variety, notably that of the rather wooden, vocally precarious Stefan.However, Iwona Hossa’s mettlesome Hanna is a delight, her gleaming soprano fully in command of the notes, while Anna Lubanska’s cosy Jadwiga fields a warm mezzo. Baritone Adam Kruszewski is a noble Sword-Bearer, Romuald Tesarowicz a servant with an impressive beetle-black bass.When the dancers flung themselves into the final Mazurka, they set the seal on a triumph of dedicated ensemble work. Magic.

Dame Felicity Lott approaches the Marschallin circumspectly these days, though her tone remains much as it was. But it is a portrayal short on warmth and sophistication and remains resolutely English and middle class rather than Viennese and aristocratic.Angelika Kirchschlager’s Octavian does some pleasant things dramatically, particularly in the lighter moments of the first act, but vocally this is a small-scale performance, lacking colour and variety.German soprano Simone Nold makes her Royal Opera debut as Sophie. Here again there is a shortage of charm and nuance and the result is frankly dull. The final trio and duet – two of the greatest highlights in all opera – sound distinctly less than magical on this occasion.Partly this is a result of Sir Charles Mackerras’s conducting, which is never less than efficient but rarely much more than that. The strings play without that sheeny quality Strauss’s score demands.By far the best thing in the show is Kurt Rydl’s Baron Ochs, which is played to the hilt and sung with a grand variety of tone. Eike Wilm Schulte is an uncharacteristically tentative Faninal.Strauss’s bittersweet comedy needs the most precise definition in every aspect of its staging to make its proper impact. This time around there is far too much fuzziness and not merely at the edges.

From the skittering scales of the overture on, conductor Paul McGrath holds the audience’s attention with a finely achieved and stylish musical performance.Gideon Davey’s sets provide an apt background against which the company can execute their precisely articulated manoeuvres. Matthew Richardson’s production, graced by Emma Ryott’s flawless period costumes and magically lit by Giuseppe di Iorio, does not put a foot wrong in leading us through the whirlwind of events in the Almaviva household. The famous sextet, in particular, is so cleverly staged that it gets a round of applause.The cast is excellent. Darren Jeffery has done nothing better on the London stage than this bonhomous, sonorous Figaro and Tamsin Coombs finds exactly the right blend of delicacy and wit as Susanna. Her last-act serenade is a highlight.Leading off for the gentry are Damian Thantrey’s dangerous, insecure Count – a riveting performance – and Andrea Creighton’s soulful Countess. Richard Van Allan’s Bartolo displays masterly stagecraft and Pippa Longworth’s Marcellina is full of character.Finely attuned too is Doreen Curran’s agile, mellifluous Cherubino, while Joseph Shovelton offers far more than the usual caricature as Basilio and Mark Saberton’s horny-handed Antonio is positively scene-stealing.The whole show, musically and dramatically, is as bright and as sharp as a new pin and Jeremy Sams’ translation sparkles.

However, the set’s geography is so peculiar as to confuse narrative.There are several questions raised. What is Bartolo’s status? How can he afford a music teacher, a housekeeper and a house-visiting barber? The staging establishes no meaningful social order, so it is difficult to know. And do we assume Almaviva is a Count because he flashes money around? Would Bartolo have a ward such as Rosina in the fifties?But forget this critic’s desire for logic, for ideas to spring from words and music, for wanting to experience Rossini’s corrosive take on love, lust, money, class, deception, honesty. That is elitist. Having fun is all.The press night audience laughed itself silly over irrelevant visual gags involving a stuffed cat (overdone), bizarre objects removed from a steaming oven (also overdone), a knife throwing act for Bartolo, an apron-toting police chief, and a good deal more.As for characterisation, Geoffrey Dolton’s Bartolo has clearly overdone the uppers, Owen Gilhooly’s Barney Flintstone Figaro is merely loud vocally anddramatically. The shallow-toned Rosina acts pert but comes across mousy. Only Darren Abrahams truly suceeds as the likeable Almaviva, singing with style and confidence. Brad Cohen’s conducting is brisk and the ensemble often ragged.

As the Merry Widow of the title, Jan Hartley looks like a million dollars, is in fact worth 20 million and has a voice that money cannot buy. She is the Queen Bee and attracts fortune hunters like honey. All, that is, except the strong romantic lead, Karl Daymond, who looks like a young Mario Lanza and whether rejecting or falling for her makes a powerful impact vocally. While Victor Spinetti is a delight cornering the pompous comedy as the cuckolded baron and ambassador.Despite the fact that the Carl Rosa operates three touring companies without sponsorship or public funding – cries of shame – this present company has 66 members and musicians and a stage cast of 29 singers. Among them are David Curry as Camille, Deborah Myers as the baron’s philandering wife and Garth Bardsley.The show is superbly dressed in start of the century fashions and judging by how tuneful so many of the familiar songs remain, there is no reason why this particular widow should not continue weaving her spell for the next century.

It’s a wonderful, joyous show, giving full value to Gilbert’s theatre of the absurd text and Sullivan’s precise and elegant music.The dialogue is delivered more emphatically and snappily than last time round, though the affected cut glass vowels are still one satiric step too far. It would be funnier without them. Furthermore, the tap-dancing hotel staff in the Act I finale are still wildly off-beat.But the rest is top-drawer. Richard Suart remains the classic Ko-Ko of our time, even if there was just a hint of going over the top in this performance. It is important to know when to put the brakes on.Frances McCafferty is a great Katisha, sublime in the comedy, dignified in the touching music Sullivan gave her to counter Gilbert’s unrelenting mockery.Jeni Bern is the attractive Yum-Yum, Bonaventura Bottone a little long in the vocal tooth for Nanki-Poo but very much present and correct.

But his grasp of theatrical pacing was not yet sure and the textures thick and heavy for too much of its lengthy span. Still, there is some fine music here, even if the reasons for the piece’s neglect are obvious.UCO usually come up with a strong production that looks more expensive than it is but here Madeleine Boyd’s designs are frowsy and Matthias Janser’s direction tepid and at times obscure.The work is wisely sung in English, though Susan Reynolds’s translation doesn’t always hit the right style or sit well with the notes.Conductor Charles Peebles delivers a largely secure orchestral performance and the chorus is very much present and correct. Elaine McKrill shows her mettle in the arduous title role and Bradley Daley is resilient as her lover, Slavoj.Paul Keohone delivers a trenchant account of the invading German Prince Roderich and James Gower’s High Priest shows off a fine bass voice and an impressive presence.

As long as Lully held a monopoly over public operatic performance in France under the reign of Louis XIV, the talented Charpentier stood little chance of competing. Only after Lully’s death could he really show what he could do.But he was able to provide operas for private institutions and it was for France’s most prestigious school, the Jesuit College Louis Le Grand, that he wrote this biblical piece in 1688. It explores the triangular relationship between David, Saul and his son Jonathan in music of unusual power, imagination and expressivity. Among the most gripping scenes is the prologue, in which Saul causes the Witch of Endor to raise the ghost of Samuel.But there are lighter incidents too, with delightfully appealing dance movements surrounding scenes of David’s victory. Conductor Emmanuelle Haim brings verve and relish to her work with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment and a handpicked team of soloists finds the musical style and dramatic insight needed to do justice to their roles. Laurent Naouri conveys a vivid depiction of the doomed and guilty Saul, with Paul Agnew presenting a David that comes alive before our eyes. Jael Azzaretti’s small soprano fits neatly the role of the youth Jonathan.Most of all the performance demonstrates the qualities of this unusual piece, which certainly deserves a full-scale staging in the UK – and soon.

Yet Richard Jones’ bleaker, less overtly Expressionist vision is equally unsettling, its heightened realism laced with a dark, vicious humour which excoriates the social structure that destroys Katarina.Designer John Macfarlane provides a series of fifties utility-style adjoining rooms, which Mimi Jordan Sherin’s lighting renders by turns garish and shabby, retreats within which sleazy and unspeakable activities seek consummation away from prying eyes. The final Act’s lorries disgorging their convict victims is truly harrowing.Jones’ control of narrative is masterly, the many crucial exchanges directed with a trenchant minimalism that allows the score’s full-blooded, super-charged expressivity to register without seeming tautologous.The ROH orchestra realises Antonio Pappano’s corrosive reading with blazing conviction, finding both the power and the tenderness of this extraordinary score. The chorus sing with precision and people the Ismailov estate with a mean relish. Stage and pit move in perfect accord.And what a cast. Has Katarina ever been better sung? Katarina Dalayman’s gleaming, burnished soprano so colours the text as movingly to reconcile Katarina’s innate humanity with her extreme solutions to misfortune. Here is characterisation of genius.As her husband Zinovy, Stefan Margita’s laser-bright tenor makes impotence insidiously vicious. John Tomlinson’ lecherous, gun-toting Boris is chilling. Christopher Ventris’ strongly sung, bullish Sergey is an unappetising amalgam of bluster and duplicity. Peter Bronder fashions a gem of a Shabby Peasant.No-one should miss this exhilarating staging of a 20th-century operatic landmark.

Haliate’s daughter Elmira, her lover Sosarme, Queen Erenice and the honourable Melo successfully broker reconciliation, despite painful setbacks.Handel’s richly orchestrated score brings intensity and depth to the major themes of love, loyalty, honour, integrity and good governance. The music is by turns rousing, tender, aggressive and thoughtful, so meticulously paced as to enhance excitingly the dramatic ebb and flow.Laurence Cummings conducted the superb period band in a reading which revealed the work’s multifaceted riches, the tempos expertly integrated and judged to keep the narrative on the move. He was always supportive of the singers.A talented young cast sang with an enviable surety and style. Jennifer Johnston’s full, confident mezzo brought a moving authority to Erenice’s music. Essi Luttinen and Elizabeth Watts were the sparky, pure-toned lovers, whose delivery of ‘Per le porte del tormento’ was ravishingly beautiful. Tim Mead’s put-upon Melo fielded a warm countertenor. Nicholas Watts’ Haliate improved after a blustery start.Relton’s camp, sub-Wildean staging presented them as members of a dysfunctional Edwardian family. Worst of legion horrors were a teacup routine imposed upon Sosarme’s splendid Act II aria with horns and an irrelevant happy families flashback, which upstaged Melo’s touching Act III aria.

Some cuts might not be amiss.The original is in Venetian dialect and though this production is sensibly sung in English, Edward Dent’s 1946 translation has grown whiskers and needs replacing.Nicholas Braithwaite conducts with a light touch but the piece needs more pace in places.Simple, straightforward period designs by Vicki Cowan provide the frame for John Ramster’s production, which unfortunately takes Wolf-Ferrari’s elegant and gentle wit down a notch or three. There is far too much pulling of funny faces, caricaturing instead of characterising and vulgarising the original. It’s all too close to Carry On Up the Grand Canal.Not many in the cast realise their full potential hidden behind all this clumsy hyperactivity – the men suffer in particular. But there is an attractive tenor on display from Charne Rochford as Filipeto, while Louise Sjostedt’s Marina and Helena Dix’s Felice – who has flawless diction – both show well produced voices and highly developed stage skills.

Happily Nicholas Hytner’s delightful staging of Mozart’s Flute, revived by Ian Rutherford, comes up fresh as ever, the hieratic and hierarchical elements finely balanced, the comedy unforced, the deeper emotions tapped without a trace of sentimentality.The flexible setting unfussily evokes the realms of both darkness and light, while Rutherford never compromises Hytner’s discreet way with such tricky moments as the animals and Papageno’s bells pacifying Monostatos and his lackeys. The trials of fire and water still convince.There is, too, the added pleasure of experiencing some delightful young performers, even if some do push their voices into ugliness. Toby Spence’s urgent Tamino would be even more impressive if he occasionally sang below forte, when his tenor acquires a pleasingly golden tone. And Toby Stafford-Allen’s Papageno, sporting a rather roving Mummerset accent, sacrifices tonal centredness to expressivity. Both should try singing in a more relaxed way.However, Carolyn Sampson’s impassioned Pamina gives almost unalloyed pleasure, her vibrant, centred  soprano singing off words with an innate feel for the Mozartian line. Despite a brisk tempo, she makes ‘Ach, ich fuhls’ a moment of affecting anguish.Brindley Sherratt brings nobility and authority to Sarastro and a firm, dark tone to both his arias – pity the Queen of the Night is such feeble opposition. Sarah-Jane Davies, Victoria Simmonds and Yvonne Howard are exemplary as the witty yet dangerous Three Ladies. Conductor Nicholas Kraemerı’s lightweight reading robs this Flute of gravitas.

And she is further aided by a cast that taps into these bittersweet sentiments with both confidence and competence.Some things, however, do jar – the setting is modern and vaguely suggestive of youth culture. Ben Kerslake’s Rudolfo in particular, with his reversed baseball cap and baggy pants, is almost certain to remind you of someone you don’t like and demands of the audience a greater leap of suspended disbelief. Close your eyes to it and the production carries you on tolerably well, particularly Lisa Carlioth’s Mimi – a Nordic figure of undoubted authority and great stage presence, though, if anything, a little too sturdy for an ebbing spirit. Her relationship with Rudolfo carries no huge conviction, possibly due to his resemblance to Harry Enfield’s Kevin.Heather Hunter’s hip swinging Musetta is at once blowsy and seductive while Peter Snipp as Marcello conveys a swaggering Jack-the-Lad confidence.

Anyone experiencing the work for the first time can savour its sublimities without intrusive directorial glosses.If the action seems at times to hang fire, that is to overlook the freedom given to the singers to integrate meaningfully words and music. They create characters that are neither ciphers nor constructs but living, fallible beings. The production makes one hang on every word, on every vocal phrase to fathom motives and emotions.Designer Joanna Parker’s unfussy period costumes work well within elegant yet flexible settings, created with trucked wooden frames incorporating louvered doors. She has forged style out of economy, another rare virtue. Here is an aristocratic home within whose walls Miller presents a fine-tuned social hierarchy.An impressive cast seize their every opportunity to play out this masterly comedy of manners, fraught with emotional and class tensions barely held in check. Julie Unwin’s embattled yet noble Countess, singing with gleaming tone, is an impersonation rich in nuances. A pity her Count lacks the looks of a philanderer.Rodney Clarke, a strikingly handsome Figaro, and Donna Bateman as his feisty Susanna, both sing crisply off words with an innate musicality. They define status with enviable precision.

Argentinian Jose Cura, arguably the most gifted spinto tenor of his generation, has some wonderful moments but a tendency to allow his voice practically to disappear for effects that don’t quite come off. He is sturdy and handsome as the Israelite champion but at times a touch disengaged.American mezzo Denyce Graves has a grand instrument that can flesh out Delilah’s music superbly but again there is an impression that her concentration is patchy. One or two moments are sketchy and dramatically she paints with a broad brush.Bruno Caproni’s High Priest matches the central duo with plenty of voice but a lack of definition in his performance as a whole. There is a superb Abimelech from Armenian bass Tigran Martirossian – what a shame he gets killed off so early – and an outstanding Old Hebrew from Romanian bass Julian Rodescu.The chorus has another excellent evening – they are on unbeatable form these days – and the orchestra plays well for Philippe Jordan, though he does not quite provide sufficient subtlety and finesse to ensure the piece registers as first-class.

The second was no less exciting, that superb singing actor Alexandru Agache returning in the title role, Tamar Iveri again the feisty Amelia. Both sing off words with warm, focused tone and characterise with a subtle economy that never lapses into ham.New to the cast was the young Bulgarian bass Orlin Anastassov. He looks too young as the patrician Fiesco but his dark, centred bass, more Russian than Italian in sound, does full justice to words and phrases with a firm line.However, perhaps the evening’s most exciting discovery was Nicola Rossi Giordano, a handsome six-footer blessed with the kind of good looks and weighty tenor which immediately grab attention. He is no mere belter but phrases with a natural musicality, is sensitive to text and observant of dynamics. However, he needs to pace himself more securely, he sometimes tends to run out of steam. Nor would a touch more honey to the tone in alt come amiss. His acting is more enthusiastic than controlled. But what promise.That experienced Verdian Mark Elder shaped a dramatic reading with the ROH orchestra on cracking form. A most rewarding evening.

What this production has is a well-matched and vocally impressive leading couple. Anya Szreter, singing Violetta, revels in her rich yet easy-going top end. The role may not call for the greatest agility but there is plenty of high writing, in which Szreter showed an adaptable top end, capable of power and delicacy.Her Alfredo, Dominic Natoli, is a fine tenor, bright and lyrical, who colours his voice beautifully and wrings full meaning from the words, here sung in English. He achieves this both within individual phrases and between extremes of emotion, such as his rapt declaration of love in the Act I duet, and – after he believes he has been spurned by Violetta – his furious settlement of financial debt to her, which he sees as clearing his honour.Sadly, Chris Parke – Alfredo’s father Giorgio – though attractive vocally, held little presence onstage, which noticeably lengthened his long scene with Violetta.Rob Kealey’s staging is straightforward but effective, despite the couple’s country house seeming too sparely furnished to give the impression of living beyond their means. And the orchestra of well-rehearsed young players, under Simon Toyne, may have lacked a little punch in places but they were directed with sensitivity and style, capable of reflecting the emotion on stage.

The latest revival is fresh, fast and extremely funny, though the darker side loses out somewhat.Russell Craig’s travelling theatre setting of steps leading to several levels works well. But is it, perhaps, a touch too elaborate? The performance style is Commedia dell-arte, costumes period, some conventions 18th century – with spectators sitting onstage and applauding set-pieces and the singers breaking role in acknowledgement. The effect is feel-good, though pretty unsavoury folk people this tale of pimping, deception and, let’s face it, lust.Richard Angas’ Basilio is the exception, his dark bass, as pitch black as his venality, shaping the music with slanderous relish. Nicholas Sales’ Almaviva is also a triumph. Not for an age has a British tenor combined such tonal sweetness and heft. He cleanly executes unaspirated runs, phrases with expressivity and can refine down the voice to a captivating pianissimo. His Count, an impetuous booby, is the perfect precursor to Mozart’s sexual predator.The remaining cast serve the piece well. Garry Magee is a handsome, infectious Figaro. Eric Roberts demonstrates yet again his mastery of comic timing – his Bartolo is hilarious because subtly underplayed – while Carole Wilson’s formidable Berta confidently rides the ledger lines of the Act I finale. However, Deanne Meek’s well-acted Rosina is vocally under-powered.Wyn Davies conducts a witty and ebullient reading, whose cleverly judged tempos, steadier than usual, allow words to come across crystal clear. Don’t miss this revival.

The lesser roles are again superbly realised, notably Sarah Pring’s predatory Flora permanently poised for the kill.Arden’s equally telling insights into the actions of the central trio ensure their exchanges glow with a fierce inner core. Anne-Sophie Duprel’s febrile yet tigerish Violetta stage manages her Act I gathering hyped to the emotional gills, collapsing exhausted at the close of ‘Sempre libera’.Thereafter, she subtly reveals the courtesan’s innate goodness in her scenes with Alfredo and Robert Poulton’s sharply characterised elder Germont, a persuasive monster who himself almost falls prey to the charismatic Violetta. Throughout, the technically assured Duprel sings off words with gleaming, vibrant tone.Peter Auty, the new Alfredo, is a young British tenor wholly devoid of the blanched, bleating tone so admired in indigenous tenors. His warm, centred singing catches Alfredo’s naivety and fervour while having plenty of heft for Act II, as first he rages against then humiliates Violetta. Why is he not singing more leading roles?Richard Farnes conducts a white-hot reading which builds the score’s architecture upon spot-on tempos, notably throughout Flora’s bash, and has a fine ear for orchestral detail. The orchestra respond like thoroughbreds. A great evening.

Some of Britain’s finest singers, who knew, worked with, admired and loved her, ensured it was an uplifting occasion, a gleaming setting for her life and career.The evening might have been one laden with a sense of loss. Instead, after a somewhat serious start, there followed a Victorian ballad, show tunes, songs, arias and ensembles both dramatic and witty, which combined fun and seriousness to reflect Chilcott’s energy and sense of fun, her love of life and dedication to her art.A packed house, which spoke volumes for the esteem in which she was held, enthusiastically applauded item after item. Highlights for me were Anthony Michaels-Moore’s touching delivery of Yeletsky’s aria from Queen of Spades, Joan Rodgers, Susan Bickley and Andrew Shore intently shaping Mozart’s ravishing ‘Soave sia il vento’ and Simon Keenlyside’s heart-rending portrayal of Billy in the Darbies (Billy Budd).On a more intimate level, Janis Kelly, Linda Kitchen and Wyn Davies fast-forwarded Mozart’s Figaro with side-splitting results, while Rossini’s Cat Duet found Susan Bullock and Anne-Marie Owens straying hilariously into alien territory.Karl Daymond rivalled Coward in a pointedly re-written version of I’ve Been to a Marvellous Party. Frances McCafferty delivered Cole Porter’s I Hate Men with seething venom. In sum, an inspiring and worthy celebration.

Since both of his earlier comedies featuring Figaro – The Barber of Seville and The Marriage of Figaro – have produced world-famous operas, this one seems a mine of possibilities.And so it proves. Holden’s contemporary version, played out amongst the Fitzroy family, whose murky past is investigated in Bill Bankes-Jones’ vivid production to witty designs by Tim Meacock, provides a taut and well made canvas for the composers to work on.Each tackles a handful of scenes, and though styles inevitably vary the whole adds up to a vastly entertaining evening. None lets the side down, though the initial scenes of Act 2, set by James Olsen, Mike Henry and John Webb, display the surest touch.Such certainty is perfectly matched by the four-piece orchestra under the firm direction of Stuart Stratford and by a marvellous cast, led by the older generation of Adey Grummet’s Rosa and Omar Ebrahim’s Mr Fitzroy, whose extramarital interludes are sorted out by the younger generation of Sarah Jillian Cox’s Flora and Darren Abrahams’ Leo. Burgess, played by Robert Burt, provides the villainy while Aris Nadiran’s Figaro is the paste that holds the piece together. They are all excellent and this valuable exercise in offering composers operatic experience produces a top-notch show.

It is a touring-friendly opera, with each of its acts requiring only one setting – just as well, given that the Moldovan company will be taking it to 41 UK venues between now and June.This is venue number four and the singers currently appear to have full reserves of energy. None more so than Georgian tenor Teimuraz Gugushvili, whose Cavaradossi is marked by a strong, true tenor voice with impressive power and stamina. His acting may not be up to the subtlety arising from Cavaradossi’s distracted, duplicitous scene with Tosca at the beginning of the opera but he was streets ahead of Viorel Zgarden, the fugitive Angelotti, who here appears to have no sense of physical urgency.Vladimir Dragos as Scarpia and Natalia Margarit in the title-role both gave winning performances. Though relatively small in stature, Dragos maintains constant physical power over Tosca as he forces her to submit to his long-standing desire for her and proves skin-crawlingly unyielding when ordering the torture of her lover Cavaradossi in his plan to break her down. Margarit brings a vocal and emotional warmth to her role.However, some of the richness this creates is undermined by the use of a stunt artist – ‘double’ would unfortunately not be the word – to make Tosca’s fatal leap from the castle battlements. This results in a hurried and unengaging suicide without so much as a cry of despair. After so much suffering, Tosca deserves better than that.

Set in an early nineteenth century German town with its archetypal inn, cobbled square, clocktower and deep dark forest just a few leagues away, Pullman weaves a fantastic tale. It is too complex for me to go into here but as Fritz, our storyteller, says: “A well-told story’s like a well-made clock, relentlessly unfolding till the final tock.”Stephen McNeff’s music is full of witty invention and played with gusto by eight young performers of The Philharmonia Orchestra’s Martin Musical Scholarship Fund, an award system created to help post-graduate students make the transition from student to working professional.Russel Craig’s fantastic dark blue Glockenheim clocktower – part mediaeval sundial, part heavenly pointer – provides a strong central element around which the story literally revolves. Jeanine Davies’ lighting is eerily atmospheric.The cast of eight, most playing a role within a role, sing and act superbly and manage to convey explicitly the complicated tale to child and adult alike. Peter Willcock is outstanding as Fritz the storyteller. Ian Jervis is a proud clockmaker and a noble Baron. Anna Boucher is a comely landlady and a regal Princess Mariposa while Zoe Todd as Prince Florian with a clockwork heart moves like a marionette but sings like an angel. Bass Martin Nelson’s entrance as the demonic Dr Kalmenius provides one of the most hair-raising moments of this compulsive tale. Darren Fox brings a wide range of emotions to the apprentice Karl and also to Prince Otto, whose child is so frail. Kevin West is excellent as the Burgomaster and Bernadette Lord sings sweetly as Gretl.As an introduction for children to the power of opera, that magic mix of words and music, Clockwork provides some impressive material.

Tell that snobbish and sexist nonsense to the opera-lovers who will pack no less than 45 main UK houses over the next five months to enjoy both the spectacular staging and fine singing of the Chisinau National Opera, presented by the largest single provider of opera throughout the UK – and a woman at that.Puccini’s tale of the ice-maiden princess whose suitors face death if they fail to answer three riddles correctly benefits from stunning sets and costumes by Alexander Okun and three outstanding soloists. Ellen Kent is never afraid to augment her touring Eastern European companies with experienced international artists and here Rome-based soprano Natalia Margarit and Korean-American counterpart Rosa Lee Thomas sing with great purity in the title role and as the slave girl Liu, while at the same time contrasting their respective power complex and innocence to strong effect.The controlled phrasing of Russian tenor Akhmed Agadi as Turandot’s would-be lover Calaf makes the familiar Nessun Dorma aria seem new-minted. Vladimir Dragos, Anatol Arcea and Vasile Micusa add Gilbert and Sullivan-style business to the three meddlesome ministers Ping, Pang and Pong and the orchestra, under Nicolae Dohotaru, is on this occasion particularly impressive in the brass section.

Sometimes in the past his stage images have run away with him but here everything is lucid and purposeful. A notable feature of his design is a kind of Welsh dresser containing the tools of Sweeney’s trade.The title role is firmly characterised and resonantly sang by Paul Hegarty and Karen Mann relishes her part of Mrs Lovett – you can almost hear her lips sacking as she contemplates the business possibilities of combining murder with pie-making.Doyle is again working fruitfully with his regular musical partner Sarah Travis and his excellent company of actor/musicans do him proud.

As the screen rises to reveal the stage the diagram’s white outlines are replaced by wooden struts indicating empty walls and doors, through which we see a number of rooms simultaneously. This transparency in George Souglides’ stage design helps maximise The Marriage of Figaro’s farcical nature.Stephen Langridge adds plenty of novel touches – the arrival at the close of the opera of the nuptial bed for which Figaro has been searching in an Ikea catalogue at the beginning, the awkward, long-suffering Cherubino, modelled on Harry Enfield’s Kevin and Perry, the stuttering recitatives of the lawyer Don Curzio. But Langridge’s main achievement lies in the confident comic acting across the cast. In this respect Claire Booth (Susanna) is as natural in movement and facial expression as she is vocally and is partnered by an equally charismatic Figaro in Manolis Papadakis. Jose Aparicio (Don Basilio) makes a striking presence.Almaviva (John Lofthouse) seems less than even vocally, to my mind only commanding attention in his angry Act III aria ‘Vedro mentrõio sospiro’. Sian Edwards conducts the Guildhall orchestra with panache, though this first night brought some passages of ambiguous ensemble with soloists. The Italian singing is good throughout, though surtitles might still have been a helpful inclusion.

The young Russian conductor lives up to his already impressive reputation with a thrilling account of the lyricism and passion of what he believes to be the best-ever Russian opera.Amanda Roocroft, taking on the demanding role of Tatyana for the first time, gives a studied restrained portrayal while giving full rein to the emotion of the pivotal letter scene. Marius Brenciu as the gentle naive poet Lensky is quite outstanding. In the title role of the cold-hearted dandy Vladimir Moroz, while rising to the necessary power in the final act, finds the character’s youthful detached boredom and world-weary cynicism less easy to convey.As Gremin, Brindley Sherratt’s moving tribute to his wife is beautifully projected, while Ekaterina Semenchuk is a spirited Olga and Michael Clifton-Thompson makes a delightful cameo of Triquet. Strong support is provided by Suzanne Murphy as Larina and Linda Ormiston as Filipyevna.James Macdonald’s unfussy production is hampered by the angular settings of Tobias Hoheisel, who also designed the attractive costumes. Confining the action within picture-framing arches, hedges and pillars emphasises the intimacy the opera requires. Nevertheless, this proves rather cramped for the chorus, particularly in the dances choreographed by Stuart Hopps. Presumably this also contributes to the lengthy scene change breaks which militate against maintaining the mood of the tragic love story.

This concert performance of Rossini’s neglected work is played, conducted and sung to the highest standards.The opera itself was written in Naples in 1819. A dark and complex tale set in the aftermath of the Trojan War, it tells of the Greek princess Hermione, so overwhelmed by jealousy at her betrothed Pyrrhus marrying her hated Trojan rival Andromache that she has her suitor Orestes murder him.Rossini clothes this tale in probing and inventive music that broke the mould at the time. Ermione failed because it was too avant-garde. Now it is revealed as a masterpiece.Talented young conductor Dominic Wheeler drives the performance along, drawing wonderful results from Chelsea’s forces.Patricia Bardon’s rich mezzo, with a contralto lower register, gives her the necessary warmth for Andromache. John Upperton’s fluency and facility in the high register bring him success as Pyrrhus and Justin Lavender’s equally adroit tenor singing defines a memorable Orestes.But it is today’s queen of bel canto, Nelly Miricioiu, who takes on the greatest challenge with the enormous, arduous and hugely technically demanding title role. Shaping every phrase with skill and artistry and maintaining throughout the grandeur of a great tragedienne, she brings home the terror and pathos of a woman who destroys herself through destroying the man she loves.This is a triumph for Miricioiu, for Chelsea Opera Group and for Rossini.

A handful of phrases sound uncomfortable and it is probably not a role she should sing regularly.That said, an artist of Roocroft’s perception and natural warmth finds many details with which to colour it her own. Memorable indeed are her facial expressions during Butterfly’s long night of vigil. These and other touches resonate and bring her genuine success with the part, even though by the skin of her vocal teeth.Marco Berti repeats his Pinkerton – an ample and imposing Italian tenor of genuine quality. Dramatically, he presents the American sailor as an out and out swine, which if not subtle is at least easy to reconcile with the text.Jane Irwin’s Suzuki is purposeful and determined but Slovak baritone Dalibor Jenis’ Sharpless is a cipher, missing many opportunities. His lower register is weak.Among the smaller roles, Darren Jeffery provides a thoroughly authoritative Bonze and Harry Nicoll a perfectly realised Goro, while John Bernays acquits himself finely as Yamadori. Making something out of practically nothing, Alan Duffield registers as Butterfly’s uncle Yakuside.New also is French conductor Philippe Auguin, who fails to maintain the dynamism that Puccini’s score demands for its devastating emotional charge to explode.
