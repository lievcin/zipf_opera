0,"Vanessa, Glyndebourne review - blowsy histrionics and a great finale",Vanessa,Glyndebourne,2018-08-06,David Nice,"""Sounds like an opera by Handel,"" said a friend when I told him that I was going to see Vanessa at Glyndebourne. Possible – the name first appeared in print as ""invented"" by Jonathan Swift in 1723 – had Handel not stuck to mythological and Biblical subjects, The title in fact has an incantatory ring in an overheated piece of hokum concocted by Samuel Barber and his long-term partner Gian Carlo Menotti for the Met in 1958. Glyndebourne often felt too small a space for its blowsy histrionics, but conductor Jakub Hrůša, director Keith Warner and a splendid team of singers did it proud. I won't need to see it again.Much ink has been spilled over how Vanessa has suffered relative neglect because it came to light in a world, or at least a Europe, dominated by the Darmstadt-school avant-garde; its time has come, many say. But true tonally-based masterpieces of the 1950s – Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress, Britten's Billy Budd and The Turn of the Screw, Tippett's The Midsummer Marriage and Poulenc's Dialogues des Carmélites – have made their own way. Vanessa's real problem is that it starts at screaming pitch, both in the orchestra – those shrieking high woodwind – and the female voices, leaving the music-drama few places to go and our sympathy for the Gothic ladies untouched. Yes, it has one of the most mesmerising finales in opera, a canon-quintet which gives a wider context at last, and a couple of effective set-pieces along the way, but its substance feels ersatz, contrived; was it a work the composer had to write? Even this excellent production and the commitment of the performers didn't convince me so. Middle-aged beauty Vanessa lives in a mansion somewhere in Northern Europe circa 1905 – Warner takes it back to America and updates to the time of the opera's composition – where she has dimmed the lights and covered the mirrors waiting for the return of the lover she last saw 20 years ago. In a neat little homage to Strauss's Arabella, it's his son of the same name who returns – or is it? He seduces her presumed niece on his first night as guest; the odd and sometimes compelling drama unfolds from that Liebesnacht. (Pictured above: Edgaras Montvidas as Anatol and Emma Bell as Vanessa)Warner has the clever idea of going against the mirror-covering and making this a drama of nothing but reflections. Ashley Martin-Davis's spare but haunting designs with their limited colour-palette work superbly – they would have given Stefan Herheim's ice-cold Glyndebourne production of Pelléas et Mélisande a better context than the organ-room facsimile we got there – and there's a further dimension in Alex Uragallo's black-and-white projections, moving in and out of focus. These also justify the 1950s setting; though Hitchcock mostly exploited technicolor in that decade, the thriller aspect is well observed. All the more pity, then, that Barber doesn't rise to the memorability of Bernard Herrmann's Hitchcock scores until the final scene (when Vertigo comes to mind). Emma Bell and Virginie Verrez complement each other superbly as the two leading ladies, Bell's compellingly cloudy tone with its brilliant upper reaches is right for the older woman, Verrez sharing her intensity as the dramatic screw turns in the evening's second half. Edgaras Montvidas brings the original creator of the role of Anatol, Nicolai Gedda, to mind in the briefly memorable duet with Vanessa in Act II (though even this is defused by one of Menotti's typically overblown lines, ""like the burning phoenix you flew out of the ashes of my shattered dreams""). The charmer remains a cipher, which is no doubt the point. Rosalind Plowright makes her presence felt in the vocally unrewarding role of the Old Baroness, Vanessa's mother, who sings only to those who connect to life. Donnie Ray Albert makes what he can of the Old Doctor, introduced a little too self-consciously for semi-comic relief.No-one could make a better argument for the score than the magnificent and ever-collegial Hrůša; a focused London Philharmonic Orchestra burns for him and Glyndebourne is lucky to welcome back its former regular who has now shaped up as one of the world's great conductors. That he considered the score worth his time speaks well for it. The quirky woodwind solos and the weirdness of the forest music, the little patches of Puccinian lyricism and, of course, that final quintet are memorable and even ear-wormy. The party scene (pictured above) has its nightmarish quirks (though Blitzstein's in Regina, a more deserving opera adapted from Lilian Hellman's The Little Foxes, is better still). Too much, though, is crashing cymbals and overwrought screams, and do we care about any of the characters? Vanessa is no great beauty, and one hopes that next time Glyndebourne fills its rarity spot with something on a higher level.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/vanessa-glyndebourne-review-blowsy-histrionics-and-great-finale,3
1,"Proms 25 / 26 review - Russian masters, noodling guitar, late-night perfection",Proms 25 / 26 review - Russian masters,noodling guitar,2018-08-03,David Nice,"Sometimes the more modestly scaled Proms work best in the Albert Hall. Not that there was anything but vast ambition and electrifying communication from soprano Anna Prohaska and the 17-piece Il Giardino Armonico under Giovanni Antonini, making that 18 when he chose to take up various pipes (★★★★★). By contrast the big BBC commission from Joby Talbot to write a work for much-touted guitarist Miloš Karadaglić and orchestra in the evening's first Prom left very little impression. Praise be, then, to Glinka and Tchaikovsky for showing what glittering substance is all about, and to Alexander Vedernikov for perfection of style in both (★★★★).It was obvious the BBC Symphony Orchestra should ask the one-time Bolshoi chief conductor back for Tchaikovsky ballet music after they excelled together at the Barbican in the composer's Third Orchestral Suite. In the event, their Nutcracker Act One turned into an exquisitely poignant tribute. The great Gennady Rozhdestvensky died on 16 June, and the orchestra dedicted the concert to his memory. I well recall his quirky Festival Hall performance with a rather less refined BBCSO of the complete Sleeping Beauty back in the 1980s, and their two Prom performances of the last ballet's second act, one of them happily available on DVD, needed completing with the first act. Vedernikov is no disappointment as a successor; though by and large less eccentric than Rozhdestvensky in his gestural repertoire, he too knows exactly how to scale, to tense and release, the miraculous sequence of inspirations in ever-original orchestrations Tchaikovsky packs into 45 minutes. The Miniature Overture – violins and violas only among the strings – gave notice of an intimately scaled Christmas party, strings as a whole light and spry for the dances and toy-giving around the tree, though there were some surprises in slower tempi which worked. All the more impressive, then, the symphonic scale the ballet takes on after midnight, with the two big transformation scenes justifying their concert context in a big and airy space.Above all, though, it was the BBCSO's woodwind department – I don't know a more characterful one in any orchestra – which underlined the strangeness of Tchaikovsky's special magic. The clarinet family had a field day with Hoffmanesque oddity Dr Drosselmeyer and his peculiar gifts, underpinned by singing personality from first bassoonist Julie Price. The final icing on the cake, even if it is a bit sugary (the lady in our row decided to sing along), comes from the youthful voices cutting through the snow-scene, courageously taken by the Finchley Children's Music Group. Few will have heard father of Russian music Glinka'a Summer Night in Madrid, otherwise his Second Spanish Overture, anywhere live before, and certainly not at the Proms. Its candid, lean orchestration, giving Tchaikovsky the cue for selective groups of instruments, came hand in glove with a dance-lilt and an elegance that Vedernikov encouraged from his spirited players. Joby Talbot could have taken a leaf or two out of Glinka's art; his own is multi-purpose glitter which is fine, if a bit too much of a good thing, in his score for the Royal Ballet's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, but exposed in its lack of real substance in a concert work like Ink Dark Moon.Left alone or with eerie string support, Miloš – as he's still marketed – created discreetly-amplified atmosphere which could evoke the intended scene, Northern California's Sierra Nevada. The problem was in the vigorous ensembles, more like music for BBC classic drama than anything bolder, where the guitar was simply swamped, in the hall at least, and subordinate to what themes there were from the woodwind. The expected solo encore, José Luis Merlin´s Evocación, was short, generic and artistically done.For meaning and depth, the Tchaikovsky and the late-night Prom eclipsed the new concerto in every way. Difficult to count those ways in Prohaska's only-connect programme with Il Giardino Armonico, which has had time to acquire depth since the programme's indispensible CD release (as ""Serpent and Fire""). It came across as a compact but in some ways epic five-act opera interweaving the fates of Dido and Cleopatra, with equally compelling instrumental interludes like the startlingly sombre Handel C minor Concerto Grosso as a central divertissement for the shades of Hades, and some startling but always successful segues. Cleopatra and her musicians – upper strings standing to take advantage of free movement – danced vivaciously in two delicious arias from Sartorio's 1676 Giulio Cesare in Egitto and Egyptian Princess Menalippe's joyous pastoral from Christoph Graupner's German/Italian-language Dido. It wasn't only here that Prohaska used her whole body to express the music, the gestures always organic, never mannered.Best of all, what we would normally call ornamentation in repeats came over as the highest creativity, bringing new expression and depth to what always seemed like emotional substance. Prohaska packs an amazing amount of tone-colour and projects textural meaning into every phrase. An element of crowd-thrilling display was inevitable in the fiery defiance of Hasse's Cleopatra, but in two known classics, Prohaska simply seemed to go deeper than any other interpreter of Handel's Egyptian queen (with ""Se pietà di me non senti"") and Purcell's Dido (astonishing new decorative/expressive invention and full dramatic voice, as in the Handel, for the key laceration, in the famous Lament).This was also a masterclass in a singer's fusion with her fellow musicians, trills in perfect accord and a joy as well as a profound seriousness in music-making that gave us the perfect, tiny encore, Purcell's ""Fear no danger to ensue"", the wonderful Antonini taking up the second voice in instrumental guise. A clear highlight of the Proms season and of the musical year as a whole, whatever's still to come.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music-opera/proms-25-26-review-russian-masters-noodling-guitar-late-night-perfection,
2,"SWAP'ra Gala, Opera Holland Park review - all-women stars and scenes",SWAP'ra Gala,Opera Holland Park,2018-08-01,David Nice,"Two women, Julia Sporsén's female Composer and Jennifer France's Zerbinetta in Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos, stole most hearts with their togetherness at Holland Park recently. Many more trod similar air last night in favour of a down-to-earth cause, supported by other women as orchestral players, conductors, directors and stage crew.The wider aims of the newly founded SWAP'ra - Supporting Women and Parents in Opera - include encouraging leaders in the field who redress the balance so that we end up no longer appending ""women"" to conductors, directors and composers; check out the neatly-presented percentages on the organisation's excellent website if you don't think there's a problem. More specifically, it already has two firm objectives: to encourage directors and companies to give out schedules well in advance to enable family planning, so to speak, and to get more opera houses to provide creche/childcare facilities, as OHP and Scottish Opera already do. Founder members - the directors Ella Marchment and Sophie Gilpin along with singers Anna Patalong, Madeleine Pierard and Kitty Whately (pictured above as Monteverdi's Nero - nominally, at least, since the final duet is by another composer - to Anna Devin's Poppea) - did a slick shared job of presenting their cause; then the ever-spirited Fiona Shaw spoke further on the necessities of the life-work balance before introducing no less than 17 operatic excerpts familiar and not, featuring 42 soloists, two choruses, four conductors led by the engaging Jessica Cottis in charge of a full orchestra, and 10 directors.Galas are tricky things, especially when you're aiming as they were last night straight for the deeply emotional essence. You can't do such things on a wing and a prayer; owing to the generosity of the performers in squeezing appearances into a busy schedule, time here must have been short. So inevitably there was some unevenness in presentation, the sense that some scenes could have been more extended for full impact and others placed differently in the programme. But overall they got the balance right, and did us all especially proud in bringing to light the new. Mark Adamo's Little Women hasn't been seen in the UK; its quartet finale is, perhaps inevitably, American-sentimental, but not necessarily in a bad sense, and its emotion was finely trammelled by Jennifer France's Amy, Rebecca Caine's Beth, Beth Moxon standing in for Karen Cargill as Meg and Lucy Schaufer as Jo (pictured above). We had a sneak preview of Welsh National Opera-commissioned Rhondda Rips It Up! by Elena Langer, catching not the promised raciness of its music-hall style but the pathos with Emma Carrington in the prison solo of Welsh suffragette Margaret Haig Thomas, Lady Rhondda. The real modernism came in a taster of Josephine Stephenson's Les constellations, une théorie, bewitchingly articulated by Gillian Keith and Caroline MacPhie (pictured below) in perfect accord with Cottis and the orchestra - the most surprising highlight. As all works were sung in their original languages - Stephenson's in excellent French - there was a challenge to put across the meaning. Top-notch in that respect were Jeni Bern's unusual, modern Fiordiligi in tandem with Sarah Tynan's experienced Despina and Katie Bray's Dorabella, and Catherine Wyn-Rogers' obdurate but not inhuman Zia Principessa giving Puccini's adored Suor Angelica (Anne Sophie Duprels) the awful news about the child from whom she's been separated. The women's quartet from Act 2 of Britten's Peter Grimes also went straight to the heart, with measured characterisations from Giselle Allen (Ellen Orford), Yvonne Howard (Auntie) and Rebecca Bottone and Gillian Ramm as the Nieces (pictured below). Amidst the luxury of great British names - Amanda Roocroft, poised and gracious as ever, moving from her memorable Tatyana at the Royal Opera to the charming mother (pictured below with Katherine Broderick as Tatyana, Angela Simkin as Olga and Fiona Kimm as Filipyevna), Janis Kelly as the Marschallin to the Octavian of Diana Montague, still in fine voice - there were reminders of the outstanding voices many of us have been missing. Outstandingly so Meeta Raval, whom I haven't seen since her distinguised performance in the 2013 BBC Cardiff Singer of the World final, as a perfect-phrasing Butterfly, in tandem with Carolyn Dobbin's equally lustrous Suzuki (shame they had to do pointless things with crates; scattering blossoms would have been enough not to get in the way of this musically ravishing Flower Duet). Clearly we should see Jennifer Johnston as Britten's Lucretia soon, and there was poised perfection from Whately's Nero and Devin's Poppea. This was a lesson in restrained but telling direction from Robin Norton-Hale, who also handled Constellations so well.As the full company finally assembled for a lusty group finale singing an anthem by Pankhursts young and old, there was just one nagging question: you're cracking the women issue, with which of course there's never been a problem as far as operatic roles are concerned; it's in the other fields that attention needs to be paid. But what about the diversity? Next stop, obviously, Chineke! in opera.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/swapra-gala-opera-holland-park-review-all-women-stars-and-scenes,4
3,"Pagliacci, Scottish Opera review - roll up, roll up for opera like never before!",Pagliacci,Scottish Opera,2018-07-30,Miranda Heggie,"Yes it’s opera, but not as you know it. The circus-tent style structure, pitched on the grounds of Seedhill sports complex and dubbed ""Paisley Opera House"", was home this weekend to Scottish Opera's incredible, immersive production of Leoncavallo’s Pagliacci. With the opera itself set both onstage and backstage, it was impossible to distinguish between the audience, chorus, cast and crew. The performance truly enveloped the audience, bringing them right into the magic of the storytelling.At its heart, Bill Bankes-Jones's production sought to be fun for everyone involved. The pre-show entertainment featured magicians, a Punch and Judy show, face-painting and even boxes of novelty hats for people to wear. I donned a policewoman’s cap, while my friend wore a beret made of something resembling astroturf with a golf tee in the centre and a miniature golf ball swinging from a string; sadly, the queue for the face painting was a bit too long. At this stage, Scottish Opera’s Music Director Stuart Stratford introduced the orchestra, whose players sat, in civvies, on the only bit of staging that looked like an actual stage. Members of the crowd were invited to have a shot at conducting the orchestra, adding to the friendly, laid back feel of it all. As the overture began, bass baritone Robert Hayward, singing the role of Tonio, emerged, not from behind the curtain, but from a Scottish Opera trailer parked in the area, with the character’s reminder that actors are people, with real emotions too. The role of Canio – Pagliaccio when we get to Act Two’s ""play within a play"" – was sung by Ronald Samm, whose rich, bold tenor was perfectly suited to the role (pictured above for the big aria). The chorus, comprising professional singers and members of the local community, were interspersed throughout the audience, and burst into song in a sort of flash mob fashion. As I wandered round the arena it was lovely to hear individual voices and snippets of each part sung so close to me, an experience which could never happen within the confines of a traditional opera house.The chorus singers then took audience members, some by the hand, round to where Canio’s wife Nedda, sung by Anna Patalong, awaited a visit from her lover Silvio. Dressed in shorts and a Scottish Opera crew T-Shirt, with a toolbelt round his waist, Australian baritone Samuel Dale Johnson looked every inch the theatre techie as he climbed up to Nedda’s window. His duet with Patalong, as the characters planned their elopement, was charged with a real, raw emotion as they honestly illuminated the all too human issues of forbidden lust and illicit thrills. Left in despair at the discovery of his wife’s infidelity, Canio, ironically, must prepare to play a clown, and Samm gave a strong portrayal of the character’s anguish in his aria at the end of the first act. The second started with a bit of a (planned) commotion as benches were carried through the crowd and placed in front of the stage, which was made from aforementioned trailer. The show is about to begin! Nedda’s character Columbina (Patalong pictured above), Pagliaccio’s wife, wore a sugar-plum fairy type dress, with a skirt which resembled pink fluffy candy floss under a Tunnock's teacake wrapper. With the set’s bright blue and yellow walls, and Pagliaccio's clown suit, visually, the scene popped. It was no less impressive musically, with stellar performances from the cast, and the orchestra adding vibrant swathes of colour as the opera drew to its tragic close.Performances such as this are often difficult to get right. Anything that’s ""immersive"" can often be awkward, cringeworthy, and even a bit rubbish. This was none of these. Both artistically and practically everything went off without a hitch, and above all, it was brilliant fun.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/pagliacci-scottish-opera-review-roll-roll-opera-never,4
4,"Saul, Glyndebourne review - from extravaganza to phantasmagoria",Saul,Glyndebourne,2018-07-20,David Nice,"It's swings and roundabouts for Glyndebourne this season. After the worst of one director currently in fashion, Stefan Herheim, in the unhappy mésalliance of the house's Pelléas et Mélisande, only musically gripping, comes the already-known best of another, Barrie Kosky. His Royal Opera Carmen and The Nose were half brilliant, half misfire; Handel's cornucopia of invention, never richer, in the very operatic oratorio Saul brings out a hallucinatory vision from Kosky that works from start to finish.The one reservation this time round would have to rest with the characterisation of the eponymous Biblical king, stricken by an envy of the young Goliath-slayer David that Kosky enlarges as mental illness. Alexandra Coghlan described Christopher Purves's performance in 2015 as ""an extraordinary piece of singing-acting that makes madness – unlovely, vulnerable, mercurial – poignantly human"". I can well imagine it of a remarkable performer currently hampered by Herheim as a totally repulsive Golaud in the Glyndebourne Pelléas. Markus Brück is a powerful vocal presence, but ""poignantly human"" his Saul is not. There's too much stumble acting and juddering. That still doesn't detract from the strangeness of his Timon-like descent into the dust, encounter with the saggy-dugged Witch of Endor - John Graham-Hall, in not inappropriately ragged voice - and channelling of the prophet Samuel's voice in Part II (pictured below). What remarkable music-theatre Handel makes this, in any case. The quickfire succession of shorter arias in dramatic sequence is electrifyingly supported by Laurence Cummings and an Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment expanded to unusual Handelian proportions (if you didn't see the production first time round, there's one delicious surprise in the organ-concerto dimension). And the choruses blister, as one would expect from the usual crack band of young soloists-of-the-future that has always been a Glyndebourne hallmark (pictured below; other country houses are happily following suit these days, with rich pickings from the music colleges). There can't have been a more rewarding production for them, nor one in which they have to work harder. As in the Royal Opera Carmen, they move and occasionally dance together with the six brilliant dancers in Otto Pichler's trademark choreography – high-quality camp until the sudden seriousness at the start of Part II, one routine you won't have seen in a Kosky production before. And they bring Charles Jennens's superb texts on envy to excoriating life. Unquestionable star of a fine vocal line-up is Iestyn Davies's David. There isn't a more exquisite nor, when needed, penetrating countertenor sound to be heard on the operatic stage today, he can do the strange gravitas of the character and, let's face it, he's in good shape too (singers these days probably spend as much time down the gym as they do in the rehearsal room). Contrasting soprano timbres from the bright, incisive Anna Devin and the more voluptuous-toned Karina Gauvin as the two very different daughters of Saul bid welcome to further pleasures.There are two top tenors on stage – Allan Clayton as the doting Jonathan, not his most rewarding part but sympathetic enough, and Stuart Jackson, who deals with more idiosyncrasy to perfection in four roles, not least a few ringing lines as ""an Amalekite"" on the auditorium field of battle (pictured below, with Jackson back in his first role). The production's various coups have been well rehearsed in the review of the original production, but it's important to stress that none is gimmicky, even if the spectators are almost moved to applaud on the two curtain-ups (not being Americans, for the most part, they don't). Though a portable show, thanks to what Kosky calls the ""extravagant minimalism"" of using people as the props, every stage picture is a work of art in Katrin Lea Tag's design and Joachim Klein's oftewn numinous lighting. Essentially it's a stripping away, from the rigid symmetries of the first part – a few more angles might make the drama feel less long, though the singing and playing always beguile – to the very dark endgame of the later stages, rich in perspectives and symmetries with the opening scenes. Although there's now a DVD of the first run, no-one should miss Kosky's Saul in the theatre. Perhaps Glyndebourne could now think about Nielsen's magnificent Saul and David.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/saul-glyndebourne-review-extravaganza-phantasmagoria,4
5,"L'Ange de Nisida / JPYAP Summer Programme, Royal Opera - buoyant touch in Donizetti bagatelle",L'Ange de Nisida / JPYAP Summer Programme,Royal Opera,2018-07-19,David Nice,"Two rules should help the non-Donizettian: avoid all stagings of the prolific Bergamasco's nearly 70 operas other than the comedies; and seek the guarantee of top bel canto stylists. Conductor Mark Elder and soprano Joyce El-Khoury certainly fit that bill, and a straight concert performance of L'Ange de Nisida, given at the Royal Opera in association with Opera Rara, got it exactly right. You had to credit the hard work of reconstruction, too, on this opera semiseria which never reached the stage but was expanded, with a similar plot line and several of the same characters, as the relatively familiar La Favorite.The essence gives a slight kick to the Italian-opera love triangle: the church's intervention in the Neapolitan King's pursuit of his Spanish mistress Sylvia, secluded on a small island near Naples where the people love her angelic benificence, initiates a marriage of convenience to get her out of a difficult situation - but it's with the man she loves, and he doesn't know the nature of the set-up. For three-quarters of an undemanding but classy journey last night, the musical if not the dramatic pleasures are more than intermittent. It helps that, while complex characterisation isn't an option, Donizetti gives each of his five characters and the chorus distinctive music, and that here the casting was perfect. Most durable, for those of us who prefer the likes of L'elisir d'amore, Don Pasquale and La Fille du regiment (contemporary with L'Ange) to the operas with tragic endings, was the role of court manipulator Don Gaspar, taken in perfect buffo/bouffe style by the ever-charismatic Laurent Naouri (pictured above). His Act Three duet with his King - sung with ideal authority by Vito Priante - was a rollicking highlight.So, too, was the slow cantabile of Sylvia's aria which immediately follows, beautifully phrased by El-Khoury (pictured below with Priante and Elder). She was not on her best form, though, for the cabaletta, with occasional cloudiness in the upper register getting in the way of a seamless whole. The show-off triumph of the evening belonged to Korean tenor David Junghoon Kim. Musicality and the high notes just pour out of him, and his sensitivity in plangent moments was authentically Italianate, too. Elsewhere, Donizetti's originality flashes in tripping chorus, ensembles and some of the orchestral rejoinders in the recitative. There are even some felicitous touches of orchestration, like the woodwind for Leone's opening serenade and a mournful pair of horns, superb singers both. The religious music which accompanies the Monk - Russian Evgeny Stavinsky, a fifth nationality in a world-class line-up - moves from trombone-heavy threats, a new element in the early scenes, to cowled colours in the cloister. Would that the sudden seriousness of the lovers' music there, ending in a quite unnecessary death, was up to the mark. Donizetti seemed to like it enough to carry it through wholesale to La Favorite, but how we miss the lightness of earlier scenes.Elder, all the same, is spruce and supportive to his singers from first note to last, saving us from any sense of longueurs in what is, mercifully, a shorter opera than the baggy monster into which Donizetti transformed it. The Opera Rara recording based on these performances will certainly be a worthwhile addition to the Donizetti discography. Junghoon Kim is one of many brilliant graduates of the Jette Parker Young Artists Programme at the Royal Opera. In their annual showcase on Sunday afternoon another Korean tenor, Konu Kim, showed a lovable personality in excerpts from Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos - would that the conducting, of a surprising lumpiness from a big name, Jac van Steen, had served the dance-scene better - and the fizzing, onomatopoeic Act 1 finale of Rossini's L'Italiana in Algeri, the most successful staging in JPYAP producer Noa Naamat's armoury. (Kim pictured above on the right by Clive Barda with Simon Shibambu, Dominic Sedgwick, Haegee Lee, Sarah-Jane Lewis and Thomas Atkins)Naamat also took advantage of the lack of epilogue to Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress to give mad Tom Rakewell a suicide that turns into a slow, ever-brighter release from earthly cares. Thomas Atkins's characterisation was another highlight, with the right heartbreak from the last visit to Bedlam of Anne Trulove, poignantly sung by the ever radiant and characterful Francesca Chiejina. In an excerpt from Thomas's fitfully interesting Hamlet, superbly conducted by JPYAP repetiteur James Hendry, Jacquelyn Stucker (pictured below by Clive Barda) briefly amazed as Ophelia. There was promise, too, in the smoky chest voice of Sarah-Jane Lewis's Ariadne, though the top will need sorting before she makes an international career. On a day that also reminded us of the wonders of 40 years of BBC Young Musician at the Proms, and not long after JPYAP soprano Jennifer Davis made her name as Elsa in the Royal Opera Lohengrin, the long-term support of young artists' programmes like this struck as more indispensible than ever. As those two watershed occasions demonstrated, it's the post-training support system which really counts.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/lange-de-nisida-jpyap-summer-programme-royal-opera-buoyant-touch-donizetti-bagatelle,4
6,"Ariadne auf Naxos, Opera Holland Park - stylish staging, world-class singing",Ariadne auf Naxos,Opera Holland Park,2018-07-18,David Nice,"""When the new god approaches, we surrender, struck dumb"". Especially if, for the singer of those words, popular entertainer Zerbinetta, the “new god” takes the shape of same-sex love. Director and designer Anthony McDonald locates the real “mystery of transformation” with which Richard Strauss’s house-poet Hugo von Hofmannsthal was so infatuated in the coup de foudre between the not-so-fickle coloratura soprano and another woman as the (usually teenage and putatively male) Composer. That, along with everything else in this stylish, beautifully sung and finely acted production, has an irresistible logic, carrying even the most difficult aspects of a dramatically compromised but always ravishing-to-hear operatic hybrid. There's probably never going to be a perfectly-cast Ariadne in the opera house, but this comes closer than any I've ever seen live.The backstage business, in which a cabaret troupe (pictured below: Alex Otterburn's Harlequin, Jennifer France's Zerbinetta, Elgan Llŷr Thomas's Brighella and Daniel Norman's Scaramuccio) and the singers of a newly-composed opera seria find themselves ordered to carry on simultaneously at the whim of their rich patron, was tailor-made for the production's original Scottish Opera incarnation. It was an attractive idea to have the preparations sung in Helen Cooper’s English translation, with smatterings of Scottish vocab and a bit of filth thrown in for fun, before a spectacle sung in German. The executor of the unseen Maecenas's whims is not an uptight Major Domo but a Scottish Lady – was this an affectionate dig at a certain country-house event up near Aberdeen, I wonder? – played with eccentric panache by Eleanor Bron. Unfortunately she's the only one in the cast that needs miking: production notes would do best to make sure that happens for the remaining performances. Not that there's going to be competing action from a spat between dogs outside at a crucial moment on other evenings. There's nimble repartee with her from Stephen Gadd's spot-on Professor of Composition (Music Master in the original, and probably not the kind of figure to be condescending about “Johnny Foreigner Eurotrash"") and Jamie MacDougall's cabaret producer (Dancing Master). MacDougall could easily drop the effortful Cockney accent; he'd still be crisply funny without it. But the scene, and most hearts, I hope, are stolen from the first appearance of Julia Sporsén's adorable if volatile Composer, deeply simpatica. The role needs flaming soprano top notes – creator of the role, after all, was Lotte Lehmann – and Sporsén allies them to a plangent intensity I haven't seen to the same degree in the role since the young Maria Ewing took a Proms audience by storm on a Glyndebourne visit back in 1981.There hasn't been a more meaningful Zerbinetta, either, than young Jennifer France's; her mistake has been to look for Mr, rather than Miss, Right until the Composer comes along. She gets away with a squeeze at the very stratospheric top of the register in her display aria since it's so well directed and executed – from Victor/Victoria start to burlesque, gloves pulled off finger by finger to cadenza trills, abetted by Alex Otterburn's excellent Harlequin. As the music declares, this Zerbinetta moves from truth to pretty artifice, and the costume change reflects that. The ""Harlequinade"" has genuinely funny gags, no doubt encouraged by that most original of choreographers Lucy Burge. To explain them would be a comedy spoiler, so let's just say the team – quirkily completed as a metro/pansexual group by Daniel Norman, Lancelot Nomura and Elgan Llŷr Thomas – have taken the hint of ""Greek,"" ""sea"" and ""island"" for a curious melee, “improvising” brilliantly with dinner-table and other props. Thanks to the vivacity of Brad Cohen's always singer-friendly conducting, the mythological stretches don't drag, even if a fault of the 1916 opera-with-prologue is to let them get too protracted an upper hand. Wolfgang Göbbel's chameleonic lighting immediately transports us to a different world (pictured above). McDonald seems to take a leaf out of Christof Loy's long-serving Royal Opera production by making Ariadne a betrayed contemporary woman, with a twist that she's a kind of Miss Havisham deserted on her wedding day, saved from decay by the arrival of a new love she takes to be death. Kor-Jan Dusseljee’s Bacchus isn't love's young dream – which tenor with the lungs for this insanely ungrateful part is? – but once past the difficulty of Ariadne's acceptance, the tenderness between the middle-aged pair is convincing.Mardi Byers (pictured below with Dusseljee) is a dramatic soprano with a core of gold, taking the full weight up to the top with slightly hit-and-miss results. Yet it's a quality voice, like all the rest, right for this taxing Prima Donna role. Believably stricken, Byers' Ariadne mirrors her Composer’s suicidal tendencies with an equal potential for self-harm; both are “half in love with easeful death” until their “new gods” transfigure them.McDonald the designer moves from the three caravans parked outside the back of Holland House – wry shades, perhaps, of Richard Jones’s mobile homes for three sets of Glaswegian “witches” in his brilliant Verdi Macbeth, though these are representative of their performer inhabitants – to three exquisite costumes to match the tonal loveliness of the nymphs on Naxos (Elizabeth Cragg, Laura Zigmantaite and Lucy Hall). Their dresses are suggestive of their nature-magic, much needed as they spread batty white wings for the arrival of the god, in itself destined to be visually prosaic in this ""real"" depiction. Dusseljee’s slightly stiff silver fox, buttoned up in white suit, doesn’t need to be supernatural other than in voice (which he uses to sing softly, unlike most Bacchuses); the nymphs and the most sensuous of orchestras do the work of moving us.What a joy it is to hear top instrumentalists in the City of London Sinfonia like clarinettist Katherine Spencer work so closely with the singers; the 36-piece orchestra sounds absolutely incandescent in these surroundings. Add to that the fact that there’s a luminous aura of smiling confidence about the whole venture – it's had time to bed in, after all, since its Glasgow launch – and any earthly failings pale into insignificance. Everyone seems to know they're participating in something special. Satisfied with a very happy ending that even manages to evoke, stage-wise, the final love-triangle of Der Rosenkavalier, you can only float out into what last night was a sky with a touch of Titian blue behind a crescent moon, feeling that all is briefly right with the world.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/ariadne-auf-naxos-opera-holland-park-stylish-staging-world-class-singing,5
7,"Prom 5, Pelléas et Mélisande, Glyndebourne review - for the ears, not the eyes",Prom 5,Pelléas et Mélisande,2018-07-18,stephen Walsh,"What a fabulous score Pelléas et Mélisande is, and what a joy to be able to hear it in a concert performance without the distraction of some over-sophisticated director’s self-communings. Well, if only. What last night’s Prom in fact served up was a kind of abstract of Stefan Herheim’s Glyndebourne production, semi-staged by Sinéad O’Neill without its organ-room setting and all that that entailed, but with a great deal of its dramaturgical clutter still intact. This was emphatically a performance for the radio. I was in the Albert Hall, but I suspect the orchestral playing will have sounded about as technically and musically refined over the air as one could possibly wish, and even in the hall – if you could shut your eyes (and occasionally ears) to the downstage nonsense – the orchestral sound, under Robin Ticciati, was as nearly perfect as anything I’ve heard in these profound spaces for a very long time. The curious thing about this is that Debussy only orchestrated the opera – or at least only wrote the orchestration down – some years after the music itself was completed. Yet the whole score – voices and orchestra – sounds like a single, completely integrated concept, imagined all of a piece, and of an expressive subtlety and precision that perhaps only Mozart at his best ever surpassed.The director needs to clarify these things, not obscure themDavid Nice has already done the necessary Beckmesser job on Herheim’s dark fantasies, whose essence seems to survive in O’Neill’s actually somewhat more than semi staging. If these ideas – the incessant comings and goings of assorted servants, the seemingly irrelevant paintings and empty easels, Yniold’s sudden transgendering in his/her scene with Golaud, Golaud’s physical presence, acknowledged by Mélisande, throughout the final love scene, Pelléas’s reappearance as a walking corpse and Mélisande’s love-death in the final scene: if these ideas were baffling to a Glyndebourne audience who at least had the full context, imagine what any Prommer not acquainted with this marvellous and essentially lucid work might make of them. One even asked me in the interval what Yniold’s sex change with skirt and long hair meant. I struggled: well, hair is something of a motif (isn’t it?); Yniold is a boy played by a girl (isn’t he – well actually not originally, but let that pass). The worst of all this is that it blocks out the real significance of the scene, Golaud punishing his first wife (Yniold’s dead mother) for his failure with his second. Among other things Pelléas (like its near contemporary, Janacek’s Jenufa) is about disrupted family lines. The director needs to clarify these things, not obscure them.Vocally, though, the cast did well. I liked the Pelléas, John Chest, somewhat more than David Nice did, Christina Gansch’s Mélisande perhaps a fraction less. Chest may have profited from the acoustic space, but I thought his voice good for the part: a baritone slightly biased towards the top (this is said to have been Debussy’s own range, though heaven knows what his singing was like). Gansch also suits this music very nicely, but overacted, turning Mélisande into a nonstop Rossetti mobile, with waving body, flailing arms, and not much mystery.Christopher Purves will have sounded a strong Golaud on the airwaves, but was damaged onstage by his crusty, too-elderly image and too coarse persona. Golaud is a plain man but not a bad one, mystified by Mélisande but violent towards her only when her uncommunicativeness finally unhinges him.The Arkel, Brindley Sherratt, and the Geneviève, Karen Cargill (pictured above with John Chest), were strong by any standards, and Chloé Briot was a sound Yniold, though a boy is really needed, however hard to find. But the real heroes of the evening were unquestionably Ticciati and the London Philharmonic Orchestra. Whenever I found my irritation with the stage boiling over, I took refuge in the orchestra and the conducting and they never let me down.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music-opera/prom-5-pell%C3%A9as-et-m%C3%A9lisande-glyndebourne-review-ears-not-eyes,4
8,"Isabeau, Opera Holland Park review - Mascagni's lumpy Godiva-ride rarity",Isabeau,Opera Holland Park,2018-07-15,David Nice,"Valiant Opera Holland Park, always taking up the gauntlet for Italian operas which should mostly never be staged again. Worst was Zandonai's Francesca da Rimini, where musical ambition vastly outruns technique and inspiration. Mascagni's Iris with its hideous misogyny has now been followed by the same composer's Isabeau of 1911, turgid of libretto and dramaturgy. Leoncavallo's Zazà and Puccini's La rondine are in a different league, but both had already impressed London audiences in concert and at the Royal Opera respectively before travelling westwards. Here the heart sinks to see the same village-institute medievalism, with its creaking castle walls to match cardboard cut-out characters, that plagued director Martin Lloyd-Evans's almost unendurable Zandonai.This starts more promisingly, with six onstage trumpeters in livery – albeit two in specs - backing up the announcement of a joust for the hand of fair Isabeau, King Raimondo’s daughter, newly emerged from chaste retreat. Her entry, albeit not on the required white horse, and later her ride through the streets on a puppet-y one, naked in Godiva fashion at the behest of her angry father, both have radiant and interestingly scored music, even if the latter is very sub-Strauss (Mascagni must have been aware of Der Rosenkavalier, another, earlier premiere of 1911). Young Italian conductor Francesco Cilluffo gets especially lovely phrasing from lower strings, but has some trouble co-ordinating a wide spread of players (the percussionists, way to his right, aren’t always in synch). The results are good enough to suggest that a worthwhile orchestral suite could be made from some of the opera’s music.Yet oh, how it begins to drag when we switch to rural falconer Folco and his granny, come to court to beg a position for the young man; not even the ringing tones of the UK’s most Italianate tenor hope, David Butt Philip, can shine out fully given the limping pace and turgid text (by Illica, astonishingly, librettist of so many great Puccini dramas – what a good influence his co-writer Giacosa must have been). There’s a rather striking pre-tournament chorus, sounding oddly like something out of Tippett’s The Midsummer Marriage, premiered over 40 years later, and brilliantly sung (if over-acted in some cases - ditch the idiot) by OHP’s young and golden chorus. The shifting bits of scenery actually come together quite effectively for a pageant-tableau (pictured above). The outcome, you think, could be positive: Isabeau only accepts one of the five suitors, the (to us) hilariously-named Ethel, rival to ""Odoardo di Edimborgo"" and others, out of pity, not love. But then it all goes pear-shaped for the iconic virgin: this is when dad (stentorian Mikhail Svetlov) orders the Godiva ride.It doesn’t make much sense for the choral men to be brutalising their women after the interval when they agree to shut their windows to the sight of their naked lady and to punish anyone who looks on her with death. The one who happens to see her is the unfortunate Folco. Cue an inept end of scene and a final love-too-late semi-duet where Anne Sophie Duprels, always a strong presence on stage, warms up from her initial under-the-note delivery to match Philip for Italianate singing of great lustre. That’s ruined by another silly conclusion, for which Lloyd-Evans must be blamed as much as Mascagni and Illica. Well, it’s not a bore, if you must tick off these obscurities, but it is the sort of thing that gives opera a bad name, and the big question, to both Mascagni and OHP, has to be – why?",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/isabeau-opera-holland-park-review-mascagnis-lumpy-godiva-ride-rarity,3
9,"Ariadne auf Naxos, Longborough Festival review - appetising energy and wit",Ariadne auf Naxos,Longborough Festival,2018-07-14,stephen Walsh,"Much as I love Strauss’s Ariadne in its final form, I have a sneaking nostalgia for the original version (attached to Hofmannsthal’s adaptation of Molière’s Le bourgeois gentilhomme), which had Zerbinetta and her companions popping up after the final love duet and gently letting out some of its gas. Even in Alan Privett’s sparkling new production for Longborough, the too protracted revised ending threatens to die on its feet, and is kept alive only by the fine singing of the two principals, Helena Dix and Jonathan Stoughton, neither of them exactly sprightly actors, and by superb orchestral playing under Anthony Negus. Zerbinetta’s two-line interjection about “the new god” (alias Mr. Right) falls flat, as it usually does.But for all the work’s hybridities and oddities of balance, this is a highly enjoyable evening in the theatre. Privett’s brilliant stage management of the Prologue, with its Feydeauesque comings and goings and its not-quite serious handling of the age-old battle between Art and Mammon, prompts irreverent thoughts of how Zerbinetta and co might have livened up his production of The Ring here a few years back. The updated setting (functional designs by Faye Bradley) is in no sense a “concept,” like Daisy Evans’s Hollywoodisation of La Traviata, but simply a practical interpretation of the score’s actually very vague specification of period. It works a treat. The movement (by Michael Spenceley) is quick, alert and, for once, clear, and it beautifully reflects the mercurial texture of the music, with its rapid polyphony of motives and marvellously transparent chamber orchestration. For once the stage doesn’t get in the way of the music but supports it. And there are good laughs, not least for Anthony Wise’s dry, anglophone Major Domo (the opera being sung in German), and of course for Zerbinetta’s reductio ad absurdum of the Ariadne story. One emerges from all this invigorated and ready for one’s own supper before the more serious business on Naxos itself. This is naturally a more stately affair, with its Naiads, its morose and not altogether sylph-like Ariadne - a necessary contrast, perhaps, with Zerbinetta, who has to dance as well as sing (I tried to imagine these roles reversed, but failed). Zerbinetta’s “Grossmächtige Prinzessin” is too long for the dramatic context (as it is in Ariadne’s opinion), but is so stunningly dispatched by Robyn Allegra Parton that one wouldn’t shorten it by a single quaver; and the same goes for the ensuing scene with the four comedians, indescribably dressed as something akin to Nazi chauffeurs in silver lamé and see-through pantaloons, and performing immaculately as a team, Julien van Mellaerts’s Harlequin and Aidan Coburn’s Brighella are especially memorable. The cast generally has no weakness. Dix may be statuesque for the wrong reasons, but she is a well-focused soprano, more lyric than dramatic, and with a nice hint of self-parody as the Prologue’s prima-donna-ish Prima Donna. Stoughton can’t bring Bacchus to life as a character, but he can do the Heldentenor with a fine sweep, a pocket Siegfried who can let rip for twenty minutes without fear of the next two acts.Clare Presland (pictured above with Samuel Oram's lackey-technician) is deeply touching as the Composer, both in her scene with Zerbinetta and in her climactic “Musik ist eine heilige Kunst” (""music is a holy art'), after which she bows out (what a shame Strauss couldn’t bring himself to somehow include this character in the opera, being afraid, I suppose, that it would be identified with him).It’s a pleasure to hear Negus in something other than WagnerPresland sings radiantly apart from a tendency to croon on high sustained notes. And all the minor functionaries in the Prologue are incisively portrayed and strongly sung, notably Harry Nicoll as the comedians’ director (Dance Master) and  Darren Jeffrey as the Composer’s Music Master. The Norn-like Naiad, Dryad and Echo in the opera (Suzanne Fischer, Flora McIntosh, Alice Privett) sing sweetly and even have a Wagnerian rope, perhaps for boating as much as destiny-control. After all we are on an island, there are nets and fishing tackle, but alas, as usual in marine operas, no sign of the sea.It’s a pleasure to hear Negus in something other than Wagner, though Strauss admittedly failed to escape that influence as much as Hofmannsthal hoped. His weakest stretches are the most Wagnerian. But the best music also has a scuttling wit and intricacy, and a sort of late Verdi ellipsis, beyond what Wagner could usually manage, and here Negus shows a sense of pace out of a very different handbook. The accompaniment to Zerbinetta’s big rondo is a model in this respect, every detail in place, where even slight errors of timing could undermine the whole effect. And the playing is by far the best so far at Longborough this season.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/ariadne-auf-naxos-longborough-festival-review-appetising-energy-and-wit,5
10,"Alzira / The Daughter of the Regiment, Buxton Festival review – thundering good tunes",Alzira / The Daughter of the Regiment,Buxton Festival  – thundering good tunes,2018-07-11,Robert Beale,"Alzira is Verdi’s shortest opera and his least performed, and you have to ask why. Buxton International Festival has done his legacy a service by bringing it to the stage this year, and it completes the trilogy of early Verdi operas performed there in recent years under Elijah Moshinsky’s direction. Moshinsky sees its relevance to liberation struggles in the present day, with the Incas’ battles against the Spaniards re-presented as Latin American guerillas’ struggles against oppressive government now, or not so long ago.In Giovanna D’Arco in 2015, and last year Macbetto (the original 1847 version), he showed his awareness of human and relationship tensions in Verdi’s work and brought them clearly to the fore. In Giovanna D’Arco he dug deep into the mind of the heroine, as she heard voices, alternately of demons and angels, and was torn between their conflicting demands. In Macbetto he made use of every device he could to make the super-charged Romantic drama Verdi saw in it (video projection and sound effects – weather noises for the blasted heath, clanking and rumbling for the assembling army – evoked the scenario).Russell Craig as designer and Stanley Orwin-Fraser as video designer were used again here, with impressive results in evoking the natural beauty of the jungle as a contrast to the stifled atmosphere of power, presenting a wedding procession (albeit an abortive one), and reminding us of the human cost of political violence (pictured below). And, though the opera does not have the depth of much other Verdi, it has a concision of construction and kaleidoscopic variety of mood almost akin to fast-cut movie direction, and these mean it has much to offer still.The reason it doesn’t often get put on is probably to do with Cammarano’s plot (based on Voltaire): after being the clearly identified baddie through most of the story, the young military governor Gusmano – ready to humiliate Alzira’s rebel leader lover, Zamoro, and force Alzira herself to agree to loveless marriage with himself in order to save him – turns out, as he dies at the end, to rediscover his Christian power to forgive and thus prove himself humane after all (or something like that). It just doesn’t stack up psychologically. But on the positive side we have some thundering good tunes (with several marches and a drinking song), plus shock-horror moments, from Verdi, and with Stephen Barlow conducting again (his swan song, operatically, for the festival, I guess, as he is bowing out as artistic director), a strong cast and well-resourced company (a large incarnation of the Northern Chamber Orchestra, of course, and the Festival Chorus again effectively augmented by Young Artists), the musical results are first class. It’s stirring stuff, and Moshinsky’s direction is in much the same vein.Both the previous early Verdi productions by him at Buxton featured the considerable qualities of Kate Ladner as prima donna, and she took the title role in this one, also. She has the strength and stamina in her voice to do justice to the heroine’s depiction – tenderness and courage rapidly alternating (Verdi gives her tremolando violins to make the former clear, just as he did for Violetta later).Jung Soo Yun (Macduff in both Buxton and Opera North’s recent showings of Macbetto) cuts the right dash as Zamoro and is a very fine tenor for such man-of-action roles. James Cleverton has the unenviable task of being Gusmano and makes him as believable as probably anyone could, while singing with distinction. Graeme Danby brings maturity and experience to the part of Gusmano’s father, Alvaro.If Barlow and Moshinsky set out to make a case for early Verdi works to be considered for performance more often than they are, they have undoubtedly succeeded with this and their two earlier presentations. There really is life in the young dog yet, and his early tricks were pretty good ones.The Daughter of the Regiment, seen at Buxton the previous night (pictured below) and now on its way to Wilton’s Music Hall, is a complete contrast with both of the festival’s in-house shows this year. It’s wisely turned to Jeff Clarke and his Opera della Luna to make up the fun quotient. Donizetti’s comedy masterpiece needs singers of quality to do it justice. The famous tenor aria with the nine high Cs (""Ah! mes amis"") is in it, and there are soprano showpieces, too, and a clever trio (for which Clarke provides a little bit of choreography in almost Gilbert & Sullivan vein). Clarke is the master of transformations of comic opera, and he’s not only got John Longstaff to reduce the score – the chorus is all-male here, and three of the six singers double in other roles – but also re-written the book completely.""The Regiment"" is no longer a section of the French army operating in the rural Tyrol, but a desert-based Harley-riding biker gang in California, USA, and Sulpice is their president. The Marquise is now a Los Angeles social climber Marsha Berkenfield (she lives in West Hollywood, of course), and the Duchess of Crakentorp is heiress Dulcie Crackenthorpe. Marie, the daughter of the title, is still a lovely girl brought up by the good-hearted guys of The Regiment, and it’s all about her falling for Tonio – now an Hispanic immigrant, rather than a peasant – and then turning out, finally, to be the long-unacknowledged daughter of Marsha.It’s all great fun and very cleverly matches the original. It’s a second incarnation for Opera della Luna, as they did it four years ago for the Iford Festival, but it is a hugely entertaining gem of a show. Jesús Álvarez has got the top Cs – he doesn’t belt them out like a circus act, rather weaves them into the aria’s melody line, but they’re all there. And his Marie is Elin Pritchard, both a comedy actress and a wonderful soprano. Her finale aria to the first act (""Yes, we must part"") was lovely, and she made a delight of the ""singing lesson"" in act two (which Clarke transforms to include such lines as ""I dreamt I dwelt …"" and ""My tiny hand is …"" among the ditties). Toby Purser conducts the company, and a great little band, with skill.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/alzira-daughter-regiment-buxton-festival-review-%E2%80%93-thundering-good-tunes,4
11,"Idomeneo, Buxton Festival review - revolution in the head",Idomeneo,Buxton Festival,2018-07-09,Richard Bratby,"The audience at the Buxton International Festival has a way of cutting to the essence of a production. “They’ll have a job getting all that cutlery out of the sand” commented one of my neighbours after the end of Act One, where in Stephen Medcalf’s staging, Idomeneo (Paul Nilon) has just gone full operatic Mad Scene: hurling chairs, and sweeping an entire dinner service into the piles of sand that comprise much of the set. We’ll come back to the sand later. More significant, perhaps, is the fact that at the opera’s climactic scene, as Idomeneo prepares to sacrifice his son Idamante (Heather Lowe), he wigged out again, sending Idamante sprawling onto the floor. And that at this crucial point, people in several rows around me laughed out loud.Tut tut. Frivolous lot haven’t done their homework; shouldn’t be allowed to see Serious Opera (or at any rate opera seria) until they’re ready to approach it with the proper reverence. Well, no actually. The audience is always right. Shakespeare knew it; Mozart knew it; any intelligent theatre-maker today knows it. If the punters are laughing at a high tragedy by a supreme musico-dramatic genius, it’s the production or the performance that’s failed (at least at this point), not the public. And the question of why it did so here is interesting, because so much of Medcalf’s production is powerful, effective and thought-provoking.It certainly looks striking. Isabella Bywaters’s set presents a stark, neo-classical chamber overlooking a distant vista that might be sea, might be sky. Its doorways are clogged with piles of sand. Sands of time? Of memory? It’s dreamlike, an image from De Chirico or Magritte. It also dovetails elegantly with Medcalf’s stated vision of Idomeneo as a psychological drama: “not so much the boiling seas, shipwrecks, gods and sea monsters but what they represent”. Essentially, we’re inside the characters’ heads, and that means images and acting that tends towards the extreme. The curtain opens on Ilia (Rebecca Bottone, pictured below) chained to the wall: a woman literally at the end of her tether. Later we see Elettra’s tempestuous rage aria accompanied by synchronised flashes of lightning, and of course that cutlery-sweeping mad scene. To be fair, you do pity the stage manager.It’s a high-risk dramatic strategy, and when it works, it’s compelling. Happily, this is a cast unafraid to put their vocal firepower wholly at the service of the drama. Lowe’s Idamante’s hint of youthful swagger is matched by a warm, proud mezzo with a fine heroic ring – like Strauss’s Octavian grew up and knuckled down – while as Ilia, Bottone combines a wide-eyed intensity with singing of a plaintive, plangent sweetness that’s genuinely affecting, particularly in her aria with Idomeneo, ""Se il padre perdei"". It’s the subtlest and most expressive vocal performance I’ve heard from Bottone, and I’ve heard her Yum-Yum.Madeleine Pierard, meanwhile, is magnificently cast as Elettra. Her tone opens out to flashlight brilliance at the top of her register, while she sculpts phrases with such elegance that you really do get that sense of a personality about to crack. Pacing majestically about the stage in her magenta ballgown (costumes – vaguely 1920s, vaguely middle eastern banana republic – were by Bywaters too) she created some of the evening’s most haunting visual images, culminating in a final, troubling, disappearance from the stage as the chorus celebrated the statutory edifying ending. But none of it would fly without Idomeneo himself. Nilon (pictured below) gives us a three-hour portrait of mental and emotional disintegration: growing more haggard and hunched with each successive nervous crisis, and unsparing on his voice. It’s faded, frayed. At times it breaks into an outright snarl or strangled cry. Yet Nilon’s singing is always – from his first appearance to his final (and deeply moving) renunciation scene – lyrical, warm-centred and dignified.But still they laughed. I don’t think any of the individual performances were the cause, or indeed the staging as a whole (give or take the odd knife and fork, anyway). In fact, the most potentially risible scene – as the mysterious voice of Neptune lifts the curse on Crete – was remarkably effective and uncanny. Mozart’s trombones were supplemented by electronic echoes, and the divine judgement was delivered as though being mouthed by a momentarily-possessed Idomeneo himself. No, I suspect it’s that with a concept as utterly dependent on suspension of disbelief as this one, there’s no room for any slackening of tension. Yet throughout this opening performance there were brief pauses, gaps as scenery was repositioned, and – most crucially of all – an orchestral performance from Nicholas Kok and the Northern Chamber Orchestra that sounded as if they’d collectively selected “Mozart” from a stylistic drop-down menu, opted for elegance rather than electricity, and occasionally fluffed even that. Spirited choral singing couldn’t entirely compensate.True, ragged edges happen on hot days and first nights: and when Mozart himself slowed down, there was some lovely playing – the way the woodwind soloists draped themselves artlessly around Bottone’s voice in the above-mentioned aria will linger in the memory. But this whole production walks an emotional tightrope, and once that sags, repeated moments of high drama risk becoming absurd. You’re not ratcheting up the intensity, you’re just whacking characters on the head once too often. My hunch is that all these things can and possibly will tighten up during the run, possibly as soon as the second performance – and that audiences might well find themselves moved, gripped, and convinced that I’ve been very unfair indeed. I do hope so. Because they’re right.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/idomeneo-buxton-festival-review-revolution-head,3
12,"Pelléas et Mélisande, Glyndebourne review - frigid metatheatre",Pelléas et Mélisande,Glyndebourne,2018-07-01,David Nice,"Pierre Boulez simply crystallised the obvious when he described Debussy's unique masterpiece as ""theatre of cruelty,"" despite its enigmatic beginnings. Richard Jones, when I asked him to talk about its plot, declared ""it's about two men who love the same woman, with disastrous results"". Productions by Jones, Peter Stein with Boulez conducting and Vick at Glyndebourne have all had us shaking with fear and weeping with pity. By going much further in symbolic abstraction than even the playwright of Pelléas et Mélisande, Maurice Maeterlinck, could have imagined, Stefan Herheim serves up a frigid mess. Robin Ticciati's hypersensitive conducting and a compelling new Mélisande can't save it.No doubt one could intellectualise the basic ideas in this nasty piece of metatheatre - seeing and blindness, light and dark, a rigid old society oppressing the young - all of which are there to be sought out in Debussy and Maeterlinck. But there's an immediate disjunction here between designer Philipp Fürhofer's recreation of the Organ Room at Glyndebourne, with the King of Instruments opening out to a forest of crown-topped pipes, and the extremely stylised action within it (pictured below, Karen Cargill as Geneviève, Christina Gansch as Mélisande and John Chest as Pelléas). We start at one possible end - the dead Pelléas on a sarcophagus which will serve as a well and, sinking down, a pool around which very constricted scenes are acted out. Then, on official curtain-rise, comes the discovery of Mélisande, recreating a symbolist painting, by the widowed and deeply unattractive Golaud (Christopher Purves) in plus-fours and straggly beard. Herheim seems determined to have everything that happens in Debussy's fluid development of the drama take place too soon or at a different point to where the music says it should. So Golaud is physically violent with Mélisande long before his jealousy begins with the discovery that her wedding ring is missing. The young people whose love should develop so cautiously come too close too soon; Mélisande lets her hair down, but later than expected, and not from a high place (remember Vick's Christiane Oelze on the deco light-fitting? Here it's Golaud who's at the organ console, always watching). The regressive step of having a woman en travesti rather than a boy treble as Golaud's young son Yniold seems to be there so that ""he"" can transform into another long-haired Mélisande, but there is no terror or tension in the scene where the father tries to get the boy to spy on his wife and half-brother.That makes it tough on Ticciati, who wins wonderful balances and clear lower lines from the London Philharmonic Orchestra, but can't generate the necessary heat when the singers are not engaged in the musical drama too. When the production is still, you register the extreme refinements of the score, as in the exquisitely nuanced scene within the sea-cave (feeble lighting effects on the organ are as near as we get to nature-evocation). Blame Herheim for Purves turning in the only unconvincing performance I've ever witnessed him give; one doesn't give a damn about this tormented and tormenting soul (and from the start the French isn't good). John Chest's Pélleas seems right until he comes to the crucial high-lying raptures of what should be an extended love scene, where the baritone cracks (this either needs to be the very specific high French type, or a tenor with a convincing lower register). Gansch's Mélisande, though, would be ideal in a more human production - strange but not fey, passionate when needed. On the first night, deluded patriarch Arkel was sung with a little too much stentorian emphasis by Richard Wiegold from a box while Brindley Sherratt, suffering from a throat infection, acted out the role. Karen Cargill's lustrous mezzo-contralto is wasted on Geneviève, though she's always a presence, even when having to participate in the slightly risible communal dumb-shows that bedevil the later scenes. Chloé Briot (pictured above with Purves), the only French member of the cast, brings the scene where Yniold sees the symbolic sheep going off to the slaughter closest to real emotion. But as the action moves on, a slightly inebriated post-picnic audience is more liable to giggle at some of Herheim's more ineptly realised ideas, including Christ as good shepherd appearing in front of the organ console when Arkel sings of Mélisande as possible redeemer - the only second-half reference to the painting metaphor which adds an extra layer of confusion to the first with its empty easels. The final tableau, with Glyndebourne punters clutching programmes entering to look around the historic room, brought titters which shattered the hypnotic magic of Debussy's last bars.The ultimate problem is not only that Herheim doesn't know when to let a clever idea go, having made its point, but that he only half-tells it. It's like seeing a play or opera in a foreign language without supertitles where you only get glimpses of what it's all about. And that's a level of mystery very different from Debussy's or Materlinck's. First-time viewers must have been even more baffled.Add to that the fact that Vick's Glyndebourne Pelléas, perhaps the most hauntingly beautiful production ever seen there and designed by the late, lamented Paul Brown, also started out inside a claustrophobic mansion but suggested the scenes elsewhere far more effectively, and this has to be one of the biggest let-downs the country opera house has witnessed. The more so since European flavour-of-the-month Herheim flew into Glyndebourne on the wings of great expectations. Fortunately his Tchaikovsky Queen of Spades, seen in Amsterdam and heading to Covent Garden soon, is a much more convincingly worked-through concept. As for this one, perhaps wait until the Proms performance, where you may get some of the baffling physical gestures but not the distraction of the visual mésalliance.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/pell%C3%A9as-et-m%C3%A9lisande-glyndebourne-review-frigid-metatheatre,3
13,"The Turn of the Screw, ENO, Regent's Park Open Air Theatre review - one dimension, not four",The Turn of the Screw,ENO,2018-06-26,David Nice,"Opera and music theatre have set the birds shrilling in Regent's Park before in the shape of Gershwin's Porgy and Bess – a very forgettable production – and Sondheim's Into the Woods – much better, and a score which can give any 20th century opera a run for its money in terms of thematic interconnection. Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream would have been the obvious candidate; its earlier, tauter, smaller-scale companion-piece in terms of a very English haunting, The Turn of the Screw, was the more problematic choice for the Open Air Theatre's first collaboration with English National Opera in summer exile from the London Coliseum.It could have been a lot spookier if the ghosts of Bly – possibly a figment of the overwrought Governess's imagination in Henry James's ever-fascinating novella, given voices in Myfanwy Piper's occasionally infelicitous libretto for Britten – had kept their distance. How eerie they looked across the reed beds behind the decayed greenhouse-manor of Soutra Gilmour's splendid designs, but they never got to sing from there; how all too corporeal they were, complete with whiteface make-up, moving behind (craned necks from the spectators) and between the audience. No doubt their former selves, the valet Peter Quint and the previous governess Miss Jessel, had been up to no good with the children (Elen Willmer and Daniel Alexander Sidhom, pictured below) – very bad, in fact, though what exactly is never made explicit by James – but there still needs to be a layer of ambiguity about how they enter into the inexperienced new Governess's mind, hungry as she seems to be for Gothick romance. A subtle production can still just about keep this element in play, but Timothy Sheader's one-dimensional rendering wasn't it. The often unsatisfactory amplification would have allowed the ghosts to be heard from the distance they rarely kept. Could the opera have done without it had the excellent 13-piece ENO ensemble under company-trained conductor Toby Purser been in a kind of pit in front of the action rather than tucked away in the house behind it, like ghost inhabitants themselves in the first half, but again all too visible beneath ceiling lamps once it got darker, as if they were giving a country-house concert? With players as good as these, and the incredible solos Britten gives to each and every one of them, a flattening of timbre in the miking was inexcusable. Some, like the horn, could sound too boomy; others – the crucial piano – were barely audible at times. Still, the co-ordination was better than it had a right to be under the circumstances.Two casts are alternating, so you may have, or have had (press night was the fourth performance of nine), a very different experience from yesterday evening's. I somehow doubt that Sheader's approach would allow much more dramatic range than Anita Watson's Governess provided. Hers is a gorgeous, liquid lyric soprano, with or without amplification, and the early stages showed so much promise, Purser giving Watson plenty of space to float her doubts and raptures. But though her over-reactions to the narrative of housekeeper Mrs Grose (Janis Kelly, focused and perfect as far as the role allows) over past events and to the children's behaviour flashed warning signals, the sense of her being possessed in the drive for possession never quite emerged in the second act. Put that down to unhelpfully diffuse staging of the scenes where she pushed young Miles to the brink of confession. Even the final gesture was puzzling: why evade the obvious fade-out on the stricken women cradling – spoiler alert – the body of the dead boy with nothing better than her move down the walkway to crumple right in front of the audience? The tenors alternate roles. Last night William Morgan delivered the Prologue crisply, starting in the stalls, but without the close fusion needed with the distant piano, and Elgan Llŷr Thomas sang elegantly, but without the other-worldliness needed for the ""depraved"" Quint (the make-up and a bad red beard didn't help). More charismatic, Elin Pritchard's Miss Jessel set up the grand-opera duel with the present Governess in the schoolroom superbly (pictured above), but was again hampered by closeness to the audience. Sterling work from the two children, here Daniel Alexander Sidhom and Elen Wilmer, left some room for doubt over what they knew and saw, but it seemed as if Sheader couldn't quite make up his mind over that one, with a bit of overplaying the hand in what should be the night scene that ends Act One.On the plus side in the space's mixed blessings were fabulous improvised avian obbligatos throughout Act One: parakeets squawking warnings, the cawing of a crow, a blackbird striking up to Quint's arabesques – I assume not a pre-recorded one, though it was right next to a microphone. And when the Governess sang, in the most concordant scene of the opera to our setting, how ""the birds fly home to those great trees,"" they duly obliged. Drawbacks were havoc with the atmosphere of night and day scenes, for all the excellence of Jon Clark's lighting, and too great an awareness of one's fellow audience members. A perfect midsummer evening's pleasure, then, but no flesh creep.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/turn-screw-eno-regents-park-open-air-theatre-review-one-dimension-not-four,3
14,"Partenope, Iford Arts review - a midsummer night's dream of a Handel comedy",Partenope,Iford Arts,2018-06-26,alexandra Coghlan,"Rejected by London’s Royal Academy of Music in 1726 on grounds of frivolity, Partenope is the ultimate Handelian rom-com – a comedy whose intriguing is carried out with a smile, a swagger and a sparkle in the eye. But what raised eyebrows in the 18th century – unusually short arias, plenty of pacy recitative and an exuberant buffo spirit that constantly leaps out from behind the elegant classical pillars of opera seria – raises hopes and glasses in the 21st. Light on its dramatic feet, with a deliciously assured heroine at its centre, the work is the perfect stuff of summer opera.And if there’s a more perfect setting for that summer opera than Harold Peto’s Italianate gardens and cloister at Iford Manor it’s hard to imagine. Which makes it all the more heartbreaking that this season will be the festival’s last in this venue, although it plans to continue in a new home next year. So if you’ve been putting Iford off until “next year” this really is the time to go try out this smallest and most enchanting of the English opera festivals.In a crowded market (particularly crowded this year with Handel, with the Grange Festival currently staging Agrippina and Glyndebourne’s double offering of Giulio Cesare and Saul), Iford’s USP is not just its setting but its young casts, and there’s a real sense of energy and gung-ho abandon to Christopher Cowell’s Partenope. Sung in a new English translation by Cowell himself – a little uneven in tone, at its best in the snappy, throwaway felicities of the recitative – the work has an easy directness and plenty of much-needed pace, thanks to some judicious cuts.Love has rarely been as light-hearted a battlefield as among Partenope’s three suitors (four, if you count the cross-dressed Rosmira, who must play the suitor while secretly hoping to win back her own errant lover, Arsace). Cowell and designer Holly Pigott recognise this, bringing plenty of colour and silliness to a production that ends with Cupid – a cut-price deus ex Matalan complete with plastic wings and a natty white suit – firing his love-darts into all concerned to bring about a happy ending.Classical Naples here becomes an Eastern or African banana republic in the 1980s. Iford’s cloister is reimagined as the gaudy, palm-and-chandeliers palace of Partenope – a monarch whose taste in men is as questionable as her fondness for big hair, stretch pants and hot pinks. Less a concept than a style choice, whose visual references are magpie-many and only loosely literal (Emilio’s rival troops, pictured above with Jorge Navarro-Colorado as Emilio, are kitted out as Mohawk-sporting punks and goths, while Partenope’s troops fight with swords in what looks a lot like Edwardian military dress), the production is better simply enjoyed moment-to-moment than mined for any coherent insight – a sharp kick from Partenope’s leopard-print stilettos could send it tumbling.A young cast is led by Galina Averina’s sparky Partenope (pictured above with Beth Margaret Taylor as Rosmira), who captures the queen’s kittenish charm, though not perhaps her emotional stature. Crisply efficient coloratura dispatches “L’amor ed il destin” convincingly, and there’s an unexpectedly minxy quality to the lilting dance “Qual farfalletta” that works well. There’s perhaps a little too much acid for comfort in the tone of Alexander Simpson’s Arsace, but the countertenor pulls off the contrasting demands of the explosive “Furibondo spira il vento” and the breathtaking ballad “Ch’io parta” convincingly, the latter giving just a hint of a truer, less worked voice, beneath the various dramatic effects.Tom Scott-Cowell gives us creamier countertenor tone as Armindo, tenor Jorge Navarro-Colorado makes much of Emilio’s arias and promising mezzo Beth Margaret Taylor is a strong presence both dramatically and musically as the wronged Rosmira. All are sympathetically supported by conductor Christopher Bucknall and his stylish ensemble Contraband (complete, rather wonderfully in this small space, with horn and trumpet), who kept us dancing to Partenope’s tune from start to finish.@AlexaCoghlan",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/partenope-iford-arts-review-midsummer-nights-dream-handel-comedy,4
15,"La Traviata, Longborough Festival review - muddled director, vocal mixed bag",La Traviata,Longborough Festival,2018-06-25,stephen Walsh,"One wearies of quarrelling with opera directors’ concepts. But what’s the alternative? To ignore or acquiesce in crude, approximate reimaginings that, like Daisy Evans's new La Traviata at Longborough, stuff a work any old how into some snappy, after-dinner parody that says nothing useful about the piece, vulgarises the situations and confuses or misrepresents the text. Evans’s Violetta is the star of a film about Marie Antoinette. Marie who? Not Duplessis, evidently, Dumas’s own lady of the camellias. A hint at the eighteenth-century costuming of the original 1853 production? Hardly: that was “circa 1700.” Perhaps they’ll guillotine Violetta in the end. No such luck. She dies here, like all miserable film stars, from a drug overdose, with the poor French queen long abandoned. But wait: what about Alfredo’s poor sister back in Provence? Where? Surely we’re in Hollywood. Well, it’s true non-Italophone audience-members won’t get that detail, evaded by the surtitles, but it’s still there in the sung text. You see, the sister’s fiancé is refusing to marry her because of her brother’s irregular life-style. Oh, come on, pull the other leg! In modern Hollywood? No, in 1850s Provence. Are you saying Alfredo’s dad has come all the way from Provence to rescue Alfredo from the #MeToo brigade? Why not send an email? Don’t be silly, that would ruin Act 2. So, does the film get made? No, it seems to get forgotten, except that it’s not quite clear whether all the shenanigans about Alfredo’s sister and Flora’s party is part of a film or part of life. There are still spotlights and a film crew all over the place in Loren Elstein’s sets, and Violetta’s country house looks like a Potemkin beach hut, with a front and no back. OK, but at least you get that wonderful music. Yes, well, nearly all of it. Evans seems not to like the last few bars, so she trims them a touch, and when Violetta sings the bit about feeling better then drops dead, the others are so upset that they forget to sing their own lines. Not that it matters, since the director has cleverly placed the death scene downstage next to the proscenium arch where a lot of the stalls audience have to crane  see it.But there must have been compensations. Yes: one big one for a start. Claire Egan, a young New Zealand soprano out of the Cardiff Academy of Voice, is a talented singer we’ll be hearing a good deal more of (though here acting as cover for Anna Patalong, who sings most of the run). Egan has vocal brilliance and a strong stage presence and knows how to move. Not only was her first act aria done with real style and mature control (despite Daisy Evans having her distractingly, and very uncanonically, screwed by Alfredo on the film set during verse two of “Sempre libera”), but she held the empty stage alone in a beautiful account of “Addio del passato” at the start of Act 3. She was also the only lead singer on this first night who handled the small Longborough house with some sense of its intimacy. Peter Gijsbertsen (pictured above) tended to oversing early on and had momentary troubles in Act 2: a nice singer with a shade too much of the I-am-an-Italian-tenor. Good, though, in the emotionally violent third act, which also showed what Evans can do when she forgets concept and concentrates on the musical dramaturgy. The ensemble singing and dancing in this scene were excellent, with two or three lively cameo performances (Samantha Price as Flora, Aled Hall, who had, and gave us, fun with his camped up Gaston, Eddie Wade as a sturdy, bespectacled Douphol).The weak link vocally is Mark Stone’s Germont père, too big for the house and often giving the impression of being barked out over the orchestra, too much volume, not enough lyrical line and even, at times, very questionable intonation. His great scene with Violetta isn’t helped by the cramped, flat-front staging, but needs above all a more tender approach to Verdi’s wonderfully sensitive word-setting. La Traviata was not just new in its contemporary setting; it was radically new in the intimacy and precision of its psychology. It’s an opportunity, but also a challenge.Thomas Blunt conducts, tactfully if not always tidily. He could rope in some of the indiscipline in the singing. Alas there’s not much he can do about the concept.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-traviata-longborough-festival-review-muddled-director-vocal-mixed-bag,3
16,"The Abduction from the Seraglio, The Grange Festival review - enjoyable if conventional production",The Abduction from the Seraglio,The Grange Festival,2018-06-25,Bernard Hughes,"Just as the Last Night of the Proms is an end-of-term party with a concert tacked on, The Grange Festival (like other similar venues) offers a massive picnic interspersed with some opera. Unlike the Proms, however, where anyone can get in wearing anything they like for just £6, the English country house opera is the preserve of the well-heeled and genteel dressed in their finery, sipping expensive drinks.But as well as being socially elite, there is also a more admirable tradition of artistic elitism at these summer festivals, where top directors and singers do often fine work for the enjoyment of their well-fed audience. Grange’s new production of The Abduction from the Seraglio, by the veteran director John Copley, was one such enjoyable evening, albeit in a very traditional vein.Mozart’s opera was in some respects his breakthrough work, a Singspiel, in German with spoken dialogue. The decision here to sing (and speak) in English was a wise one, and helped chart a path through the sometimes convoluted plot.It took a little while to warm up, after a disappointingly flat overture. Jonathan Lemalu (pictured above by Simon Annand) as Osmin soon got things moving in his Act 1 arias, although there is to modern sensibilities a troubling Orientalism about the dramatic portrayal of this character. Lemalu offered an appropriate pomposity and short-temper, but the constant carping on how ugly, old and stupid Osmin is could, in another production, have made him more sympathetic.All the five principals sang very well, although some of the acting was a bit overwrought. Ed Lyon’s Belmonte was urbane and adept in his set-piece aria. Paul Curievici (Pedrillo) was great vocally – nowhere more so than in the serenade aria of Act 3 – but could be a bit hammy. Kiandra Howarth (Konstanze, pictured below) had a technique equal to Mozart’s pyrotechnical demands, although her big voice was not always as subtle as it was athletic. There was perhaps more light and shade in Daisy Brown’s singing as Blonde, and the Blonde-Pedrillo relationship was more convincingly romantic than Konstanze-Belmonte. In the middle is the tricky, non-singing role of Pasha Selim, taken by Alexander Andreou. He has to do a lot of reacting to other people singing, and be both mercurial and regal. He was the solid centre of the piece and got the biggest laugh of the night.Musically the highlights were the ensembles, where Mozart’s dramatic and compositional gifts come together quite breathtakingly. The four lovers achieved energetic counterpoint in their quarrel and a lovely vocal blend in their reconciliation. The chorus is notably under-used by Mozart, appearing only twice, but sounded impressive.Tim Reed’s set was simple but did the job, not suggesting an exotic Turkey but something more European. The Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra was conducted by Jean-Luc Tingaud, who negotiated the many changes of character and tempo, and the orchestra was much better in the second half, where in the first there had been some co-ordination issues with the stage. Copley received a warm reception during the curtain calls. His difficulties early in the year do not seem to have diminished his appetite for creating new work at an age when I intend to be putting my feet up.Companies like the Grange Festival need to stay in the middle lane to continue to attract the audience they do: that is, one not especially interested in breaking new ground. But, unsubsidised as it is, with the show itself as a kind of loss-leader, Grange Park (like the other country houses) at least offers a future model for opera, even if it is older, whiter and more affluent than might be desirable.  ",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music-opera/abduction-seraglio-grange-festival-review-enjoyable-if-conventional-production,3
17,theartsdesk in Paris - following in the footsteps of Gounod,theartsdesk in Paris - following in the footsteps of Gounod,,2018-06-24,alexandra Coghlan,"It’s a truism that history is written by the victors, but nowhere in classical music is the argument made more persuasively than in the legacy and reputation of Charles Gounod. In a year in which you can hardly move for Bernstein and Debussy-related events, a year in which even Couperin and Parry are getting a good showing, as well as the too-often-neglected Lili Boulanger, the 200th anniversary of the composer’s birth is passing all but uncelebrated in the UK.It’s a sign of just how far out of fashion Gounod has fallen that none of the major British houses is taking the opportunity to stage one of his operas. A revival of David McVicar’s production of Faust at the Royal Opera next year feels like too little too late for one of the 19th century’s greats – a composer whose conservative style and reputation was swept aside in the all-consuming flood of Wagnerian innovation. Famous detractors (including Wagner himself, as well as Debussy) have done further damage, leaving Gounod’s reputation balanced precariously on little more than Faust, Romeo et Juliette and the ubiquitous ""Ave Maria"".But in the composer’s native France the anniversary is drawing more attention. Earlier this month, Gounod was the focus of the Palazetto Bru Zane’s annual Paris festival, showcased as a symphonist and composer of sacred music as well as for his operas. Inevitably, however, it’s the latter that dominated, with a rare staging of the composer’s notorious La Nonne Sanglante and the world premiere of a brand-new edition of Faust – the first chance to hear the work stripped of its now-traditional revisions and restored to the composer’s startlingly different first thoughts.It’s hard to walk through Paris and not find yourself treading in Gounod’s footsteps. The composer’s life criss-crossed the city for over 70 years, measured out in architectural milestones right across Paris. You can follow Gounod (pictured below) from his birth in the leafy Place Saint-Andre-des-Arts and the Paris Conservatoire, where he began his studies in 1836, to his adult home in the Rue Vaneau (where he was, incidentally, a neighbour of the young Karl Marx) to the Eglise des Missions Etrangeres with its elegant 17th century façade where he was organist, and the seminary of Saint Sulpice where the composer briefly studied theology and toyed with the idea of joining the priesthood.Perhaps most evocative, however, is the Rue d’Ankara, out in the smart 16th arrondissement in the western corner of the city, where “poor, mad Gounod” (as Berlioz described him) lived for a few weeks in a clinic as the patient of the famous Dr Emile Blanche. Mental instability dogged the composer throughout his life, manifesting itself in “cerebral fevers” that would force him to his bed, but would also, perhaps, become the source for the rich, complicated psychology of his operas – for Marguerite’s terrible, murderous confusion, and Sapho’s suicidal desperation.But it’s not the various apartments he occupied nor even this latter address, which framed his personal nadir, that tells us most about Gounod. He may have lived in addresses across the city, but his true homes were Paris’s opera house – the scenes of his greatest professional successes and personal triumphs as well as his most demoralising public failures.Faust was, of course, Gounod’s most famous triumph. Its performance at the Paris Opera in 1869 established the work’s reputation internationally, and for a long time it was the house’s most-performed opera. But the version the Parisian audience witnessed that night – the work we know today, complete with a ballet, sung recitatives and the now-traditional sequence of arias and ensembles – is a long way from the score premiered a decade earlier at the city’s Theatre Lyrique. That this earlier version was rejected by the Paris Opera tells you much about the light-footed 1859 account, an altogether more mercurial work than its later counterpart.Performed by Christophe Rousset and Les Talens Lyriques, this contemporary premiere of the “original” Faust is based on a new edition shortly to be published by Barenreiter. Paul Prevost (also editor of the 1869 Faust) has put together an unusual score that exposes the many layers of musical archaeology concealed beneath the surface of this familiar work. The edition allows performers to recreate the 1859 premiere but, perhaps more interestingly, it also enables them to create a variety of palimpsest versions of the score, incorporating the significant music excised before the premiere as well as that added inafterwards.The account we heard here at the Theatre des Champs-Elysees (soon also to be recorded and released by Les Talens Lyriques) was musical collage intended to offer the greatest amount of “new” music (including a duet for Marguerite and Valentin before the latter’s departure for war, an exquisite aria for Siebel, a light, characterful trio for Wagner, Siebel and Faust, and a slick new tavern song – “Maitre Scarabee” – for Mephistopheles) while still creating a satisfying dramatic and musical whole.But even more striking than the unfamiliar numbers (and the absence of some very familiar ones, such as Mephistopheles’s “Le Veau d’or” or Valentin’s “O saint medaille”) is the change in tone and pace generated by the return to the work’s original spoken dialogue, together with the melodramas that bridge the gap between these and the sung passages.Suddenly secondary figures like Dame Marthe come off the page, fleshed into real human detail and interest. The latter becomes a wonderfully garrulous, gossipy, ghastly old lady, whose attempted seduction of Mephistopheles offers brutally jagged counterpoint to Marguerite’s tragic loss of virtue. Wagner, Valentin and Siebel too are given new space and time dramatically, as well as new music. The result puts the tragic plot in fresh counterpoint and balance with comic sub-plot, creating not an opera demi-caractere. (Pictured above: Veronique Gens, who plays Marguerite)The change that really swings the balance, however, is the role of Mephistopheles, whose new dialogue (rich in knowing asides to the audience, wooing us along with Faust, implicating us at every step in his actions) helps shape a villain whose smooth, self-deprecating charm (truly a fantome adorable et charmant) is far more insidious a weapon than the blunt-force attacks of his later incarnation. A different tone requires a different voice, and from the sinister vocal smile of his opening “Me voici”, the casting of Andrew Foster-Williams here completed the transformation from a looming, booming bass-baritone to a singer closer to a baryton de caractère – lighter and more nimble vocally, more playful in his characterisation and treatment of text.The necessary counterweight to so much lightness was Veronique Gens’s Marguerite. No empty-headed virgin, this heroine had a stature – both vocally and dramatically – that rooted the drama in tragedy, that kept it from straying from the very real moral dilemma at the heart of the piece. Matching the grainy textural details of Rousset’s period orchestra, Gens gave us the innocence of stern moral conviction rather than of foolish incomprehension. Her Jewel Song (which, in this edition, gains some 30 bars) had real wonder to it, born out of text cherished and handled with such vocal care, but it was in the later Acts that she really came into the own – in the horrified realisation of “Il ne revient pas” (its pathos spiced by the reinstatement of Siebel’s tender answering romance “Versez vos chagrins dans mon ame”) and the cruel drama of the church scene.Playing the straight man to Foster-Williams’s comic devil, Benjamin Bernheim’s Faust is less world-weary than most. Easy and unstrained right to the top of the voice, Bernheim’s lovely instrument spun Faust’s “Salut, demeure chaste et pure” from beaten gold – airy and glowing from within – draping Les Talens Lyriques’ translucent accompaniment in the finest of melodic cloths.But if individual voices helped (re-)animate this 1859 Faust, the heart of this newly restored work was the orchestra. It’s as though Gounod’s heavy, magnificent Romantic opera has been scrubbed and stripped back to the white wood hidden beneath many years of stain and varnish. The work’s structural silhouette may still be sprawling and weighty, but its impression is one of new elegance, its musical pleasantly mottled with light and shade. Rousset’s 19th century brass add their rough, whooping shouts to the military episodes, while the jangling period harp is altogether more volatile than its contemporary counterpart – offering a fragile, uncertain vision of beauty and love. Above all, the strings – sinewy, lean, deft – allow us the opportunity to hear all of this detail, never smothering or dulling Gounod’s skilful orchestration.Where Faust gave us an unfamiliar perspective on familiar Gounod, a fully staged production of the composer’s La Nonne Sanglante at Paris’s Opera Comique (a co-production with Laurence Equilbey and her Insula orchestra and the Palazetto Bru Zane) offered us classic Gounod style in a thrillingly unfamiliar work. Rarely performed owing to the unremitting musical challenges of its central tenor, an under-written soprano lead and a libretto that creaks and howls more vividly than any Gothic ghouls in the attic, La Nonne Sanglante is nevertheless a startlingly good score. Infighting and regime-change at the Paris Opera saw it decried as “filth”, condemning its future in the repertoire, but this had less to do with the work itself and more to do with operatic politicking. (Pictured above: Michael Spyres with Vannina Santoni as Agnes and Marion Lebegue as La Nonne) A five-act behemoth that should collapse under its own weight and the kitsch excesses of a plot based on Matthew Lewis’s deliciously lurid novel The Monk is sustained by sheer musical invention. Both the orchestration and the melodic writing of this early work (premiered some five years before Faust) are full of surprise and charm, whether in the sparky coloratura numbers for page-boy Arthur (a trouser role for soprano taken here with verve and precision by Jodie Devos), the breath-taking sequence of tenor arias for Rodolphe or the lowering clouds of low brass and chromatic lightning flashes that colour the music of the bleeding nun herself.This new production by David Bobee pulls off the feat of honouring the work’s Gothic milieu and mood while avoiding pantomime. Game of Thrones-style costuming nods to the story’s medieval setting but is briskly tempered by monochromes and minimalist design. The effect is a bit sci-fi and a bit Narnia – a dramatic backdrop just engaging enough to hold the attention while keeping the score in the spotlight, framing dancers and the chorus singers from Equilbey’s accentus choir in a sequence of memorable tableaux.You don’t stage La Nonne Sanglante unless you have a star tenor, and in Michael Spyres Equilbey and Bobee have that in spades – a once-in-a-generation voice that doesn’t just cope with but actively relishes the stratospheric tessitura and formidable technical demands of the role. With no arias assigned to his love-interest Agnes (soprano Vannina Santoni, silvery-strong in the duets), the tenor must carry the show, supported by colourful musical cameos from Pierre the Hermit, whose incense-perfumed music anticipates the spiritual episodes of Faust, and the Bleeding Nun herself. Mezzo Marion Lebegue found both the cruelty and the pain in a character who is at once victim and villain, opening up surprising psychological ambiguity in the piece, and adding another strong argument in its favour.Where Les Talens Lyriques gave us crisp clarity, Equilbey and Insula offered depth and richness, painting sonic slashes of red through Bobee’s monochromes, and balancing the heady brilliance and agility of Spyres’ tenor with meaty instrumental weight. This isn’t the lean, clean, classical Gounod of the 1859 Faust and it’s all the better for it.Two operas, two very different musical worlds, and one persistent question: when is the long-overdue Gounod revival going to get underway? Wagner may have had the last word, but France’s Romantic still has plenty to say. 200 years later maybe it’s about time we started listening.@AlexaCoghlan",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/theartsdesk-paris-following-footsteps-gounod,
18,"The Path to Heaven, RNCM, Manchester review - tragedy, truth, passion",The Path to Heaven,RNCM,2018-06-22,Robert Beale,"Adam Gorb’s The Path to Heaven, with libretto by Ben Kaye, is his longest work to date (almost two hours’ running time without interval) and on a story that could hardly be more tragic – the Holocaust. Its premiere at the Royal Northern College of Music was conducted by Mark Heron and given by members of Psappha with singers and musicians from the RNCM, directed by Stefan Janski.This was the culmination of a two-day festival of the music of Anthony Gilbert and Adam Gorb (pictured below), the first and present Heads of Composition of the RNCM respectively. It’s really a kind of opera documentary: Kaye has been Gorb’s collaborator on a number of previous projects, in particular Anya 17, their 2012 opera on human trafficking which could fairly claim to have helped change UK law, and the project has been one of passion and commitment from the start.They wanted to capture the reality of the experience of Holocaust survivors, of whom there are ever fewer still living, and their research gave birth to a storyline that is essentially true, albeit with some elements from different sources mixed together. Hanna and Sara are sisters who have been brought up by their aunt and uncle – Hanna has a baby, Sara a boyfriend called Dieter – and after a party for Sara’s 18th birthday they find they are to be rounded up and sent to camps, along with their cousin Magda, on account of their Jewish heritage.We follow their story as they go through the transit camp at Terezin and then to an extermination camp, where they suffer the horror of Uncle Rudi’s ""selections"" and the betrayals and merciless cruelty of the killing machine. Dieter, meanwhile, became a soldier and is made a guard at the same camp – he is able to get some fresh bread to Sara, and the denouement of the tale comes when Hanna steals a stale crust from another prisoner to save her baby. Sara says she was the thief and produces the fresh bread, thereby ensuring (since the complainant will prefer to get the fresh loaf ""back"" rather than what he really lost, and thus sustain her fiction) that she herself will be killed and her sister, the baby and Dieter may survive another day.It’s a terrible story, full of irony (Dieter’s attempt to help effectively signed Sara’s death warrant) and building to a dramatic high point. In the event, only Magda lives to tell the tale, but in face of this tragedy the opera has not just its moments of comedy but an optimistic ending, as Gorb underlines the fact that the sacrifice Sara made is what finally lives on, defeating all the Nazis’ intentions of destroying a people, its culture and its hope. In the end, though not overtly religious, it is a very faith-filled work.The opera is beautifully constructed, framed by a solo singer named Esther (Lorna Day), who sings a Hebrew lullaby. It was given in semi-staged form in the RNCM concert hall, no doubt a necessity for a big work with six other acting roles and 15 in the orchestra (12 wind and brass, piano and two percussion). But inevitably that meant limitations for the presentation of the story, although the singers and Janski’s direction made something amazing out of slim resources, and the on-stage band, despite the skill of Gorb’s word setting, was sometimes in danger of overwhelming the voices’ audibility (the text was printed in the programme booklet, which helped me, at any rate, keep up).If there is a downside to the conscientious accuracy of the text-writing of the piece, it lies in what seem at times to be verbatim transcriptions of the recollections of those who must now be elderly, recalling a long-ago childhood, as speeches in the present. The depth of the words and metaphors they use can hardly be absorbed in a single hearing … but then, no really great work can be taken in at one go, and this demands to be heard more than once.The music, though, is of extraordinary skill, passion and beauty. Gorb has written exhilaratingly in klezmer style on a number of occasions before, and he gets that vernacular into his score to splendid effect. He’s also a master of pastiche of what he calls ""bad music"" – slimy 1930s populist stuff – and even has a go at sending up a staid Lutheran chorale (I'm not quite sure what that symbolises in this context). Above all, he lets himself go with expressions of the horror and outrageousness of the truth he’s telling, and leaves you in no doubt about his feelings and his passion for a truth to be told.The acting singers – Lucy Vallis as Magda, who narrates much of the story, Fiona Finsbury as Hanna, Caroline Taylor as Sara, Michael Jones as Dieter (Taylor and Jones pictured above), and David Cane taking the two roles of Hans (the girls’ brother, met in the opening scene) and a mad rabbi in the later extermination camp episode, along with Einar Stefánsson in the equally repellent two roles of the ""selections"" camp doctor and a monster of a camp guard – were highly effective in character portrayal and excellent in sound.And the title? ""The path to heaven"" is a mocking phrase first used by the guards on a cattle-truck transit train taking the innocents to the slaughter: later it is used by Sara to express her sacrifice: “Sometimes the path to heaven can bestow strange, wonderful gifts.”@RobertBealeMcr",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/path-heaven-rncm-manchester-review-tragedy-truth-passion,4
19,"Kiss Me, Kate, Opera North, London Coliseum review - Cole Porter delivered in true company style",Kiss Me,Kate,2018-06-21,David Nice,"First palpable hit of the evening: a full orchestra in the pit under hyper-alert Opera North stalwart James Holmes, saxophones deliciously rampant. Second hit: they've got the miking of the voices right (very rare in West End shows). Third: the first ensemble number, ""Another opening, another show"", sends spirits soaring. What follows is very good, sometimes excellent, occasionally fresh and startling.Any sense of slight anticlimax may well the fault of a musical which, while stocked higher with hit songs than most (Cole Porter at his wickedly rhyming, melodically snaking best), has always struck me as something of a baggy monster. I'm always expecting more of a mesh between backstage badinage and the musicalised Taming of the Shrew served up in large chunks (what do you expect, devotees may well ask? It's Broadway, not Strauss/Hofmannsthal). That said, where illusion ends and a kind of reality begins is nicely underlined by Jo Davies’s nimble production, revived here by Ed Goggin, with Colin Richmond’s sets offering curtains to be fumbled with and sending flats whizzing, serving the Shakespeare with a Renaissance house full of familiar medieval tapestries (why not?) ironically counterpointing courtly love with the comic alternative (pictured below). Reprises and symmetries are neatly served, too. No-one lets the side down, but if there’s a quibble it might be over the absence of real Broadway charisma from the leads. What we get instead is numbers delivered with perfect operatic range, panache and breath control by Quirijn de Lang’s actor-director Fred/Petruchio and Stephanie Corley’s ex-wife lead Lilli/Kate (Corley sings Katya Kabanova at Opera North next season). De Lang’s dialogue occasionally has one switching off – in the scene where Petruchio shows Kate comestibles and luxuries before having them sent away, and in his outlining of the tedious time Lilli faces with her new husband-to-be – but the energy always goes up a notch in the numbers.Note-perfect in every way, though, are the music-theatre second couple, Zoe Rainey as Lois/Bianca and Alan Burkitt’s Bill/Lucentio (pictured below). Burkitt takes us by surprise when he breaks into impressive ballet – Will Tuckett’s choreography, revived here by David James Hulston – while Rainey saves the dizzy-blonde stereotype for the play-within-the-play and makes something more real out of Lois’s irresistible set pieces. So we’re happy to have a superlative delivery of “Always true to you in my fashion,” prefaced by unexpectedly touching solo strings, with the obligatory two “reprises” in the G&S Act Two tradition. That rather steals the thunder of the three stages for the two stooges in “Brush up your Shakespeare,” for all the funny business from Joseph Shovelton and John Savournin whose too-English delivery of the gangsters' lines earlier on makes the humour of their adaptation to Shakespeare less pronounced. They do the number to perfection, though.Strong cameos from Aiesha Pease, whose Hattie launches the musical numbers in style, Stephane Anelli giving a kick to “Too darn hot” and Claire Pascoe’s Stage Manager add to the pleasure. The dancers strut their stuff to perfection and what a joy it is to have the Opera North Chorus engaged so well again – another reminder that their less well-used counterparts in ENO would probably be on the Coliseum stage right now if it hadn’t been for the infamous Cressida Pollock’s decimation of their season. At least the London lot got their comic spotlight in ENO's terrific Iolanthe earlier this season. In spite of the bagginess here - something I don't find in G&S -  it's good to have all the music in the lustrous orchestrations of the master Robert Russell Bennett and Don Walker, lovingly restored by David Charles Abell. Opera North has got it consistently right over recent years, and this is a very colourful feather in the company's rainbow hat.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera-theatre/kiss-me-kate-opera-north-london-coliseum-review-cole-porter-delivered-true-company,4
20,"Falstaff, Garsington Opera review - Sir John under pressure",Falstaff,Garsington Opera,2018-06-18,Sebastian Scotney,"All those pranks, set-ups, fake letters and disguises, they just keep coming thick and fast in Verdi’s Falstaff. The score has irresistible energy and momentum. The composer made sure in his last opera that when the fantasies, schemes and hopes of Shakespeare's Sir John Falstaff are given apparent encouragement, only to be systematically unpicked and nixed, it all happens with allegro markings like vivace, brioso and brillante. And this was a musical performance led by Richard Farnes with exactly the right kind of verve about it.And yet the dreamy setting, the Wormsley estate where Garsington Opera has made its summer home for the past eight years, with its astonishing grounds and gardens, seems to impart an air of unreality, detachment, immateriality. It almost has its way of intruding on the unfolding story. I found my attention drawn by a vast elder bush to the left of the stage outside the opera pavilion, which just stands there and quivers in the summer wind, insouciant to the passions, machinations and frenetic action onstage.And talking of trees, where were they? It is probably pedantic and over-literal to mention it, but there is a scene where Verdi and librettist Boito specifically ask for them. They even say where on the stage they want them: “in the middle of the stage with Ford’s house to the left”. Garsington’s production directed by Bruno Ravella has not just teleported the action of Falstaff from the reign of (the English) Henry IV into the early 20th century, and the period of the suffragettes. It has transplanted that particular domestic scene (Act 1 Scene 2), and jollied it up by setting it on the concourse of a station, complete with a puffing steam locomotive, which duly received its own round of applause (pictured below, Hollie-Anne Bangham (chorus) Victoria Simmonds, Yvonne Howard, Soraya Mafi, Mary Dunleavy). What does the updating achieve? The main answer is to reinforce and semaphore the implicit message that it is the women in the story whose will is going to prevail. That’s no bad thing, but Falstaff risks not being just a figure of fun; both the updating and the stage business point a more constant wagging and accusing finger at him. This Falstaff is not just a fantasist, but an abuser of women.Bass-baritone Henry Waddington (pictured below) was making his debut in the role. Surrounded by stalwarts of the UK opera scene, formidable character actors such as Yvonne Howard in the role of Mistress Quickly or Adrian Thompson as Bardolfo, I thought he was simply outgunned on this opening night. As Geraint Evans once told a young Bryn Terfel, “presence on the stage has to be something that holds the eye of whoever is spending their hard-earned cash to see you.” For presence also read swagger. Is Henry Waddington capable of that? Yes, and as the run progresses he is bound to put his own stamp on this role more than he did on Saturday. The other principals were excellent. The crispest enunciation, the best Italian and huge rhythmic positivity was coming from Richard Burkhard in the role of Ford. Mary Dunleavy as Alice and Victoria Simmons as Meg were both well-drawn characters. The young lovers Nanetta and Fenton both shone as performed by Soraya Mafi and Oliver Johnston, and Colin Judson was a highly memorable Dr Caius. Richard Farnes conducted the Philharmonia Orchestra with real clarity and purpose. To my ears there was complete unanimity between stage and pit until one swiftly righted section in Act 3. Given the pace of the piece, that is no mean achievement for an opening night. And the wind principals of the  Philharmonia really are a top-flight crew, notably Jill Crowther on cor anglais and, when the horn comes into its own in the final act, Nigel Black. The chorus directed by Susanna Stranders proved what a force for good they are in the final scene. The designs by Giles Cadle and the lighting by Malcolm Rippeth, particularly for the final scene in Windsor Forest, were delightful.  This is a thoroughly professional and well-executed Falstaff. And it has been a fascinating idea to juxtapose it for this thirtieth season at Garsington Opera with two other composers’ last works for the opera stage, Mozart's Die Zauberflöte and Strauss's Capriccio.@sebscotney",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/falstaff-garsington-opera-review-sir-john-under-pressure,3
21,"Berlin to Broadway with Kurt Weill, Opera North, City Varieties Music Hall review - life as a cabaret",Berlin to Broadway with Kurt Weill,Opera North,2018-06-18,graham Rickson,"Peer at the small print and it’s clear that Berlin to Broadway with Kurt Weill is actually a spruced-up repackaging of a show originally devised by Gene Lerner and arranger Newton Wayland, about whom Opera North’s programme tells us nothing. The cabaret-style production’s two halves take us neatly through Weill’s career, the linking narrative divvied out among the 11-strong cast in a manner that suggests a primary school class assembly.But it works handsomely. Veteran director Giles Havergal’s hands-off approach would surely have pleased Weill’s testy collaborator Brecht. And having the songs accompanied, superbly, by Martin Pickard on piano means that we hear more, not less. The cast, mostly drawn from Opera North’s chorus, are in evening dress throughout, assisted intermittently by hats, props and chairs. Leeds’ intimate City Varieties makes for an ideal venue: this production would feel lost in a larger space.The first act’s Berlin sequence includes all the hits you’d expect: pin-sharp English versions of “The Ballad of Mack the Knife”, the “Alabama Song” and “Pirate Jenny”, and a startling sextet performance of the “Benares Song” from Mahagonny, Weill’s sleazy harmonies really hitting home. Delivery is never too operatic, except, rightly so, in Lorna James and Nicholas Watt’s exquisite German rendition of the “Duet of the Cranes”, again from Mahagonny. I’d not heard all of these translations before, my favourite being a revamped “Cannon Song” (“Let’s all go barmy/And join the army/We chop ‘em to bits because we like our hamburgers raw”), spat out with fury by Alex Banfield and Richard Mosely-Evans (pictured below). The meteoric rise and fall of the Brecht/Weill partnership is succinctly outlined, the near-catastrophic premiere of The Threepenny Opera a highlight. The songs, however, do begin to blur into one another without a linking plot, and Weill’s stylistic tropes begin to grate when they’re heard without much of a gap.Thus it’s a relief to cross the Atlantic for the second half, picking up the story of Weill and his on/off spouse Lotte Lenya after they had left Nazi Germany. Weill loved his new home, renouncing his European origins (“I am an American composer.”) and embracing Broadway musical theatre. Yet listen carefully and you can still hear the gears grinding away beneath the music’s gleaming surfaces: the best of Weill’s American numbers have a rawness and poignancy that really hit home. Dean Robinson throws in a lovely rendition of Knickerbocker Holiday’s “September Song”, and Watts’s account of “Johnny’s Song” from the long-forgotten Johnny Johnson brings tears to the eyes. Funniest is “The Saga of Jenny” from the 1941 psychoanalytical musical Lady in the Dark. Ira Gershwin’s lyrics are superb, and Amy Freston savours every syllable.Weill became an American citizen, only to suffer a near-terminal setback when his and Gershwin’s 1945 show The Firebrand of Florence proved to be an expensive flop. He attempted to write a popular opera (1947’s Street Scene), and later teamed up with Alan Jay Lerner. The title number from Weill’s final musical Lost in the Stars is handsomely delivered by bass Gordon D Shaw and the ensemble, but it’s too syrupy for comfort. Death came in 1950 as he was working on a musical adaptation of Huckleberry Finn, for which five numbers survive. We don’t hear any of them here, ending instead with powerful ensemble renditions of “What Keeps a Man Alive” and “Mack the Knife” – an ironic reminder that this composer’s biggest American hit was a posthumous revival of The Threepenny Opera.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music-opera/berlin-broadway-kurt-weill-opera-north-city-varieties-music-hall-review-life,4
22,"Mamzer Bastard, Royal Opera, Hackney Empire review - inert Hasidic music-drama",Mamzer Bastard,Royal Opera,2018-06-15,David Nice,"Striking it lucky with a successful new opera is a rare occurrence, though every company has a duty to keep on trying. The Royal Opera hit the jackpot with 4.48 Psychosis, a highly original approach to Sarah Kane's profound and authentic play by Philip Venables, the first Doctoral Composer-in-Residence on the scheme initiated by Covent Garden in alliance with the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. How could one not wish his successor, Israel-born Na'ama Zisser, all the best? Her credentials are excellent, not least studies with Mark-Anthony Turnage. But Mamzer Bastard makes for a nearly unendurable 90 minutes in which a churning orchestral sludge seems misallied with operatic word-setting of an awkwardness unparalleled even by today's mostly ungainly standards.Relatively bearable is the cantorial music framing the action, mostly by other composers – only the last of the seven numbers is by Zisser, and you can guess without having read the programme beforehand since it's much more awkward for the excellent tenor Netanel Hershtik, cantor of The Hampton Synagogue, New York (pictured right), to negotiate. More surprising to read is that Zisser hoped for homogeneity between the religious numbers and her own music-theatre; the contrasts are extreme, and make what in the context of the synagogue might be fitting seem mostly banal.The plot, such as it is, underlines with very little tension the heavily signposted revelation. On the eve of his traditional Hasidic wedding, Joel finds that he is indeed his mother's son, but not by his presumed father; the “Stranger” who dogs him is her first husband, presumed dead in the camps (no spoiler there), after whom he's named. That makes Joel the younger not so much a bastard as a “mamzer,” illegitimate in the eyes of Jewish custom because the mother has been married to another man. The drama supposedly unfolds on the streets of New York during the blackout of 13 July 1977.Though this is clearly Joel the younger’s crisis, you'd think it was Apocalypse Now on the streets of New York rather than a matter of personal revelation, the sort of doomy nightmare where you're wading through treacle. The mostly lower-register instruments sink ever downwards in a style which seems at loggerheads with the jerky setting of repetitious text (by Zisser's sister Rachel and Samantha Newton). Whether conductor Jessica Cottis is getting tight results from the Aurora Orchestra ensemble or not is impossible to judge – as is the vocal quality of the five singers actually participating in the drama. Treble Edward Hyde as young Joel, countertenor Collin Shay as his older self, Gundula Hintz, Robert Burt and Steven Page can't be judged by the same standards that make Hershtik's part in the proceedings more accountable. The ungainly lines are further sabotaged by raspy-edged miking (really necessary against 10 instrumentalists?). The camera held by video designer Pauline Jurzec projecting enlarged images on to a screen – a cliché now in all but the best hands: director Ivo van Hove can still get away with it; Jay Scheib, in charge here, does not – has the further drawback of the lips moving out of synch with the delivery.The possibility of grace after all this torment (Hintz and Shay pictured above) could just about be considered moving in itself, but the real balm comes in a final release from the harsh lights and the monotonous sound pictures. A worthy subject, no doubt, but nothing in its handling inspires confidence in the possibility of future work from this team.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/mamzer-bastard-royal-opera-hackney-empire-review-inert-hasidic-music-drama,1
23,"Acis and Galatea, English National Opera, Lilian Baylis House review - Handel for the hashtag generation",Acis and Galatea,English National Opera,2018-06-12,alexandra Coghlan,"If you go to ENO’s Acis and Galatea expecting a grassy knoll draped decoratively with a Watteau shepherdess or two then you may be disappointed. Launched in 2017, the company’s reliably punchy Studio Live strand (stripped-back, small-scale, off-site performances) continues here with Handel’s “little opera”, reinvented for the Instagram age. #Nymphsandshepherds #FlockthisBeanbags (candy-bright) are strewn across the turf (astro), bathed in the glow of the vending machines ranked across the back of the stage. “Work Hard, Play Harder” enjoins a balloon sign, while arrows point the way to “Groves of Delights and Crystal Fountains”. Welcome to the festival-themed office party of Mountain Media, a Shoreditch-fabulous social media firm, whose employees’ idea of a good time perhaps inevitably involves Hawaiian shirts, selfies (shared on the video screens that flank the stage) and plenty of booze.Designer Justin Nardella may be both young and hip, but his set sadly is anything but. From its strenuous neons to its inflatable unicorn and primitive digital elements, the whole effect is effortful – of youth culture with its filter set to “middle-aged”. The same feels true of director Sarah Tipple’s concept itself, whose closing twist (no spoilers here) seems wilfully to misunderstand the evanescence of social media – trying for Dave Eggers’ The Circle but not quite landing the final satirical blow. Have “the young” ever been seduced by an art form aping their world, or would they rather be drawn into another? I’m not advocating prim 18th century traditionalism, simply for a concept that doesn’t beg quite so cravenly for approval, that doesn’t try and stuff a cumbersome analogue original into a slinky new digital frame and call it current.The decision to stage the performance in the traverse is also a baffling one, placing the audience in awkward proximity to ENO’s Coliseum-calibrated chorus and leading to an uncomfortable stereo effect with the orchestral sound coming from one side and the singers from the other. The small theatre at Lilian Baylis House would have yielded ample musical intimacy in a more conventional setup, giving both audience and performers a more satisfactory, if less buzzwordily “immersive” experience.Nicholas Ansdell-Evans conducts a deft, unfussy account of Handel’s original, two-act score with a fine, eight-strong band drawn from the ENO Orchestra (including two recorders, who thrive in this intimate space) and a rather larger chorus. Shorn without obvious dramatic loss of one shepherd (Coridon, whose delicious “Would you gain the tender creature” is reassigned to Acis’s sidekick Damon), the cast is a lean, youthful affair. Alexander Sprague’s nicely blady tenor (at its best in the faux-military swagger of “Love sounds th’alarm”) gives this preening, petulant Acis (pictured above with Lucy Hall as Galatea) some heroic aspiration, with Bradley Smith – softly grainy and characterful as a wooden flute – a fine musical foil as sweet-but-dim Damon.Lucy Hall’s Galatea spins Handel’s “Heart the seat of soft delight” (whose text makes little sense in the context of this rewritten ending) into softest whorls of melody, and tempers the nymph’s gentleness with plenty of dramatic spirit, but Matthew Durkan’s warmly sung, personable Polyphemus (pictured above, no cyclops here, just another colleague) becomes sympathetic to a problematic degree – the victim of cyber and workplace bullying rather than the monster-murderer Handel paints so coolly.A masque with pretensions, Acis and Galatea is as slight as staged Handel gets – an attractive score in search of a plot. The trouble with Tipple’s production is that it forces the audience to take it seriously. Murder among giants and nymphs is one thing, especially when the victim can be speedily and conveniently immortalised as a fountain, but a dead body at an office party is quite another. #buzzkill",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/acis-and-galatea-english-national-opera-lilian-baylis-house-review-handel-hashtag-generation,3
24,"Roscoe, BBC Philharmonic, Mena, Bridgewater Hall, Manchester review - a scenic send-off",Roscoe,BBC Philharmonic,2018-06-12,Robert Beale,"Juanjo Mena, chief conductor of Manchester's BBC Philharmonic for the past seven years, took his official leave of them with a programme reflecting his great love, the music of his Spanish homeland. Albéniz and Falla, to be precise, and the greater part was a complete concert performance of the latter’s opera La Vida Breve. A quality list of Spanish singers had been engaged – notable among them Nancy Fabiola Herrera, as Salud – along with the Spanish Radio and TV Chorus, Coro RTVE.So there was a festive feeling in the air from the outset: the concert was to be a celebration of a warm relationship and remarkable achievement. The BBC Philharmonic has given a response to Mena that has been appreciative from the start (he came to them after Yan Pascal Tortelier and Gianandrea Noseda, and never tried to uproot their style or fashion a make-over), and he has given them the freedom to enjoy their music-making at every level. Put simply, he has infectious rhythm and soaring melody in his soul, and it has shown in their playing.Albéniz’ overture to The Magic Opal, an operetta, may not be the greatest piece the composer wrote (or even the most characteristically Spanish), but it’s full of brightness, theatrical in flavour and largely based on one big up-and-down leaping tune. Mena and the BBC Phil (led by Zoe Beyers) devoted as much care to it as any weightier piece, and, despite only a 40-string ensemble (later to be enlarged), it came over with sumptuous sound and self-effacing wind contributions.Martin Roscoe (pictured left by Eric Richmond) was the piano soloist in Albéniz’ Rapsodia Española, in George Enescu’s orchestration. It’s Albéniz in earlier, folk-influenced mien and had much more the conventional sound of Spain, with tambourine, castanets and traditional dance rhythms. It was originally made for two pianos, which shows in those places where you hear pianistic figurations faithfully transcribed into orchestral lines alongside the solo part, but the latter is a considerable virtuoso vehicle – one thoroughly mastered by Roscoe. The atmosphere was there with no mistake, from the opening harp-delivered “guitar” strumming, and the Philharmonic entered its spirit with a will.La Vida Breve is an interesting specimen – almost a kind of national talisman to Spanish performers, I would imagine. It has elements of verismo in its low-life setting, a gypsy community, and Salud is a heroine who’s duped by her lover, Paco, only to discover his marriage to another girl in full swing (complete with flamenco wedding singer). Her uncle wants revenge: she wants confrontation – and when it comes she dies of shame (or something more, if a director is so inclined), as her own song at the outset predicted. The story could be taken from a present-day soap opera, with its pride, passion and sudden death.If Juanjo Mena wanted to set down a recording that encapsulated all its Spanish essence, I’m sure he succeeded. Concert performance is not semi-staging, and the performers were there to sing their roles rather than act them, but it was red-hot nonetheless. The voices themselves carried characterisation, from Fabiola Herrera’s insistent power, Cristina Faus’s more moderated mezzo as her Grandmother, Aquiles Machado’s slimy two-timer Paco, to Josep Miquel Ramón as Manuel, the new bride’s brother who decently tries to keep the show on the road at the reception.A vivid voice contribution came from Segundo Falcón as the wedding singer (with guitarist Vicente Coves in accompaniment) – the real McCoy of flamenco style no doubt, and not an opera-trained singer trying to imitate it. Raquel Lejendio as Carmela, the bride, and Gustavo Peña as the Voice from the forge, completed the cast.But it was very much the orchestra’s day in the sun as well as the soloists’. Nancy Fabiola Herrera (pictured right by Fernando Vázquez Morago) is a great Salud, bringing drama to the tale and a near-declamatory line to her two big scenas, and even she had to battle with the orchestral sound at times – she won most of her contests. The others were not universally successful, and of course balance can be corrected in a recording, so it may sound perfect in transmission.But Mena used his orchestra to paint wonderful pictures – the foreboding of the opening, the hot sunshine of Act One’s workplace, the fabulous panorama of Granada in the first intermezzo (with the chorus ladies woven into the tapestry), the style and swagger of the wedding dance, and the subtler opening to the final tragedy, where the Philharmonic strings provided expressive tone and the scene was built to a dramatic peak of rhythm and life by chorus (hand-clapping in perfect unison) and orchestra together. You don’t need costumes, scenery or much else at all when music depicts a story as skillfully as that, and the BBC Philharmonic gave their departing chief a night to remember.@RobertBealeMcr",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music-opera/roscoe-bbc-philharmonic-mena-bridgewater-hall-manchester-review-scenic-send,4
25,"Giulio Cesare, Glyndebourne review - no weak link",Giulio Cesare,Glyndebourne,2018-06-11,Sebastian Scotney,"What a great show, on every level. David McVicar’s Glyndebourne production of Handel’s Giulio Cesare, originally staged in 2005, and in its third revival this year, has a cast without a weak link, and never fails to draw in the audience to the work’s cycles of power, suffering, death and intermittent triumph. It brings us deep into the mind and essence of every character. And holds us right there. Every time.The big change from the previous seasons is that the production has a new Cleopatra. The role was originally offered for 2005 to Rosemary Joshua but memorably taken in all three previous showings of the piece, in 2005, 2006 and 2009, by Danielle de Niese. In Joélle Harvey, also an American, it has its new star. She has a fine, agile voice and a compelling stage presence which holds the attention naturally, without anything effortful about it. And she can definitely dance. She also brought deep pathos to her Act 3 aria “Piangerò la sorte mia”, aided by a wonderfully supportive and lyrical flute line from Lisa Beznosiuk. Patricia Bardon (pictured above with Christophe Dumaux) was deeply affecting as Cornelia, one of those roles with far more than its fair share of suffering; Anna Stéphany was vocally superb and dramatically convincing as the revenge-seeking son Sesto, John Moore commanded attention as the out-and-out villain Achilla and Christophe Dumaux cunningly brought out the many sides of the complex character Tolomeo. And in a title role which she has made her own, Sarah Connolly never failed to bring dramatic truth and musicality to every moment.Just one example of the way the combination of fine singing and acting work so well together with the care and the detail in this production was in Cesare’s aria “Aure, deh, per pietà spirate”. The really hard ask in Handel is to sustain a mood – in this instance of pain and sorrow – right through the da capo. All I know is that I shall remember for a very long time quite how touchingly Connolly sang the words “dar conforte al mio dolor”, the sadness of Caesar finding its focus as she contemplated a dead soldier on a battlefield. I also found myself simply mesmerized by the perfect pacing which conductor William Christie now brings to the piece. Back in 2005, unless my memory is playing tricks, he would seek out devil-may-care excitement by occasionally teasing out the ritardando endings, stretching them out like pieces of tantric chewing gum, making life hard for the players from the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment – and more or less impossible for the singers. All that has gone. Christie in 2018 is a thoroughly benign force, an enabler; everything just seems so much more natural. He said in an interview five years ago that he would like to be remembered as having “given some people some solace, hope or enjoyment."" A resounding yes to all of those.The creative team of director David McVicar, set designer Robert Jones, costume designer Brigitte Reiffenstuel, lighting director Paule Constable and choreographer Andrew George were loudly and rightly cheered for their work as a cohesive team, bringing endless variety and helping the story to be told (the final scene pictured above). This production is Glyndebourne’s best-seller. And it just got better.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/giulio-cesare-glyndebourne-review-no-weak-link,5
26,"Un ballo in maschera, Grange Park Opera review – singing out against the American grain",Un ballo in maschera,Grange Park Opera  – singing out against the American grain,2018-06-11,Boyd Tonkin,"Stumble across Grange Park Opera’s new brick-clad “Theatre in the Woods”, nestled amid a labyrinth of gardens and orchards next to the rambling Tudor pile of West Horsley Place in Surrey, and on a mild June evening you may feel as if you have fallen into some Home Counties version of a magic-realist novel. The downside of all this bucolic charm is that the drama delivered inside the traditional, four-decker, horseshoe-shaped auditorium – funded and built from scratch by Grange Park’s founder Wasfi Kani after Bamber Gascoigne inherited the West Horsley estate – should always match the enchantment of the setting. Stephen Medcalf’s production of Verdi’s mature masterpiece of conspiracy and concealment, jealousy and assassination, offers enough in the way of vocal and musical highlights to augur well for Grange Park’s second season in its new abode.Claire Rutter’s Amelia (pictured below), in particular, would be worth struggling through miles of Surrey Hills hedgerows and thickets to hear. Conducted by Gianluca Marciano, the English National Opera orchestra and the company chorus anchor the show with well-paced authority and poise. As so often with Un ballo in maschera, though, the director faces a trickier challenge than any demanded by the fancy coloratura twists and leaps that Verdi writes for the pageboy Oscar – one of his rare breeches roles, and delightfully, impressively scaled here by the Armenian soprano Tereza Gevorgyan. The problem is perennial. Verdi, and his librettist Antonio Somma, wrote Un ballo about the assassination of the Swedish King Gustav III in 1792. In late-1850s Naples, the censors vetoed any such depiction of a European monarch’s murder – in France, Napoleon III had just survived an attempt on his life. Hence the opera, somewhat absurdly, crossed the Atlantic to take place in a fantasy of colonial-era Boston, but still replete with the mental and cultural baggage of the aristocratic, honour-obsessed Old World. Lately, productions have tended to relocate the story back in Europe; Tim Albery’s recent staging for Opera North followed this line. For Grange Park, however, it’s a case of the Stars and Stripes forever. We open on a stage festooned with the flag, and at close of play Riccardo (“governor of Boston”) expires, and forgives his wife Amelia, while fetchingly wrapped in Old Glory. Rather than stay in the pre-independence period (when European rituals of courtly hierarchy still just about made sense in New England), Medcalf fast-forwards to the Civil War era. He and set designer Jamie Vartan do stick to their American guns (Winchester Repeaters, maybe). Staging and costumes keep to the programme and create a coherent visual style. Oscar in his/her Wild West jacket even brings a touch of Davy Crockett to the Boston court. But this firmly Puritan and Republican America feels more remote from the spirit of the piece than a pre-revolutionary location might have done. Yes, that stiff Yankee sobriety can help account for the anguished, almost Brief Encounter-style restraint of the never-quite adulterous lovers. But what to do with the charismatic sorceress Ulrica, whose prophecy warns Riccardo (disguised as a fisherman) that he will die not in battle but at the hands of a friend? Here, Ulrica becomes a sort of white-robed Haitian vodou priestess surrounded by her ghostly entourage – grinning skulls, fowl sacrifice, leaping flames and all. It makes for a striking tableau, if slightly too much tinged with Hammer Horror trimmings (“I must commune with Satan”, Ulrica sings). And Italian mezzo Elisabetta Fiorello sings the spooky soothsayer with a flamboyantly old-school vibrato that could hardly sound less American. Verdi mines music of spectacular variety, depth and range Medcalf does grasp that all the chief characters – the ghastly, spectral Ulrica included – have their own masks to maintain. Riccardo has to conceal his love for Amelia, wife of his bosom-pal and political confidant, Renato. Amelia writhes in the anguish of her guilty, but never-consummated, extra-marital passion. The conspirators – here, the sort of gloomy frock-coated gang who might have done for Abraham Lincoln – must pursue their dark designs amid the shadows. From this fatal ravine that divides public role and private need, Verdi, on the brink of his late-career peaks such as Don Carlo and Otello, mines music of spectacular variety, depth and range. At first, Vincenzo Costanzo as the vacillating Riccardo sounded somewhat tentative, strained and squeezed towards the top of his range. His tenor blossomed and strengthened as the night wore on. By the time of his final arias – notably his great renunciation of illicit love, “Ma se m'è forza perderti” – he commanded the stage. Renato, the betrayed best mate who becomes Riccardo’s bitter enemy and enraged nemesis, finds a consistently firm and affecting interpreter in Roland Wood’s baritone – especially as, with a tone of genuine heartbreak, he laments his lost happiness with Amelia in “Eri tu che macchiavi quell’anima”. Claire Rutter shines from first to last as Amelia. Her great duet with Riccardo at the gallows tree – here summoned by some stylised hanging fronds – brings out her best: vulnerable and imperious at once, utterly assured yet without any harshness. This is the moment when you realise that Un ballo was composed around the same time as Tristan und Isolde. Rutter, at any rate, rises to the scene’s scorching intensity. Fierce private passions must, ineluctably, break through the civic disguises worn by these reluctant double-dealers. The sinister, chilling “laughing chorus” that winds up the second act showed how much any staging of Un ballo rests on a tight-knit choral band of solid (if gossipy) citizenry. We had that here. As for the closing ball itself, Nicky Shaw’s costumes summon a mood of sober splendour as the conspiracy hurtles towards its climax when Renato shoots (rather than stabs) Riccardo. Now in uniform, Tereza Gevorgyan’s Oscar (pictured above) threatened (not for the first time) to run away with the show as she taunted Renato with her canzone “Saper vorreste”. As before in Medcalf’s version, you felt that this music – and this emotion – belong in a world far distant from 19th-century Boston, however thoughtful the conception that has planted the opera there. In the pit, Marciano and the ENO band certainly played with a far-from-Puritan élan, eloquent, singing woodwinds to the fore. Medcalf’s all-American reading has clarity and impact. But visitors to the West Horsley woods may – above all thanks to Rutter and Gevorgyan – end up waving a flag for the free republic of music alone.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/un-ballo-maschera-grange-park-opera-review-%E2%80%93-singing-out-against-american-grain,4
27,"Lohengrin, Royal Opera review - swan mystery musically illuminated",Lohengrin,Royal Opera,2018-06-08,David Nice,"It's awfully long for a fairytale in which a mystery prince helps a damsel in distress, and she asks him the question she shouldn't. Myth tends to go deeper, as Wagner did in The Ring of the Nibelung after Lohengrin. Here he captures the magic of transformation and transcendence, but in between there's too much hard-to-stage pomp. Director David Alden treats it all too predictably, with images of post-war ruin – tilted, tottering shells of buildings – and fascist paraphernalia (the swan motif in Nazi colours). The real light of the piece is there in the music, led with bright breadth by the magnificent Andris Nelsons.At least the sheer beauty of the grail kingdom and the dove descending unfold in the Prelude with the curtain down, to be explained (unconvincingly given the production's contrariness) four hours later. Against a first-night barrage of coughs, Nelsons nevertheless got a Royal Opera Orchestra on top form to inscape the pianissimos and enrich the climax. There is only a glimmer of optimism in a grimly ritualistic first act which starts out like a production of Strauss's Salome, with accused innocent Elsa coming out of an underground prison instead of John the Baptist: Lohengrin arrives to the projected beating of swans' wings (pictured below), and the stage briefly opens up a little, though it's not clear why the man in the white suit would tolerate the Nazification of his trademark in the following acts, or its use on the colossal monument which serves for the minster in which he and Elsa are to be married. The men are bores until the hero glides in, but two are staunchly sung by Kostas Smoriginas as a Herald with a caliper on his left leg (why?) and the resplendent bass Georg Zeppenfeld as King Henry (Tristan's King Mark is a much more interesting role for him). Thomas J Mayer, keeping his own hair like Klaus Florian Vogt's Lohengrin, in this case to remind one inappropriately of the great Bill Bailey, is more of a cipher as villain Telramund; he's the only singer who doesn't always hold his own against the opulent sound from the pit. Vogt brings his familiar, slightly feminine sweetness and openness of sound; there's tinsel rather than solid gold in the lines, not always interestingy phrased, but he can sing quietly, something to be prized in a Wagnerian tenor.The whole thing really takes off when Irish soprano Jennifer Davis crowns the Act One ensemble, and again in her Elsa's confrontation with the scheming Ortrud in Act Two (pictured below). An exciting substitution for Kristine Opolais, much as we miss her, Davis is a recent graduate of the Royal Opera's Jette Parker Young Artists Programme; she sang Mozart, Nielsen and Bizet at the 2017 Europe Day Concert, and radiant Strauss in the JPYAP summer showcase. With a lyric voice verging on the heroic, strong and even throughout the range, and utterly plausible acting at every point, she made a fine impression.She has what Christine Goerke as Ortrud no longer possesses – a secure and brilliant upper register – but that only made the scene between the innocent and the depraved all the stronger. Other Elsas who have a more other-worldly sound in the first act don't come out as strongly in their conviction of good in the second; there was potential heartbreak in this girl's assurance, and queasiness in Ortrud's woeful misreading of her behaviour as prideful. Davis can also manage Wagner's romantic gruppetti or turns with absolute clarity; hopefully she can carry on singing Mozart and not too much more Wagner too soon to keep the voice in perfect shape.Goerke cuts like a knife with a hit-and-miss roughness to the top, not inappropriate to the role, slightly overdoing some witchy vowel sounds and asked by Alden to act out the familiar cliché of the power-suited woman who lets down her hair, strips down to a black slip and straddles her man. It's a stock operatic baddie role, and there's no getting around that. But she's a presence as Mayer's Telramund is not, and the wedding confrontation is conventionally powerful grand opera, none the worse for that. What's the significance of the bridal cortège reaching out into a lit-up auditorium, and rushing around it in the brilliant Act Three Prelude (loud as the orchestra was, the sudden stomping still made me jump)? A suggestion that Elsa and Lohengrin have the potential to break out of their time? The jury's out on that one, though the bridal suite, once the stilted semaphoring of the vocally splendid chorus has left it to the temporarily happy couple, looks striking in the third of Paul Steinberg's fine design ideas, August von Heckel's 19th century painting of Lohengrin in Antwerp hanging above the white-linened bed (pictured above).Davis holds her own here, too, pushing the question with perfect dramatic intensity; Vogt's sternness is impressive, though he's a bit short-winded in the final revelation which Wagner inflicts so unkindly on the tenor at the end of a long evening. Nelsons supports perfectly; elsewhere he asks for a breadth which the singers are mostly able to provide, and the correspondence between pit and stage, the conductor's beat always held high, is as perfect as you're likely to get in the opera house. For that, and some remarkable singing which ticks the right Wagnerian boxes, this Lohengrin cries out to be seen and heard.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/lohengrin-royal-opera-review-swan-mystery-musically-illuminated,4
28,"La finta semplice, Classical Opera, QEH review - consummate musicianship stokes early Mozart",La finta semplice,Classical Opera,2018-06-07,David Nice,"You can always be sure of impeccable casting and spirited playing as Ian Page takes his Classical Opera through Mozart year by year. Just don't expect more than the glimmer of genius to come in 1768, though. It doesn't matter in those admirable showcase programmes highlighting the young Amadeus alongside more mature voices of the year in question. A three-act opera is rather more a vexation to the spirit, though. If the composer had no more than a few flashes of genius in his pre- and early teens, the libretto for La finta semplice could have been written by an average 10 year old (horrifyingly, it turns out to be supposed master of comedy Goldoni not too heavily adapted by one Coltellini).Was a fine team enough to carry it? Eventually, though you wait through a long first act for more than the very basic mechanics of opera buffa. The overture has a lively third section (the three movements made up an early symphony). It’s good to get a quartet serving as a cheap chorus to steel us for the perfunctory arias to come, though in the first of many contradictory sentiments, the tenet “freedom is better than love” doesn’t seem suitable for this amorous imbroglio. Giacinta (lustrous Austrian mezzo Sophie Rennert, perhaps the most vivid actor of the company) wants to marry a Hungarian captain oddly called Fracasso (Thomas Elwin, perhaps the least relaxed in Page’s perfectly competent staging) but she needs to get her mysogynist and idiot brothers to accept him. How? Set Fracasso’s sister Rosina on them as the “feigned simpleton” of the title who will promise to marry them both. The ensuing shenanigans could be sharp and funny. They aren’t, but one of the two dupes and their guller have some good music. Rosina seeks to be guarded against the arrows of little cupids in an Act 2 aria, “Amoretti che ascosi,” complete with surprisingly sophisticated sighs and trills from the strings. Soprano Regula Mühlemann (pictured above on the right with Chiara Skerath and Alessandro Fisher) sings it, and all else, exquisitely. And the fall guy Don Polidoro gets a schizoid number pointing forward to the two-gear ""Tradito, schernito"" of Ferrando in Così fan tutte. In it, he's ardent and tender to the woman he supposedly doesn’t know how to woo (“Sposa cara”) while railing against his drunken brother. Given tenor Alessandro Fisher’s honeyed tones, Rosina might have done better to choose him; why she falls for Don Cassandro is a mystery, especially since Lukas Jakobski overplays his hand, if resplendently.There are pretty ditties for maid Ninetta, delivered by Chiara Skerath with style and bags of character, and bluff ones for her reluctant wooer Simone (engaging bass superb Božidar Smiljanić). Giacinta, clearly the terza donna or third lady in Mozart’s pecking-order, gets a belated, brief but precociously intense Sturm und Drang number as she quails at the thought of one brother's wrath, and a G major plea for forgiveness in a finale of many tempi, backed up by Ninetta, which may have rung anticipatory bells for many listeners familiar with the Count’s similar asking towards the end of The Marriage of Figaro. Rennert (pictured above with Smiljanić) delivered both impeccably; we wait to see her here in something more substantial (she gave the most moving account I’ve heard of Dido’s lament in the 2014 Europe Day Concert, and was superb as Handel's Lotario at the 2017 Göttingen International Handel Festival). And the whole evening passed tolerably at worst, vividly at best, with fabulous continuo support for the keenly articulated recitatives from Pawel Siwczak, Alex Rolton and the vivid double bass of Cecelia Bruggemeyer. The acoustics of the revamped Queen Elizabeth Hall can be a bit too swimmy for this music, and Page posed a few problems by having the singers so far in front of the orchestra, but he was quick to catch them when togetherness threatened to falter. When the recording eventually emerges, it will be the one to have if you want this in your Mozart discography.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-finta-semplice-classical-opera-qeh-review-consummate-musicianship-stokes-early-mozart,4
29,"Der fliegende Holländer, Longborough Festival review - stand and deliver on an empty stage",Der fliegende Holländer,Longborough Festival,2018-06-07,stephen Walsh,"Brilliant and innovative though it is in many respects, The Flying Dutchman is by no means a straightforward piece to stage. It’s an odd, sometimes uncomfortable mixture of the genre and the epic. At Sadler’s Wells in the sixties they had a little ship and a big ship that hove into view, a fishing village, sailors with tankards and striped shirts, and girls at looms. At Bayreuth in the eighties Harry Kupfer set the whole piece in a lunatic asylum, which solved all dramaturgical problems, if at some psychological cost. Now, at Longborough, Thomas Guthrie and his designer, Ruth Paton, have neither ships nor mental home, no village (apart from a few model houses against the last act backcloth), a painted ocean (of sorts), a few girls making, or mending, nets, and above all no sign of the Dutchman’s portrait, which one might think the one prop sine qua non, mentioned countless times, and the chief engine of the plot. Instead Senta sits during the overture looking at what might be his picture in a book; later Mary (Senta’s old nurse, here recast as the girls’ overseer) tears it up; later still Erik seems to produce another copy. We the audience never see it.  Finally, there being no cliff to jump off, Senta stabs herself on the empty stage and the Dutchman reappears like Pinkerton, apparently redeemed simply because Wagner - in his serene D major - says he is. In short, this is a blank staging, a tabula rasa, which throws all its weight on to the individual characters: Daland, the bluff, mercenary sea captain, his daughter Senta, the dreamy fantasist, Erik, the lovelorn hunter, and the Dutchman himself, Faust in sea boots. This might work if the staging itself were more responsive to the conflicts that already begin to show Wagner’s genius for psychological theatre. But Guthrie is, let’s say, inclined to be discreet in this respect. One longs for a more fluid interaction between these unhappy personalitiesAs in his Marriage of Figaro here a couple of years ago, he favours the stand-and-deliver aria mode, face front, and no distracting movement. There are occasional exceptions, but the general effect is wooden, statuesque. One longs for a more fluid interaction between these unhappy personalities. Even the sailors in Wagner’s astonishing last act chorus (something he later decried in Opera and Drama) simply face the audience and bounce up and down. They sing with vigour, if not exceptional refinement. But Wagner’s deep dramatic polyphonies deserve something more.I’m about to say, of course, that the music redeems all under the dependable Anthony Negus. But alas not, or at least not yet. Kirstin Sharpin is a radiant, fresh-voiced Senta, though a stodgy actress, and there is a personable, energetically sung Erik from Jonathan Stoughton, who craved indulgence for some illness or other but hardly showed it. William Wallace sings the Steersman’s song solidly if not quite prettily, leaning on the proscenium arch.But the all-important bass singing leaves a good deal to be desired. Simon Thorpe (pictured above, right, with Richard Wiegold) is a versatile performer, but here, in what I take to be his first major Wagner role, he tends to force, with damaging effects on his intonation. Richard Wiegold has no need to force as Daland: his is a huge vibrant bass, marred though by coarse phrasing and occasionally rough production. Maybe this is his way of “being” Daland, but if so it does the music, in Wagner’s old-fashioned lyrical vein, less than justice.Negus’s reading (the first two acts joined, as in the original score, the third act separate to allow a dinner interval) is on the slow side and a shade cautious. Problems of ensemble suggest under-preparation, most unusually for him, but after all he can’t force the singers to watch and listen. Even the orchestral playing has its rough edges, especially in the woodwind writing, one of the score’s important innovations. But these are one hopes teething troubles. If only the production could be got moving, its lack of specificity would matter less and the music would benefit.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/der-fliegende-holl%C3%A4nder-longborough-festival-review-stand-and-deliver-empty-stage,2
30,"Capriccio, Garsington Opera review - a classy evening with words and music",Capriccio,Garsington Opera,2018-06-04,David Nice,"Like the comedies of Mozart – the genius the artistic milieu depicted in Capriccio seems to be waiting for, if its original 1770s setting is observed – the more conversational operas of Richard Strauss depend far more than one often realises on conducting that sets a stylish, buoyant pace. Without it, and even more more rehearsal time than Garsington allows, musical heaven remains just out of reach. This was still a classy performance, always well co-ordinated between stage and pit, strongly cast and handsomely conceived, an elegant entertainment about the nature of opera and its sister arts tailor-made for an afternoon and evening in one of southern England's most beautiful valleys.By merely alluding to the rococo in the salon of a country house otherwise elegantly modern (early 1940s was the aim), director Tim Albery's production and Tobias Hoheisel's designs, first seen at Santa Fe but fitting the open, connected ambience of Garsington Opera's fabulously designed pavilion, keep the neoclassical element just alive in what still feels like a contemporary environment. Here the meaning of art can once again be discussed in detachment, parallel to the aching context of David Hare's The Moderate Soprano, which would seem in retrospect to have elements of Capriccio in mind. Strauss may have intended to allude to the destruction of all he cherished in revolutionary destruction just around the corner for the inhabitants of the French chateau, and bombs were falling when Capriccio was premiered in 1942.Should one worry that the light tone with which serious artistic ideas are laid before the public avoids completely the wider implications of the time in which it was written? Not at all, declares this very up-to-the-minute conversation piece. At Garsington you don't ask what doubtful act allows such frivolity in a sunlit chateau; the questions of Auden's ""A Summer Night"" don't arise if the times of day indicated in the work are mirrored in the seeming harmony of what's going on in nature outside, as they certainly were yesterday (even if the Gettys' reintroduced red kites are always coasting ready to snatch prey from above). Stardust has fallen on Garsington in the shape of Swedish soprano Miah Persson (pictured above with William Dazeley), graduated now from sweet ingenues like Sophie in Robert Carsen’s Salzburg Rosenkavalier and Anne Trulove in the Glyndebourne revival of Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress to Strauss’s grandes dames. Countess Madeleine isn’t so easy to care for: a privileged if witty flirt who here snogs a poet and a composer in quick succession, whose only dilemma is which to choose (and that always seems easy, given that she prefers music to words and exits to one of composer Flamand’s themes running in the orchestra). Reminiscent of Renée Fleming in manner, Persson falls just a little short of the natural charm with which Felicity Lott overcame all reservations at Glyndebourne. But she’s absolutely the right Strauss voice, unfolding all but the most extreme high lines with warmth and opulence.If only her conversations with the men in her life – her brother (William Dazeley), Flamand (Sam Furness) and the poet Olivier (Gavan Ring) – were more flexibly supported by conductor Douglas Boyd. You feel that all three men might be less inclined to megaphone their responses with a lighter touch from the pit, though all are first-rate singers, and it’s Furness who carries off the ardour best; he delivers his setting of Olivier’s (in fact Ronsard’s) Sonnet very sensitively, even if last night it was just a bit under the note (that happens).Both Furness and Ring act out their scoffing of theatre impresario La Roche’s extravagant plans to celebrate the Countess’s birthday with vigour and precision. These two ensembles after an interval which the Strauss family never wanted, but which Glyndebourne established as a precedent, are perhaps the highlights of the evening. Albery keeps his directorial hand unobtrusive, but deftly tells us who the characters are before a note has even been played - nice parallels with the company work in the Maly Theatre production of Uncle Vanya - and wisely empties the stage for the orchestra to have the Moonlight Music and the final word to itself. Perhaps first horn Caroline O'Connell gives us the subtlest singing of all at both these points.At any rate the central debates on the nature of opera and theatre, always witty and well lined in Strauss’s own libretto in conjunction with the conductor Clemens Krauss, really zing with clarity from all, and the Italian Soprano, soaringly sung by promising newcomer Nika Gorič, caps the lines beautifully with her drunken observations. Andrew Shore (pictured above with Ring and Furness) carries off La Roche’s giant riposte with enough stage presence – his Impresario is childlike rather than a blustering boor – to keep it authoritative, though even heavily cut it’s a bit much for his voice at this late stage (a shame, as in the Royal Opera's concert performance, to also lose Strauss's references to his own earlier operas shortly afterwards). Veteran Graham Clark needs to keep the level down to lend the right nocturnal strangeness to the belated appearance of prompt Monsieur Taupe, though it's good to have a great former Mime playing another deluded king of the underworld. Youthfulness keeps the rest sparkling. Hanna Hipp is stylish, with fruity chest tones, playing arch actress Clairon as a 1940s Hollywood film star (shades of Bette Davis’s Margo Channing?) Ballerina Lowri Shone does pleasing work to a Couperinesque dance suite and young singers from the ever-excellent Garsington Chorus characterise the commenting servants with charm and aplomb.It was also surprising to read in the programme that four of the players in the ravishing String Sextet which opens the work are from the Royal Academy of Music (pictured above); it’s as polished and expressive a performance as ever you’ll hear. If the full orchestra which follows sometimes feels too heavy for so needle-point a comedy, individual wind solos, especially the lower ones, are always clear and beautiful, and if ultimately one comes out without shedding a tear for the Countess’s final scene – just a bit trammelled here, without the billowing support a great Strauss conductor can provide – there’s still a song in the heart for this wise and witty endgame.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/capriccio-garsington-opera-review-classy-evening-words-and-music,4
31,"Così fan tutte, Opera Holland Park review - the pain behind the prettiness",Così fan tutte,Opera Holland Park,2018-06-02,Boyd Tonkin,"A proper production of Così fan tutte should make you feel as if the script for a barrel-scraping Carry On film has been hi-jacked by Shakespeare and Chekhov – working as a team. The story is so silly (even nasty), the music so sublime. When, in Oliver Platt’s production for Opera Holland Park, Eleanor Dennis’s Fiordiligi jumps on the furniture to proclaim her devotion to her absent betrothed as a visiting “Albanian” tries to woo her, we stand, as usual, just a hair’s breadth away from utter farce. Then she sings “Come scoglio”, a hymn to steadfastness and constancy that soars above its knockabout setting like a star above a swamp.On holiday in Naples, the sisters from Ferrara, Fiordiligi and Dorabella, have bid farewell to their fiancés Guglielmo and Ferrando after the sleazy old schemer Don Alfonso has arranged for the pair of pranksters to return in disguise as exotic “Albanians” in order to test the ladies’ virtue. Alfonso’s farewell trio with the two sopranos triggers a low-down intrigue that lurches between pantomime, absurdity and (for many critics, from the 19th century on) outright misogyny. Così Fan Tutte – dames, they’re all the same, ready despite all their virtue-signalling to jump into the arms and beds of the first (turbaned and mustachioed) stud to roll along. Yet that trio, ""Soave sia il vento"", will surely usher the souls of the blessed into whatever paradise may await us. The plot, and Da Ponte’s libretto, weaves a tissue of lies, stunts and frauds. Mozart, impossibly, makes these ditzes, jocks and stirrers sing it all into absolute truth. With its rococo decorations, sun-dappled, flower-strewn garden rooms and warm summer shades, Oliver Platt’s production has a relaxed, even old-fashioned ambience. That initially hints at a genial, irony-free perspective on opera’s ultimate problem comedy. The action sometimes contracts to the suspicion-filled white room where Alfonso’s ruse plays out, sometimes expands to occupy the whole vast width of the Holland Park stage. The robust ranks of the Opera Holland Park chorus supply the colourful (and tuneful) Neapolitan street life. In Alyson Cummins’s design, this picturesque loveliness sets a sort of trap. There are serpents gliding through this Mediterranean garden. As the “Albanians”, Nicholas Lester as Guglielmo and Nick Pritchard as Ferrando (pictured above by Ali Wright) swagger around in the traditional “oriental” fancy dress. The sisters – Eleanor Dennis’s Fiordiligi, Kitty Whately’s Dorabella – flounce and purr as Georgian belles who could have stepped from a Gainsborough frame. At first, the bitter, mirthless Cosìs of some recent directors feel a long sea voyage away. Uniformly strong, a young cast balances larks with grace as the ever-changing score demands. Dennis brings a fine dramatic presence to her shattering soliloquy ""Per pietà"". The honey-voiced Pritchard commands some show-stealing moments in Act II – not least in the duet with Fiordiligi, ""Fra gli amplessi"", as the lads’s game of “get off with your mate’s girlfriend” deepens into music of exquisite, excruciating ambiguity.Kitty Whately’s Dorabella finds rich hues of perplexity and darkness in the (supposedly) flightier sister’s role. As Despina, the megalomaniac maidservant who conspires with Alfonso, Sarah Tynan (pictured below by Robert Workman with Peter Coleman-Wright) has an agility and assurance – especially when in disguise as doctor and lawyer – that reveal the character’s sinister as well as charming side. Mordant, even rasping, Peter Coleman-Wright’s Alfonso rightly sounds more cynical roué than Enlightenment-era “philosopher”. So much of Così rests on the nuanced symmetries and reflections of the score, as duets, trios and even sestets match, augment or sometimes cancel out each other. For all its comeliness, Platt’s staging made that implacable internal logic – the critic Edward Said even speaks of Mozart’s “cold mastery” – clearly visible. Step by step, trick by trick, the tone darkens, both emotionally and (as night falls over Holland Park and candles illuminate the boudoirs and gardens of Naples) physically as well. Virtually no staging today can ever swallow whole the fanciful finale of Così, with the duped girls meekly accepting their fate as guinea-pigs for Alfonso’s abusive experiments. Platt duly tweaks the closing scene in ways that (for me) recalled the revisionist endings we now expect in Shakespeare’s The Taming of the Shrew. Brisk and sharp, Dane Lam’s conducting steered the City of London Sinfonia away from the romantic yearning that can smother some performances. He grasps that Mozart layers this uniquely bittersweet sound-world – how does he do it?  – with so much pathos, melancholy, anguish even, that it needs no bossy over-emphasis. On the surface, this Così rocks no boats and will win few plaudits for sheer originality. Yet, as the Holland Park peacocks added their own eerie embellishments and the evening’s promised thunder stayed away, it needed no gimmicks. The storms within the music had already struck with their heart-breaking, life-changing force.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/cos%C3%AC-fan-tutte-opera-holland-park-review-pain-behind-prettiness,4
32,"Die Zauberflöte, Garsington Opera review - visually stimulating, conceptually confusing",Die Zauberflöte,Garsington Opera,2018-06-01,alexandra Coghlan,"Something is afoot at Garsington this season. Walking past the lake you might just catch sight of three strange figures in the distance – white-clad pawns engaged in a solemn game of human chess. Continue towards the auditorium and, somewhere among the topiary, there’s a splash of colour. A man with the cap and long red robes of an Inquisitor stands silently and contemplates the statuary. Opera, once again it seems, has fallen through the looking glass.Like so many directors before her, Netia Jones turns her gaze back on itself for the new production of Mozart’s Die Zauberflote that opens Garsington’s 2018 season. There’s something about the ambient, immersive quality of country house opera that seems to inspire this kind of self-referential play, not so much navel- as cummerbund-gazing. Dressed up in our strange costumes, wandering incongruously through the English countryside, we offer ourselves as willing extras in the drama, ready to be co-opted, confronted, coerced into the action.So it’s no surprise to enter the auditorium and find ourselves outside in Wormsley’s own box-edged lawns and gardens, staring at the manor itself. Perched on its façade like so many sinister pigeons are clusters of grey security cameras – just in case we were in any doubt as to where the gaze of this production was pointing. But having got us in her sights, Jones proceeds to baffle, serving up a Magic Flute that seems designed as a modern parable, but whose determined relevance renders Mozart’s most magical, allusive opera curiously literal and inert.First, the good. Jones has designed one of the handsomest productions we’ve ever seen in this auditorium. Her signature monochromes are off-set by pops of deep red, green and orange, and her subtle video work brings depth and intrigue to a flat set. Costumes that riot between the 16th and 20th centuries, with just a hint of dystopian future thrown in for good measure, offer plenty to delight the eye and plenty of food for the mind to chew on.The Upstairs, Downtairs quality of the country house setting allows Jones to embrace the contradictions and polarities of the piece into a single milieu, revealing tensions and contradiction within rather than between worlds. This is a production that’s good at undercutting, interrogating. Any moment of beauty or sweetness is spiced with doubt. Papageno lovingly skins and guts a rabbit during his charming first aria; Monostatos and his men dance, compelled not by the twinkling magic bells but by the strafing barrel of a shotgun. Here is beauty and order, certainly, but facilitated by the grubby below-stairs labours of meat-cleaver-wielding Monostatos and his fellow workers – the silent army of bonnet-clad women, refugees from The Handmaid’s Tale – without whose invisible labour the brotherhood could not free their minds so effectively to contemplate higher thingsIt may all be true and topical, but the trouble is it’s not terribly interesting – a story about superstition and enlightenment rationalism is transposed to patriarchal privilege and female emancipation. The joy of Mozart’s strange creature of a final opera is its anarchic, elusive quality – allegory more as a mode than as a fixed set of meaning. Jones may have succeeded in subduing the piece’s more stubborn difficulties, but it’s at the expense of the life of the work, pinned fatally in place like a lepidopterist’s specimen.Which is a shame because this is as strong a cast as Garsington has ever fielded. Soprano Louise Alder (currently alternating Garsington’s Flute with performances of Der Rosenkavalier at Glyndebourne: pictured right, with James Creswell's Sarastro) brings just enough grit to the gloss of Mozart’s least interesting heroine. Her Pamina is sceptical, assertive – a bold figure in slacks among all the aprons and bonnets – who scoffs at a prince who could fall in love with a girl he has never met. She finds her match in Benjamin Hulett’s Tamino. Heroic of voice and presence (no crooning for his “Dies Bildnis”), he’s no fey princeling – a match if ever there was one for James Creswell’s luxurious Sarastro.But if Jones and conductor Christian Curnyn discussed their various approaches there’s little evidence of it here in the music. Taking away every phrase-ending, lightening and quickening every texture and tempo, finding the dance under every aria, Curnyn conducts a delightful Handel comedy, while on stage Jones gives us a Mozart near-tragedy. Only Creswell has the force of musical personality to carve the beauty, space and depth out of this glorious score, giving us pause among so much brittleness. Jonathan McGovern sings a lovely Papageno, but with the role shorn of all comedy (save a blissful final scene with Lara Marie Muller’s delicious Papagena) he’s given little to work with.An awkward ending (no spoilers here) offers a problematic resolution to Jones’s Gender Studies seminar of a production.

33,"Der Rosenkavalier, Glyndebourne - detailed acting, great singing",Der Rosenkavalier,Glyndebourne,2018-05-21,David Nice,"If Hugo von Hofmannsthal's libretto for Richard Strauss in their joint ""comedy for music"" is the apogee of elaborately referenced dialogue and stage directions in opera, Richard Jones's realisation - for all that it throws out much of the original rulebook - may well be the most rigorously detailed production on the operatic stage today. Seeing it live a second time after its dizzying 2014 premiere as resurrected by his trusted movement director Sarah Fahie leaves me reeling with surprise, admiration and perplexity for how much more there's still to discover in its symmetries and ambiguities - not least with a complete change of cast for the four main roles.Glyndebourne Music Director Robin Ticciati has returned to fine-tune his way through the Strauss labyrinth - more luminous than ever in the purple passages, more incisive in the rapidity of what turns out to be black comedy in Act Three, with incredible clarity from lower strings bringing out yet more details in a fathomless score. This seemed last night as far as it's possible to go in perfect mastery of Strauss's cornucopia (I choose the term carefully bearing in mind the horniest of operatic preludes). Co-ordination with the new team will improve in the first act when they settle to some of his slower tempi (though clearly Siberian tenor Andrej Dunaev was having a bad night in his few minutes as the Italian Tenor, cracking up top and then taking the higher notes down the octave. It happens; he was fine first time around). Certainly the Marschallin this time round for half the performances, Rachel Willis-Sørensen (alternating with Michaela Kaune, and pictured above going back to her youth for David Harrison's Dr Freud), is very different - more opulent of figure than the model-like Kate Royal, avoiding the Venus Anodyomene body-stocking moment on curtain-up, but just as fair and expressive of face, and much more ample of tone. Too ample at times, perhaps, for this size of house - not so Covent Garden, where  I first heard her in the role - but she knows how to scale back to velvety softness and intimacy. The test-case of floating her last phrase in Act One was triumphantly surmounted, and the final tableau where Jones leaves his Marschallin alone with her love-struck page Mohammed - Adrian Richards, exquisitely touching and funny - brought the requisite tears to the eyes at the end of an act which, thanks to Paul Steinberg's flattened set, Nicky Gillibrand's ever-surprising costume melange and Mimi Jordan Sherin's lighting as revived by Nigel Pashley, is otherwise a slightly nightmarish Wonderland. The volume is impressive for her total command of the ""Viennese masquerade"" in the sleazy room of Act Three, again softened when the personal love-triangle comes to the fore.And you won't hear a more opulent trio anywhere. Uniquely, in my experience, all three ladies hit the heights with equal aplomb. Kate Lindsey is, perhaps, a more conventional 17-year old firebrand than Tara Erraught, not so hilarious as her delightful predecessor in the comedy of Octavian disguised as chamber-maid Mariandel but more flame-toned, and like Willis-Sørensen managing her final pianissimo top note as beautifully as the singer of whom she's most reminiscent, Frederica von Stade. With Erin Morley expecting, as Lindsay was this time last year, two Sophies now step into the breach. I was hoping to catch dream lyric soprano Louise Alder this time round, having set eyes on a born star for the first time when the Glyndebourne covers joined us for a study day back in 2014, but a third American, Elizabeth Sutphen, made a delectably characterful young fighter against her horse-traded marriage - hers was the comedy face this time round (Sutphen pictured above with Michael Kraus's Faninal and Brindley Sherratt's Ochs). From the sound of it her Duenna, Gabriele Rosmanith, would make no less fine a Sophie - we seem to be living in a golden age for this voice-type.Biggest change in the dramatic dynamics comes from Brindley Sherratt's odious groom Baron Ochs. Not a born comedian with the mug for it like oddly lovable predecessor Lars Woldt, he's slow to kindle the laughs but is instead oddly sinister, half cut-price old Tory buffer, half gammon-faced provincial with a hideous wig. His ease with the text shows in the second-act humiliation of his bride to be; by the third act we are so comfortable with his sonorous interpretation - rarely have the bottom notes been so impressive - that we're won over completely, and even - as is intended - feel slightly sorry for this monster in #metoo's eyes having reached the end of the road. And what a stupendous third act it is (pictured above). No-one is likely to come out with the usual cliché that this is where Der Rosenkavalier drags: business with a noose, the gimmicks of the room made for debauchery and the ease with which a crowd brings its chairs for a trial on and off make this charade go like clockwork. Exceptionally well-taken middle and smaller roles this time - Alun Rhys-Jenkins' purposefully pinched-toned scandalmonger Valzacchi and the best coloratura dudgeon ever from Stephanie Lauricella when his accomplice Annina plays a discarded ""Baroness"" Ochs, Martin Snell as an authoritatively phrasing Police Inspector - all add to the richest of mixes. Michael Kraus reprises his vocally lustrous Addams Family father Faninal. And let's not forget, among the perfect actors, the six foot six bastard son Leopold, Joseph Badar; this production would not be the same without him. The mastery with which Strauss and Hofmannsthal transition from farce to bittersweet sentiment seems all the more miraculous given such incredible fluidity. This is a tour de force of operatic staging, matched this time by much more sheerly beautiful singing.

34,"Madama Butterfly, Glyndebourne review - perverse staging, outstanding cast",Madama Butterfly,Glyndebourne,2018-05-20,stephen Walsh,"Puccini’s heroines and the rough treatment he hands out to them have come in for plenty of opprobrium over the years. But just occasionally they fight back on his behalf in the person of an outstanding singing actress; and this is exactly the case with Glyndebourne’s initial offering of their new season, a revival of Annilese Miskimmon’s Madama Butterfly, first seen as part of the company’s tour in 2016, and given a somewhat dusty reception on The Arts Desk.The production itself, in Nicky Shaw’s designs, seems not to have changed much. There remains the modish and apparently pointless update to the 1950s (in Nagasaki, for heaven’s sake!). There remains the self-defeating relocation of the first act to the agent Goro’s office, which makes nonsense of so many details in the scenario that one hardly knows where to begin listing them. There remain all kinds of lapel-clutching double underlinings of the otherwise (not so) easily missed anti-American subtext of the libretto, which both insult the audience’s intelligence and successfully undermine the real magic of Pinkerton’s (admittedly very temporary) passion for his little Japanese geisha (Olga Busoloc and Joshua Guerrero pictured below in the Act One duet). But this is where the superb Moldovan soprano Olga Busuioc comes in and, with the help of an excellent if not very assertive young American tenor, Joshua Guerrero, suddenly brings direction and shape to the Miskimmon “concept”. My wife asked, rhetorically: is Cio-Cio San a tragic figure? And too often the answer is: no, she’s just a passive #MeToo victim. But Busuioc shows, in a performance of sustained dramatic intensity and vocal brilliance, that “povera Butterfly” is a figure who can grow in stature as she sheds her oriental passivity, is abandoned by friends and family and ridiculed by the Japanese agent (pimp?) whose sole aim was to sell her to the highest bidder.Here the fifties revamp of her little casetta in the second act does begin to make some kind of sense. The absurd sub-American G-plan drawing room and the poor girl’s smart western suit are a cruel - perhaps crude - image of her escape from - well, from what exactly in post-war Nagasaki, but let’s not quibble too much. And when Busuioc delivers her “Un bel di,” so to speak, to the audience rather than to her maid, Suzuki, she truly seems to be looking out and beyond, to something longed for but alas misunderstood and that will, in the end, destroy her. Not a bad definition of tragedy, perhaps. Busuioc (pictured above) is also equal to the draining and drawn-out pathos of the final scene, which few sopranos can make even bearable, let alone plausible. She is marvellously supported, it must be said. Elizabeth DeShong, a mezzo who has sung Cenerentola, is sheer luxury as Suzuki, and Michael Sumuel is a fine, dark-voiced Sharpless who brings just the right blend of humanity and bewilderment to a role that specifically limits the blanket racial stereotypes built into this scenario. Carlo Bosi is a suitably slimy Goro singing, nevertheless, a strong, clear tenor, and there is a string of crisp vignettes from Simon Mechlinski (Yamadori), Oleg Budaratskiy (Bonze), and others too numerous to list, as well as from the excellent Glyndebourne Chorus as a wholeWhatever you think of Puccini as a tragedian, his mastery of his craft is beyond question. You can listen to the orchestration of Madama Butterfly and marvel at its precision and delicacy. Omer Meir Wellber draws consistently refined, energetic playing from the London Philharmonic Orchestra, needing only, perhaps, to attend a shade more, now and then, to his singers. Which brings me back to the staging: annoying and perverse in many respects, but with something at its core that an exceptional cast proves able to bring out.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/madama-butterfly-glyndebourne-review-perverse-staging-outstanding-cast,4
35,"The Rosenkavalier film, OAE, Paterson, QEH review - silent-era muddle expertly accompanied",The Rosenkavalier film,OAE,2018-05-18,David Nice,"Let's face it, Robert ""Cabinet of Dr Caligari"" Wiene's 1926 film loosely based on Strauss and Hofmannsthal's 1911 ""comedy for music"" is a mostly inartistic ramble. Historically, though, it proves fascinating. The composer mostly left it to Otto Singer and Carl Alwin to cut and paste large chunks of his opera, adding four old pieces and one new one - a major contribution to the art of through-composed scoring for silent film (Shostakovich's wholly original New Babylon music came three years later). Strauss's ""house poet"" saw the chance to shed new light on fascinating characters and to encourage a wider audience to go and see the opera, but was eventually sidelined as lesser talents took over, a familiar story in the world of cinema. The decor was by Alfred Roller, who designed the opera's premiere production.This is the first time most of us will have witnessed the film accompanied live by 14 players in the salon arrangement, though sound and vision have long been available: the film on a DVD, not widely distributed, of the print used last night issued by Film Archiv Austria with the full Staatskapelle Dresden conducted by Frank Strobel, and the salon version, with a slightly different combination of instruments than the one assembled here by artistic director Thomas Kemp, as recorded by ensemble 13 baden-baden under Manfred Reichert (Strauss the conductor's 1926 selection from the opera is essentially a suite of operatic excerpts, though using an augmented version of the Tivoli Orchestra he had conducted for a London screening). I and other critics well remember holding up intertitles for a Crusaid event, also in the Queen Elizabeth Hall, in the early 1990s. The main point here, though, is that the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment worked their socks off for more than two hours in high style, perfectly synchronised in the vivacious conducting of Geoffrey Paterson. The pace, of course, tells us much about how briskly Strauss expected the score of Der Rosenkavalier to be taken. You couldn't grumble too much that little of the music other than the Presentation of the Rose fitted the purpose for which it was originally composed when there was such expressive beauty, not least from violinists Colin Scobie and Dominika Feher in such perfect accord.The pleasure taken in sound and spirit mitigated so many odd mismatches on Strauss's part: the Marschallin's black page boy never gets the ""right"" music, though he does appear, while the dialogue between Octavian and Sophie before the celebrated trio, luminously chamber-orchestrated here, serves an unlikely scene where the Count is still snogging the Marschallin even though he's pledged to Sophie (scene pictured above), to name but two examples.Wiene's faltering pace and jumping around different Viennese venues - good to see, of course - is mitigated by some fine if broad-brushstroked acting on screen. The master is the comic-relief Baron Ochs of Michael Bohnen, who actually sang the role and whose eyebrow-waggling puts one in mind of a plump Spike Milligan. Our introduction to him on his run-down country estate includes a witty introduction of his favourite waltz on a hurdy-gurdy (harmonium on stage). Taking a good lesson in comedy is Jaque Catelain as Octavian - yes, a young man rather than a mezzo, which actually makes the comedy of cross-dressing as maid Mariandel (Catelain pictured below with Bohnen) rather funny. Least well served by the film version is the Marschallin, shorn of her wider meditations on the passing of time; all Huguette Duflos has to do is be permanently on the point of fainting. Her husband the Feldmarschall, absent in the opera, gets a big part in the handsome personage of Paul Hartmann, though that entails a pointless battle scene for which Wiene must have blown a huge budget on a superfluous few minutes.There are some witty Hogarthian touches - the Commission for Morality, for instance, a cluster of wigs - and though the eighth reel is missing, the 2006 reconstruction made it possible for the extant music to be played with some visual hints, and allows the last three minutes of the opera its head.It was generous of the OAE to give us a bonus - the four early songs Strauss composed as a wedding present for Pauline de Ahna, plus - odd idea - the Presentation of the Rose as Music Minus One, with Sophie's part but not Octavian's. Could they not have brought in a promising mezzo from one of the London colleges?No matter when Charlotte Beament (pictured right) made such radiant sense of it all, soaring above inappropriately crude chamber arrangements of the songs' orchestral writing by Arnold Wilke (really, a piano and timpani at the start of ""Ruhe, meine Seele""? Doubled lines for the violin solo of ""Morgen""?) Here is yet another world-class lyric soprano from the British stable, following close on the heels of Louise Alder, whose Sophie I'll be seeing in the revival of Richard Jones's Glyndebourne Rosenkavalier on Sunday. As an interesting parergon or side work last night's oddity certainly whetted the appetite for the real thing. And let's not forget the appropriateness of the glib happy ending, in contrast to the opera, for this weekend: the Prince and Princess live happily ever after, and even the scandalmonger/paparazza finds a mate to join in the fun.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music-film-opera/rosenkavalier-film-oae-paterson-qeh-review-silent-era-muddle-expertly,4
36,"Lessons in Love and Violence, Royal Opera review - savage elegance never quite glows red-hot",Lessons in Love and Violence,Royal Opera,2018-05-11,alexandra Coghlan,"A rope is mercy; a razor-blade to the throat, a kiss; a red-hot poker… But, of course, we never get anything so literal as the poker in George Benjamin and Martin Crimp’s elegant, insinuating retelling of Christopher Marlowe’s Edward II. The title may separate its two concepts – Lessons in Love and Violence – but what we’re really unpicking here (what we’re always unpicking with these two authors) is the fleshy tangle of the two, the stubbornly indivisible, Roger McGough-style loveandviolence.This is an opera built on the sliding panels of elision, metaphor and metonymy – a shifting world where a kiss can be a betrayal, and a caress a murder, where taking away a man’s name or his crown can deprive him of his life. Symbolism is a high-stakes game, and no one plays it better, or with more rigorous control than Benjamin and Crimp.For over a decade now, and over the course of three collaborations, the composer and playwright have been teaching us their lessons – serving up operatic parables on power, politics, desire and the darkest urges of human nature to audiences that suddenly swelled from the fringe enthusiasts of 2006’s Into the Little Hill to the crowds that have claimed 2012’s Written On Skin as one of the greatest successes of 21st century opera – seen already in six different stagings internationally since its premiere.But if the stage-contexts for these pieces have grown in size and stature (Lessons in Love is a co-commission from seven opera houses, including Madrid, Barcelona and Chicago), the works themselves have scarcely changed. The same chamber precision, restraint and cogency that makes Into the Little Hill so effective are still in evidence here, and in a world of diffuse, often wilfully undramatic new operas it’s both a relief and a thrill to watch this taut, 100-minute show which has TV’s instinct for getting out of a scene fast.Cast in an arch of seven discrete episodes, the story of King Edward, his gay lover Gaveston (pictured above: Stephane Degout and Gyula Orendt), his neglected queen Isabel and her would-be-lover Mortimer, plays out as a series of taut emotional tableaux. Three murders, two political coups, a deposition and a betrayal give the opera plenty of meat, but this isn’t a piece that’s interested in doing. If music is, famously, the space between the notes, then Benjamin and Crimp have devised a drama that lives between the scenes. The spare, suggestive beauty of Crimp’s libretto and Benjamin’s music (which never states when it can imply, never implies where it can simply leave a dramatic door ajar) leaves room for the audience, and having been invited into their cruel world it’s almost impossible to leave.One major change has taken place since Skin. The third-person narration – the arch, arms-length, meta-theatricality that Crimp’s detractors take issue with – has gone. Storytelling has become a more straightforward transaction (though, perhaps still thinking more than it feels), and Benjamin’s musical language has responded in turn with a more sustained, string-based lyricism that could be described as sensuous were it not so coldly, forbiddingly beautiful – a Nicole Kidman of scores.The uncanny, booming sound of the cimbalom – part-percussion, part-human voice – is back (having previously defined the soundworld of Little Hill), now accompanied by thrumming drums and harps – an exotic, rhythmic signature for Gaveston, agent here of both love and death. But if Gaveston’s thrusts are violent, unpredictable, there’s also a more deliberate rhythmic pulse at work here. Crimp’s obsession with the “machine” of state politics finds echo in music that ticks and clicks and – devastatingly – stutters and stops altogether on the word “dead” during the king’s assassination. Raging against that machine with every coaxing bar he sings, Gaveston (sung with an enchanter’s skill by Gyula Orendt, pictured above, with Degout and Samuel Boden as The Young King) stills and suspends time, creating its own seductive temporality.Lessons reunites not only Benjamin and Crimp but also Skin’s director Katie Mitchell and designer Vicki Mortimer. The result is exactly as you’d expect: a slick contemporary monarchy framed in Elle Decoration interiors, tricked out with the usual Mitchell ticks (slow-motion movement, silent onlookers, meticulous psychological detail). If you thought a new dramatic approach from Benjamin and Crimp might yield a new response from the director, then think again.The cast list reads like a dream, and it’s one sustained in performance. Stephane Degout’s King – pliant, almost womanish in scenes with Orendt’s Gaveston (Benjamin doing here for male-voice duets what Strauss did for female), but quietly authoritative elsewhere – holds the centre, orbited by Barbara Hannigan’s brittle Isabel (whose horrid-beautiful pearl aria is a highlight), Samuel Boden’s Young King, caught between innocence and pitiless purity, and Peter Hoare’s Mortimer (pictured above) – wild-eyed but horribly sane in his actions, spinning even the most grotesque logic into plausible, lovely phrases.Benjamin himself conducts a large orchestra, whose full force is (once again) only heard in the interludes between scenes – a loud, public intrusion into an essentially private drama that takes a political story and plays it out psychologically. Benjamin’s body politic is warm to the touch, stripped bare and left bruised and twitching by the end. There is no poker here because the authors have found a far more devastating, savage weapon: love itself. “Love makes us human,” the King asserts. “So,” corrects Mortimer, “does the need to kill.”@alexacoghlan",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/lessons-love-and-violence-royal-opera-review-savage-elegance-never-quite-glows-red-hot,4
37,"Eugene Onegin, Scottish Opera review - sweepingly sumptuous Tchaikovsky",Eugene Onegin,Scottish Opera,2018-04-28,Miranda Heggie,"It’s 25 years since Tchaikovsky’s Eugene Onegin last came to the Scottish Opera stage, and this brand new production, directed by Oliver Mears, DIrector of Opera at The Royal Opera, gives the stirring score a stately yet elusive grandeur. Based on Alexander Pushkin’s verse-novel of the same name, this tale of unrequited love set against the trappings of class and duty is rooted well within the literary and musical traditions of 19th century Russia, yet easy to immerse oneself in today.The story is told within the context of female lead Tatyana’s memories from days gone by. Dancer, choreographer and teacher Rosy Sanders plays a version of Tatyana as an old lady, who silently steals through the shadows as she watches the tribulations of her younger self and her sister Olga. Making her Scottish Opera debut, designer Annemarie Woods’s set is therefore deliberately dilapidated, with dusty broken chairs and a mosaic floor and long window shutters that echo faded grandeur (pictured below: Natalya Romaniw as Tatyana in Act III). The chorus are, for the most part, behind a thinly veiled curtain at the back of the stage, and this, combined with Fabiana Picioli’s ingenious lighting design – another debut with the company – makes for a staging that’s atmospherically nostalgic.Baritone Samuel Dale Johnson in the title role makes a grand entrance, riding on stage on a horse – yes, an actual horse, which, with perfect comic timing, promptly relieved itself on stage last night, much to the hilarity of many members of the audience. It certainly didn’t dampen Johnson’s dignity, however. He gives an assured performance as the lofty, supercilious Onegin. Soprano Natalya Romaniw is stunning in the role of Tatyana. She sings of her character’s newly discovered love and longing for Onegin with a teetering balance of chaste, blissful innocence and deep sensuality, with supple vocal control.Act II begins at a ball, to celebrate Tatyana’s name-day. The chorus, dressed in black, twirl gracefully in couples, still behind the curtain. If one were to nit-pick, the dancing needed to be tighter and more uniform for the silhouette effect to really work. It’s a slight criticism though, and certainly one which pales into comparison when considering the chorus’s mighty vocal prowess displayed throughout the work.Mezzo-soprano Sioned Gwen Davies is charming as Tatyana's coquettish sister Olga, and Peter Auty gives a magnetic depth to the character of her fiance Lensky. From his bright and lively entrance in Act I to his hot-headed jealousy in Act II, Auty portrays Lensky’s ardent passions with vocal magnitude and a captivating stage presence. His brooding duet as he contemplates his and Onegin’s upcoming duel is rich and heartfelt, with beautifully bubbling obligati from clarinet and oboe. A host of flickering pillar candles of varying sizes gives a warm glow to the stage for the start of Act III. Johnson plays a now downtrodden and dishevelled Onegin as he laments the shooting of his friend (pictured above). Though the character here has lost the grand stature of his earlier incarnation, vocally this act is where Johnson is at his strongest. His solo singing is rich and resplendent, and his impassioned duet passages with Romaniw tender yet fraught with emotion. Romaniw’s Tatyana here too is transformed from a bookish, youthful country girl to a self-assured aristocrat, but her singing has the same depth, colour and strength throughout. She really is tremendous in this role, taking the audience with her on Tatyana’s emotional journey, through her first discoveries of love, the pain of her rejection, and her ultimate sacrifice of choosing moral duty over her own desires.The sounds from the pit were as fervent and passionate as those from the stage. The Scottish Opera orchestra, under Music Director Stuart Stratford, gave a strong performance with high emotional intensity. From poignantly illustrating Tatyana’s sorrows in the first act, they played the dance music at the start of Act II with warmth, but still with zest, and the flurry of strings in the duel scene was anxious and startling. They may not always have been as tightly together as they could have been, but what they lacked in uniformity they more than made up for in animation, vigour and moving musicality.@mirandabags",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/eugene-onegin-scottish-opera-review-sweepingly-sumptuous-tchaikovsky,5
38,"4.48 Psychosis, Royal Opera, Lyric Hammersmith review - despairing truth in song and speech",4.48 Psychosis,Royal Opera,2018-04-26,David Nice,"Depression, with or without psychotic episodes, is a rare subject for drama or music theatre - and with good reason: the sheer unrelenting monotony of anguish and self-absorption is hard to reproduce within a concentrated time-span. So we still stand in awe of Sarah Kane for the way she managed, months before her suicide, to wring from the depths and write in blood such a kaleidoscopic range of despair and black vision in 4.48 Psychosis; in awe, too, of composer Philip Venables, for finding an equal variety, and an even greater eclecticism, in the musical voices to tell a drama of pain that is anything but general. This, its first revival since 2016, proves that it's one of only two new or recent works produced under Kasper Holten's Royal Opera aegis - the other is Gerald Barry's The Importance of Being Earnest - that's here to stay.Masterpiece or not, 4.48 Psychosis the opera is a very rare case of the music reflecting what could be an overpowering text at every point. Kane's words by themselves will always be the richer option because of their total authenticity, even in the occasional bathos and banality. Some of Venables' sequences sound a bit more generic - the slow-burn meshing of his six female voices, for instance, brilliant idea though it was to have them represent aspects of the undoubted protagonist, sufferer, patient, call her what you will - the utterly convincing Gweneth-Ann Rand (pictured above), as before. Others add a layer to Kane's writing and can be hair-raising, not least the fast passages involving numbers and lists; difficult to catch all the amplified words here when they're not flashed up as text on the back wall, but the fizzing textures are the thing, with bending string lines and shrieking woodwind (flute/piccolo and three saxophones), Birtwistle-style, from the hard-working CHROMA under Richard Baker.The visionary hour around 4.48am inspires music for a black-and-white mass. Most riveting of all is the dialogue between (we assume) patient and psychiatrist which launches the work - as a monologue since one of the two remains silent - and is, perhaps, its only developmental strand. CHROMA's two percussionists, Louise Goodwin (pictured above), beat out the speech-rhythms on bass drum and other hard-hitting instruments against dribbling recorded muzak while the text is seen below. It's as if the protagonist is under water in her isolation, and barely hearing properly; towards the end, mezzo Lucy Schaufer begins to articulate the psychiatrist's words. It's moving; there is professional help here, but the main character (Kane, surely) is beyond it.It's not always easy to work out who's singing what; given the non-directional miking and the darker lighting in D.M. Wood's palette on Hannah Clark's set, but Susanna Hurrell excels as a more companionable self and there's fine ensemble work from newcomers to the production - I presume, since the characters' names seem to be those of the original singers - Lucy Hall, Samantha Price and Rachel Lloyd. Director Ted Huffman overcomes the problem of a specific location for a totally unspecific text - a room with a glass door, table and chairs - by drawing variety parallel to Kane and Venables from his team and video designer Pierre Martin. Not easy listening and watching, then, but decidedly a confirmation of a classic.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/448-psychosis-royal-opera-lyric-hammersmith-review-despairing-truth-song-and-speech,4
39,"The Marriage of Figaro, English Touring Opera review - vanilla Mozart still tastes sweet",The Marriage of Figaro,English Touring Opera,2018-04-26,Richard Bratby,"The Fates did not want theartsdesk to review English Touring Opera’s new production of The Marriage of Figaro. The Beast from the East intervened to prevent a colleague from covering it at the Hackney Empire at the start of its tour in February: now, eight weeks and eight venues further on, altogether more mundane problems (for Midlands based readers, ‘M42’ will be sufficient explanation) meant that by the time I took my seat at the Cheltenham Everyman, we were already well into Act 1 and Ross Ramgobin’s Figaro was breaking out some martial arts moves to the closing bars of ""Se vuol ballare"".Does that matter? It needs to be asked, because Mozart and Da Ponte’s comic opera is so perfectly weighted, so lightly and exquisitely sprung, that every note counts. It’s often possible to tell whether a performance of The Marriage of Figaro is going to fly or flop before the end of the overture, and the way Figaro and Susanna respond to each other in the first minutes after the curtain goes up can seal the deal. And yet these characters are so engaging and the world Mozart and Da Ponte create is so real that however late you arrive, as a rule you’re just glad to be there. All opinions that follow, however, come with the qualification that one piece of the jigsaw might be missing.And of course, it wasn’t strictly speaking Se vuol ballare that I interrupted – the production was sung in English, in Jeremy Sams’s boisterous rhyming couplets. That’s usually a sound decision in a comedy, and with the cast projecting clearly and audibly (judging from seats in the back and front stalls, anyway), the jokes landed and the cast was able to play off the laughter of a capacity audience. Which is just as well, because – without doing anything that would startle traditionalists – director Blanche McIntyre plays the piece principally for laughs. Costumes are standard issue 1780s, with just the merest hint of the surreal. Count Almaviva’s outsize peruke suggests a coxcomb in more ways than one, while Neil Irish’s flat, folding interior set designs have the air, if not of a cartoon exactly, then certainly of illustrations in a children’s book.That makes an appropriate setting for a cast that’s been chosen for stage presence and ensemble rapport rather than megawatt voices. This was Figaro as a chamber piece, without a chorus but with a full orchestra which, under Christopher Stark, played with style and warmth at tempos that made the drama glow rather than fizz. McIntyre’s direction, too, was leisurely. In Acts One and Two we saw rather a lot of characters standing about and metaphorically twiddling their thumbs (the Countess - played by Nadine Benjamin, pictured above - simply positioned herself behind her chaise longue and delivered ""Porgi amor"" straight at the audience), though things seemed to pull more sharply into focus after the interval.Which is not to say that there wasn’t some deft characterisation throughout. Ramgobin (pictured below, left) demonstrated his comic chops in entertainingly louche style in last season’s Patience: his Figaro was a cheerful, up-for-it Jack the Lad, whose knowing shrugs and raised eyebrows drolly filled out the persona sketched by his pleasant light baritone. He delivered his recitatives with delicious comic timing, over some sparky continuo playing, and hit the deck and started doing push-ups during ""Non piu andrai"". As Susanna, Rachel Redmond stopped just short of running away (as Susannas sometimes can) with the whole show. Her sunny, chiming coloratura and graceful phrasing complemented an affectionate performance. And as with all the best Figaro ensembles, the central pair illuminated and reflected the characters around them. Dawid Kimberg’s (pictured below, right) ramrod straight Count (his roaming hands were the only uncontrolled thing about him) seemed even more unbending and vocally chilly besides this Figaro, while next to Redmond’s lightly worn vocal poise, Benjamin’s creamy tone acquired a noticeably fraught edge at moments of emotional pressure. It was a nice touch to have a Cherubino (Katherine Aitken, pictured above) who was every bit as gangly and cocksure as his master, and practically luxury casting to have Gaynor Keeble as a determinedly youthful and flirtatious Marcellina – one whose voice blended so sweetly with Redmond’s that the notion that both women might be serious contenders for Figaro’s hand seemed, for once, almost plausible.That’s essentially it. There were no tricks; the alarums and excursions in Act Four’s nocturnal garden played out clearly and amusingly; the character roles – most notably Devon Harrison’s bluff cockney Antonio (pictured above, left), and Abigail Kelly as a Barbarina who was nobody’s wide eyed innocent – were sharply drawn. And at that sublime moment in Act Four where the Countess steps forward to forgive and Mozart’s score brims over with compassion, I felt that all-important pricking behind the eyes: the unfailing indicator that a Figaro has hit its mark. There are bigger, starrier and more complex stagings out there: productions that are faster, sassier and considerably darker. But it’s useful to be reminded that a straightforward vanilla Marriage of Figaro, performed with wit and a good heart, is still pretty much the best night out you could possibly hope for.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/marriage-figaro-english-touring-opera-review-vanilla-mozart-still-tastes-sweet,3
40,"Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, Royal Opera review - bleak rigour and black comedy still cast a spell",Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk,Royal Opera,2018-04-13,David Nice,"Anyone who's seen Richard Jones's rigorous production before will remember the makeover – Katerina Izmailova, bored and brutalised housewife released by sex and murder from her shackles, having her drab bedroom expanded and redecorated in deliberate incongruity with Shostakovich's most shattering orchestral music – and its polar opposite, the near-black horror of convicts in trucks by the river on their way to Siberia. The overall focus and ironic symmetries are still there, if not some of the fine tuning, an amazing 14 years on from the first airing, and even though Eva-Maria Westbroek's was never a pretty sound – no need for that here – this committed singer-actor has survived the soprano-wrecking propensities of the title role unscathed.If Jones had been there this time round – he's in Paris rehearsing his first Parsifal, leaving the Covent Garden revival to Elaine Kidd – one or two of the performances might have been a bit tighter. Delighted as we are that John Tomlinson celebrates his 40th year performing with the Royal Opera, his repulsive father-in-law seemed surprisingly approximate this time round; Jones would have disciplined him, surely (pictured below, Tomlinson's Boris makes a surprise appearance from beyond the grave at Katerina's wedding). Otherwise, the tics, manners and frozen postures keep every scene alive to match the chameleonic music, from the way that Katerina's left leg, heel off the ground, lags behind the right to represent her ennui, through the virtuoso choral groupings of the police station and party scenes – what other director would have the chorus reflect so meticulously a purely orchestral upside-down fugue before the voices come in? – to Katya's silent scream against blaring extra brass and the deadly stillness of her going lower than she ever thought possible in the denouement.It's all connected, of course – the containers for the convicts mirror the battered metal cabinets out of which strapping worker Sergey crawls to seduce the merchant's wife, and in which the unfortunate teacher suspected of being an anarchist is trapped. In the Izmailov household there are no windows, only doors at which people are constantly listening; the split stage of the drabbest interior allows for enlargement of one of the rooms in the makeover and eventually morphs into a full party scene, a joyless affair somewhere behind the iron curtain in the 1970s, with nowhere for Katya to run, and finally a near-lightless open space for the last act. Designs by the true artist John Macfarlane, costumes and lighting by Jones regulars Nicky Gillibrand and Mimi Jordan Sherin, all play their part in a perfectly-fused whole.The visual endgame is as daringly bleak and frozen an equivalent to Shostakovich's hopeless music as you'll ever see on the operatic stage (though Dmitri Tcherniakov's daring negation of the open-steppes choruses in a single grubby prison cell at English National Opera was also striking). Even the blue stockings of Katerina's dowdy first incarnation make a telling reappearance.Westbroek (pictured right with Brandon Jovanovich's Sergey) totally inhabits the frustration, later the stillness and a more desperate kind of isolation, moving chillingly against her new wallpaper as she realises that her new husband is never going to be really with her, leaving her alone with the ghost of the old man she murdered, and absolutely at one with Antonio Pappano's quiet intensity in the final monologues. The Royal Opera's hard-working Music Director doesn't go for quite the deep sound achieved by Mark Wigglesworth, the supreme interpreter of this music, at ENO, but the shadings are subtle, the woodwind in caricature appropriately shrill and the blasts of the brass band, very involved in the action in a way that Shostakovich would surely have loved, spine-tingling.Chief newcomer here is tall and handsome American tenor Brandon Jovanovich; even though Shostakovich never writes lovely music for him, you can tell the sound is rock-solid and gleaming bright as befits the new Siegmund of choice. John Daszak, asked to play husband Zinovy as straight as possible, heads effectively towards a Tarantinoesque fate. There are laughs for his despatch, but they're stilled by the end of the act; would that Jones's Verdi Macbeth, with similar strip-cartoon antics involving a severed head, had been running in tandem with the Shostakovich at the Royal Opera rather than the relatively anodyne production which keeps coming round (kudos to Pappano, though, for conducting the two operas back to back). Peter Bronder's horrid Shabby Peasant works brilliantly alongside Rosie Aldridge's Aksinya in retrieving Zinovy's body (the two, pictured above showing their find to Mikhail Svetlov's Police Inspector) – another of Jones's bright ideas – while Svetlov's vengeful official, a bass in good form as, sadly, Paata Burchuladze no longer is as the Old Convict, and Aigul Akhmetshina as Katya's more seductive rival on the road to Siberia execute their quirky routines very well. The chorus needed to work more closely with Pappano on the first night, but should tighten up over the run. If you haven't seen the production, go and be constantly surprised or shocked; if you have, you'll probably be amazed by the sharp and creepy detail you missed first time round.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/lady-macbeth-mtsensk-royal-opera-review-bleak-rigour-and-black-comedy-still-cast-spell,4
41,"Bernstein's MASS, RFH review - polymorphousness in excelsis",Bernstein's MASS,RFH,2018-04-07,David Nice,"Live exposure to centenary composer Leonard Bernstein's anything-goes monsterpiece of 1971, as with Britten's War Requiem of the previous decade, probably shouldn't happen more than once every ten years, if only because each performance has to be truly special. It's been nearly eight since Marin Alsop last conducted and Jude Kelly directed MASS at the Southbank Centre. The new era of Barack Obama still had an early-days sheen then. No-one could have imagined when this similar-but-different spectacular was planned how its vital youth component - not just among the singers but also in an orchestra of 11 to 18 year olds - would chime so tear-jerkingly with the anti-NRA crusaders we've seen take flight in the past month.Now, it seems, the world as a whole is closer to the collective breakdown characterised by Bernstein's constantly widening rift between the Latin words of the Christian Mass - many of them pre-recorded, in quadraphonic sound at the premiere - and the vernacular response which ranges from the desperate will to believe through cynicism and anger to rejection. Should it be an entirely American issue? As before, Kelly gives us images from the time of hope in JFK onwards, stylishly incorporated on screen canvasses by designer Michael Vale. They bring us as up to the minute as we can get; there is sight for one moment of the American Horror-Clown in Chief as the visuals rapidly fast-forward, and it is meant to pierce us, just when the crisis reaches its overwhelming zenith (caution: ear plugs needed, if only for three minutes). Given the specific framework, which involves one Groundhog Day return to flower-power ritual, I wonder how much the children and young adults this time connected with our own rift, where resistance isn't nearly as strong as it is in the States. But they certainly put their hearts and souls into the performance. It’s not the most precise or focused in its punch you’ll ever hear, but unless you fold your arms in response to Bernstein’s unusual openness, you can’t help but be moved.This time the colossal role of the Celebrant, worn down by confrontational questioning to a tricky 14-minute nervous breakdown Bernstein calls “Fraction"" and which surely owes something to Peter Grimes' mad scene, is taken by Paulo Szot (pictured above centre), born in Brazil to Polish émigré parents. He has what the part takes but rarely gets: an operatic baritone of warmth and power matched to the natural intensity of a show singer (his award-winning performance in South Pacific on Broadway really put him on the American map; he's found more often today singing Mozart). Rightly the vociferous-at-the-end but attentive audience reflecting the diversity on stage – where the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain shared desks with players from the junior division of Chineke!, the pioneer of Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) players in classical music – went wildest for him. There was also huge enthusiasm for, and from, the ensemble of music-theatre students who make up the “Street People” (pictured above). It’s always a shame that you don’t find out who sings what there; Bernstein has some great music for them, including the poignant soprano solo “Thank you” and some properly rocked “tropes”, all charismatically taken. They also get the most striking lines, a quatrain given to Bernstein as a Christmas present by Paul Simon: “Half of the people are stoned/And the other half are waiting for the next election./Half the people are drowned/And the other half are swimming in the wrong direction.” Though wordwise the rest, by Bernstein and Steven Schwartz of Godspell fame, is rarely on the same level, the music fits it and everything's still topical; you only had to look at this bunch of young hopefuls to think of their schoolroom counterparts marching for gun control across the pond (heck, one boy even looked a bit like Parklander David Hogg).Among the 500 performers, also including spirited diverse choirs coached by the now-ubiquitous Mary King, the dancers probably had the least good deal: their routines don’t chime with the very non-dancey orchestral interludes, where you really wanted to concentrate on the faces of the young players instead. But there was some deep and impassioned string playing – not easy for half the orchestra to see Alsop on the other side of the stage when visually blocked by the Street People on the central platform – and from the bluesy “voice from heaven” of the flutes in the initial “Simple Song” to the clarinets keeping the lonely Celebrant company, the woodwind playing always impressed. The three children taking up those initial “laudes” in the final road to recovery – Maia Greaves, Freddie and Leo Jemison (pictured above) – almost made me blub. Yes, it’s a sentimental apotheosis, but not mawkish; Bernstein now brings keening lines into the initially serene picture, and as in War Requiem there’s a calm final chorus (though without Britten’s last question mark). It's not so far from the ancient Greek theatre's ""let us cry sorrow, sorrow, but let the good prevail"". The Celebrant has picked himself up, dusted himself down and is ready to start all over again – but changed. Emotionally exhausted, we feel the same, if only for a while. Bravi tutti, and let's hear it for the achievements of the Jude Kelly era. One of her earliest London hits was a memorable production of Bernstein's On the Town at English National Opera, and it's appropriate that she should take her creative leave of the Southbank with a signature work highlighting the special good she's done here.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music-opera/bernsteins-mass-rfh-review-polymorphousness-excelsis,5
42,"Coraline, Royal Opera, Barbican review - spooky story, underwhelming score",Coraline,Royal Opera,2018-04-05,David Nice,"With the eyes of musical fashion turned relentlessly on the calculating stage works of chilly alchemist George Benjamin, hopes ran high for a brighter spark in a new opera by his contemporary Mark-Anthony Turnage. Would Coraline, a music-drama for children of all ages based on the celebrated story by Neil Gaiman, burst into flames like Greek and the last two acts of The Silver Tassie or continue the elegiac strand in the best of Anna Nicole? Alas, no: despite the dedicated musicianship and the nifty staging of Aletta Collins, no-one is going to come out of this two-hour immersion fired up or much moved.Still, the run is sold out. I suspect that's less to do with Turnage than with literary megastar Gaiman. His novella - inexplicably not on sale at the Barbican, or I'd have bought a copy - has the kind of imaginative scariness as its premise that hooks young readers. 11-year-old Coraline finds a way in to a parallel universe where ""Other Mother"" offers her everything she wants, but in exchange needs to sew the buttons she and ""Other Father"" sport on to the girl's eyes (Alexander Robin Baker, Kitty Whately and alternative-cast Coraline Mary Bevan pictured below). It's not so much Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There as Hansel and Gretel, in Humperdinck's operatic version of which some productions favour doubling Mother and Witch (when the latter's not sung by a tenor). The two operas/children's stories share the same idea of enticements lacking at home - in the Grimm opera's case as much candy as you can eat - with the same deadly threat beneath the sugar. Turnage doesn't really rise to the horror. As in The Silver Tassie, there's a doomy language at work from the start which needs more turns of the screw once Coraline goes through the dangerous door; a slight twist in unisons between low and high woodwind isn't quite enough. The chamber scoring shows a master's hand, with superb writing for oboe, cor anglais and bass clarinet especially, but the substance is less than memorable. There are only so many off-kilter pastiche tangos and waltzes a listener can take. And I suspect children need something more punchy, like Glyndebourne Youth Opera's vibrant adaptation of Janne Teller's novel for young adults Nothing, To make the neighbours interesting before the ""real"" story begins, for instance, the music should go up a fantastical notch or two. Though Gillian Keith and Frances McCafferty do what they can as retired thesps, and Harry Nicoll's Lithuanian Mr Bobo has strong visual context in which to tell Coraline about his mouse orchestra, the sounds of both scenes don't take off (Nicoll and McCafferty pictured below with Whately and Bevan).At least Turnage's setting of Rory Mullarkey's libretto is reasonably engaging, and nearly every word can be heard in fine balance with the chamber ensemble under Sian Edwards (who conducted the world premiere of Turnage's Greek three decades ago). We missed the opening in the run-up to Easter; one compensation was to catch a rising star in the title role less well-known than natural stage animal Mary Bevan, who sings in six of the nine performance. Robyn Allegra Parton, due to make her role debut as Zerbinetta in Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos at Longborough this summer, is no light soprano; she can really push the intensity of Coraline's discontent, yearning and sadness (which is also where the score begins to work some magic). She's convincingly youthful, though whether you buy into this being an 11 year old who still plays with dolls is another matter. Last night we also heard a second mezzo singing the two Mothers from a score at  the side of the stage while a vocally indisposed Kitty Whately acted it all out to perfection on stage. Harriet Williams did a fine job, though all eyes were, as they should be, on Whately, a charismatic presence as both ""good"" and ""bad"" mums.Alexander Robin Baker invests what he can in the slightly underwritten role of the real-life inventor dad and the dispensible figure in the other world, while Dominic Sedgwick completes the trio of Ghost Children, given not quite enough free musical rein in a scene carried by its design. So the cast of seven does a good job. Giles Cadle's series of peculiar rooms make for a series of agile scene changes, though the work of the two ""magic consultants"" is a little underwhelming. As, I'm sorry to say, is the opera as a whole. Thanks to the subject matter, though, and its fine execution, you won't be bored.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/coraline-royal-opera-barbican-review-spooky-story-underwhelming-score,3
43,"The Marriage of Figaro, English National Opera review - sassy, probing and splendidly cast",The Marriage of Figaro,English National Opera,2018-03-30,Jessica Duchen,"One year to Brexit, a seemingly endless winter chill and Londoners need soul food, badly. I prescribe an evening of total immersion in The Marriage of Figaro. ENO’s second revival of Fiona Shaw’s sassy, probing production (with revival director Peter Relton) is splendidly cast, warmly performed and chock-full of delights.It’s finely paced, varied, and sound of dramatic judgment, as well as full of detail – the character vignettes in the chorus are a treat. The palace’s many walls in Peter McKintosh’s set often whirl (we’ve got a revolve and we’re gonna use it!), yet never too much. It’s fresh and often laugh-out-loud funny, yet with a ferocious cruelty lurking just under the surface, as witnessed by the bullfight skulls, the weapons, the Count’s leather belt wielded against the unfortunate Cherubino. And Jeremy Sams’s translation bubbles and bounces. “You gaudy old parakeet!” – Susanna to Marcellina – is quite an improvement on “sibilla decrepita”.Shaw excavates the work’s power structures with sharp eyes and merciless vision. The Count, big and slightly dim, is a brute under his seductiveness, though with a strong dose of Monty Python thrown in; the last scene reduces him almost to the Ministry of Silly Walks in his underpants. Susanna and the Countess run rings around him; even when Susanna mixes up her “yes” and “no” in their duet, she is not flustered, but enjoying a joke at his expense. Yet there is real pain and danger in their world. And this is the one where the Countess gets away. So often, elsewhere, one wishes she would indeed pack her bags and walk away into the night, head held high. The problem is that the playwright Beaumarchais, librettist da Ponte and, above all, Mozart knew in that final scene of forgiveness that human nature is not that rational. That’s why the opera rings so desperately true. We wonder how far she will get before turning back.All eyes and ears for opening night were on the cast, many of whom are young singers in their role debuts. First of all, the ensemble works so beautifully that you have the feeling the performers are loving every moment of it. The cast of voices is well matched and beautifully balanced; perhaps a little more contrast of timbre would not have gone amiss, as Janis Kelly’s Marcellina is light-toned and Katie Coventry’s Cherubino not too dark either, but that is maybe splitting hairs. Most are British, which will please those who feel that nurturing British talent is part of ENO’s prime mission statement – and they do not disappoint.Welsh soprano Rhian Lois, one of the current ENO Harewood Artists, in her role debut as Susanna, seems born for the part, her voice vivid with clear diction and a touching sweetness in her solo moments. Bass-baritone Ashley Riches (currently a BBC New Generation Artist) is an absolutely splendid Count, balancing the character’s strands – the seducer, the jealous husband, the vicious boss, the dolt – with some enjoyment and strong, beautiful tone that lives up to his name. Katie Coventry, also an ENO Harewood Artist, strikes just the right balance as Cherubino, beautifully musical and charming without being hammy (pictured above with Ashley Riches' Count poised to thrash and Rhian Lois's Susanna restraining him). Janis Kelly’s Marcellina (pictured above) and Colin Judson’s Don Basilio are both clear-toned, wonderful of diction and excellent of timing; the characters are stripped of their Act IV arias, which in dramatic terms is a relief – but for once one would love them to have a chance to shine. Keel Watson is an imposing Dr Bartolo and tenor Paul Sheehan makes the most of the tipsy gardener Antonio, with whose lines Sams has had some fun (“The man I saw wasn’t riding – I think I’d have noticed the horse”). And there’s a splendid ENO debut for Alison Rose as a Barbarina as tipsy as her dad; a young award-winning soprano, having scooped both the Maggie Teyte Prize and the Leonard Ingrams Award, Rose is definitely one to watch. As Figaro himself, Dutch baritone Thomas Oliemans is lively, charismatic and suitably sparkly.And our Countess is Lucy Crowe, the British soprano who so often seems to be everywhere, doing so many roles, that one might wonder if there are three of her. But she is developing and changing, and her tone proved distinctive, boasting a strong mix of creaminess, cut-through and a spot-on, pinging accuracy that’s always mellifluously phrased. Her first aria took a minute to settle, along with her characterisation, but thereafter she was simply outstanding. On the podium, Martyn Brabbins leads a generous, airy, subtle and joyous account of this heavenly score – without any pretention, rushing, non-vibrato point-proving or excess ego to get in its way. A few glitches of coordination and timing between singers and orchestra will doubtless settle beyond first night. Special plaudits to Chris Hopkins for his suave and sensitive continuo, uncredited in the programme.Some critics, in the wake of the recent disastrous new La traviata on this stage, saw fit to call for the closing down of the company. This Figaro makes an equally strong case for the exact opposite.@jessicaduchen",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/marriage-figaro-english-national-opera-review-sassy-probing-and-splendidly-cast,4
44,"Ariadne auf Naxos, Scottish Opera review - superb singing in slick new production",Ariadne auf Naxos,Scottish Opera,2018-03-27,Miranda Heggie,"""The Show must go on"". So say the posters dotted around Glasgow and Edinburgh for Scottish Opera's production of Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos. Except on Thursday, it didn’t. A fire at a nearby Glasgow nightclub which ravaged several city centre buildings caused the Theatre Royal to become so filled with smoke that the opening night’s performance had to be cancelled. Opening instead on Saturday, director and designer Antony McDonald’s new production, co-produced by Scottish Opera and Opera Holland Park, is witty and slick, with an unfussy stage design that nods to the period but has a modern context, without distracting from the music and the opera’s central themes.It’s a work that poses many questions about art’s place in society; its relevance, its merits and its ownership, to suggest but a few. With the second half an ""opera within an opera"", the piece begins with the Prologue, where preparations for an evening of entertainment at the mansion of the richest man in the city – on Saturday that city was Glasgow, though presumably that will move with the show – are well underway, and two groups of very different artists are getting ready to perform. The first will be performing a brand new opera, Ariadne auf Naxos, the second a burlesque/cabaret act, the toupe headed by their star performer Zerbinetta. Both bands of artists are disgruntled by the presence of the other, believing their work to be far superior. So unsurprisingly the instruction from their wealthy patron that due to time constraints, they must somehow merge the two performances into one show does not go down too well at all. The composer is distraught that this new opera, written specially for the occasion, will need to be compromised in such a way. She even insists that the work will not be performed, until her professor (sung by Sir Thomas Allen) reminds her of the handsome fee.Traditionally a trouser-role, soprano Julia Sporsén’s Composer (pictured above) is definitely female – and, refreshingly, not much of a big deal is made about this swap in gender. Nor in this production does it seem in the least out of the ordinary that her flirtatious duet with Zerbinetta later in the first act contains just the same level of sexual tension that’s usually reserved for on-stage heterosexual attraction. Musically, this duet was beautiful, with Sporsén and former Scottish Opera Emerging Artist Jennifer France as Zerbinetta producing a gorgeous blend, as the characters learn that despite coming from different walks of life, they may have more in common than they thought.Another subtle switch is the role of the Major-Domo, referred to in this production as ""Party-planner"". Actor Eleanor Bron gives a warm and engaging performance as the diplomatic but firm maneuverer, who skilfully manages the volatile egos of those around her.The second act is the opera itself, and it is sung in German, as opposed to the first half which was in English. Soprano Mardi Byers made her Scottish Opera debut as the princess Ariadne, stranded on a desert island after being abandoned by her lover. Byers has full command of this role, performing with a distinct regal poise and a beautifully rich, rounded tone. The three nymphs, sung by Elizabeth Cragg, Laura Zigmantaite and Lucy Hall, took a little while to find their niche during ensemble passages, though once they did the balance of voices worked well. Dutch tenor Kor-Jan Dusseljee was robust in the role of Bacchus, his love duet with Byers touching and compelling.Nevertheless it was France (pictured above) who stole the show, with the grand coloratura aria ""Großmächtige Prinzessin"" (""High and mighty princess"") which she delivered with impeccable vocal support and an impressive level of detail, filling the entire theatre.Another Scottish Opera debut came from conductor Brad Cohen. Under his baton the orchestral sounds were vivid and colourful, although not always completely in tune, with some wayward woodwind in the first half, and strings a little off in the second. It was only towards the end of the evening that the sounds from the pit began to really take off, with vibrant, spirited brass. The singing on offer, however, was very classy indeed, with some fabulous solo and duet performances throughout.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/ariadne-auf-naxos-scottish-opera-review-superb-singing-slick-new-production,4
45,"Hansel and Gretel, RNCM, Manchester review – an urban dream",Hansel and Gretel,RNCM,2018-03-19,Robert Beale,"Engelbert Humperdinck’s Hansel and Gretel is a ‘""fairytale opera"" (its composer’s description), and yet one characteristic frequently commented on is its ""Wagnerian"" scoring. For this production, with David Pountney’s English translation, the RNCM used Derek Clark’s reduced orchestration.Good idea, because the college has always been concerned that still-maturing voices should not be forced into trying to dominate massive orchestral sounds, and with that in mind has in recent years often provided surtitles for the audience to follow, even when the sung language was English. This time they didn’t do that, and I was concerned at first as to why. I think the answer may lie in the fact that Stephen Medcalf’s production – which has been created in collaboration with Grange Park Opera – doesn’t take the text particularly literally (though in spirit it’s spot-on). So it doesn’t actually matter too much whether you hear every word: the important thing is that you follow the parallel scenario. In the case of the cast I heard (there are two complete casts), Fiona Finsbury (Gretel), Rebecca Barry (Hansel) and Kimberley Raw (the Witch, pictured below) were excellent in diction, but the other principals had other virtues and all gave strong performances.So what’s the story this time? Well, we’re in the 1890s, when the piece was written – no clever update of the children’s adventure into a cyberspace one, as in Opera North’s recent version – and the family are clearly poor and living in urban squalor. Dad’s still a drunk, and mum, if she hasn’t given up altogether, is struggling. When the kids are sent out to scrounge (which they do with all the professionalism of the Artful Dodger among the city crowds), they’re in a ""forest"" of gaslamps, and that’s where they say their prayer and drop off to sleep as darkness falls.I wouldn’t have known it was meant to be Manchester if I hadn’t read the press release, but no matter: perhaps I should have realized that the name above the Witch’s little housey, here transformed into a sweets and pastry shop – Lecker – would be just right for one run by one of the many German émigrés in the Manchester of the late 19th century. Is the rest supposed to be a dream? Perhaps it is, as the Witch’s Konditorei, emerging from nowhere, transforms – and this really is a coup de théâtre – into a magnified version of the one-room home the children started off in (like in Cats, the larger-than-lifesize sets make you enter another world).Designer Yannis Thavoris, who also did wonders for the RNCM’s Cendrillon last December, has created this masterly effect. The opera’s moral lesson, sung first by Gretel and finally by everyone, that ""When in need or dark despair, God will always hear your prayer"", is first seen as a sampler above the fireplace of the children’s home – which is of course a very good place for sober thoughts when red-hot danger lurks beneath...Thavoris also provides a small army of gaslamp lighters for the outdoor scene, with glimmering ends to their poles like glow-worms – and who later turn into guardian angels, as we see from woolly wings sewn on their backs. The Sandman is a strange and foreign-looking pipe-smoker (not sure where that leaves the fairy dust he provides to close children’s eyes for sleep), and the Dew Fairy is a morning milkman from ""Dew Farm Dairy"". True to the original, at the end the Witch is changed into a gingerbread biscuit from which all the unenchanted children can take a bite.But this urban reimagining all has the same sentimental warmth as the original – and that is true of the re-orchestration, too. In the overture, Anthony Kraus unfolded its survey of the opera’s themes with dreamy richness and gradually pumped up the liveliness quotient so we knew it was all going to be OK in the end, and the RNCM Opera Orchestra played with refinement and beauty – a trifle thin and raucous in the tuttis, but that’s probably a result of the adaptation’s thinning the instrumentation down, anyway.The principals all acquitted themselves well. I heard Eliza Boom as the Mother, Matthew Nuttall as the Father, Rhiain Taylor as the Sandman and Stephanie Poropat as the Dew Fairy – but I must particularly praise Fiona Finsbury and Rebecca Barry in the lead roles. They sang beautifully, had completely mastered some complicated choreography and movement (creative credit there to Bethan Rhys Wiliam), and characterised and enunciated like seasoned troupers. And, checking their CVs, which include the big roles in Cendrillon too, I guess they already are.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/hansel-and-gretel-rncm-manchester-review-%E2%80%93-urban-dream,4
46,"La traviata, English National Opera review - into a vortex of ineptitude",La traviata,English National Opera,2018-03-17,David Nice,"You don't have to be a good director to manage the artistic side of an opera house. Daniel Kramer arrived at ENO and boosted morale at a time when company relations with then-CEO Cressida Pollock had hit rock bottom, and his repertoire choices for the new limited seasons look fine so far. But auguries for what publicity proclaims his ""first opera as ENO Artistic Director"" were not good given the two operas he'd previously staged in the Coliseum: Bluebeard's Castle as Fritzl's basement, stuck with that one idea, and Tristan and Isolde with an ill-conceived first act stylistically different from the other two. Neither could have prepared us for a Traviata which commits just about every directorial clumsiness in the book as Verdi's perfect score struggles to stay afloat.Hopes ran higher for soprano Claudia Boyle, a stylish Mabel in the Mike Leigh Pirates of Penzance (yes, that needs dazzling coloratura, too). She'd probably fit perfectly into a smaller house – the austerely beautiful Glyndebourne Traviata would surely bring out the best in her. But this Violetta is lost both visually and vocally, thrown into the shallow end of a ghastly Act One party – Paris or Hollywood, who can tell? – set way back on the vast Coliseum stage, so that even at the front of this limited acting space Boyle can't be properly heard. In any case both she and the even more unfortunately served South African tenor Lukhanyo Moyake are crucified by wildly inappropriate gestures in a relationship we never begin to fathom; this Alfredo, delighted to have touched the tender heart of the flamboyant good-time girl, executes an embarrassing little dance before waving ineptly and repeatedly as he waits for the lift at the back of the stage.It doesn't get any better once the young man and his reformed girl head off for their country idyll in Act Two. Discovered on a swinging bed in the middle of a circular astroturf garden flanked by curtains which make it look as if the money ran out – designer Lizzie Clachan is better than this – the lovers have to do various stagy things with flowers as unmotivated props; Violetta becomes first Ophelia, distractedly making a floral display when confronted with Germont père – Alan Opie, dramatically limited to helpless arm waving, still in reasonable voice after 50 years with ENO but no longer able to float a seductive baritone legato – and then Lucia with a knife (the start of the duet pictured above). Her deathbed is a grave she's seen digging in a cemetery of mattresses, unconnected to anything that's gone before.At this point Boyle and her conductor, Leo McFall, show they would have poignancy to offer under different circumstances. McFall and the ENO Orchestra give us the unalloyed pleasure of the evening in an exquisitely phrased Act 1 Prelude with the curtain mercifully down, but then fail to propel the party action (not easy when your company is so far back). The many pauses in Violetta's recitative and aria are not intense but leaden; presumably that's at Kramer's bidding and isn't McFall's fault (there was a similar problem Robin Ticciati couldn't entirely overcome in Claus Guth's Glyndebourne production of Mozart's La clemenza di Tito). They seem to go hand in glove with some desperately flat singing from Boyle, lessening as the evening goes on – and she certainly has the high-lying fireworks for the role, as well as the looks and the pathos nipped in the bud by the director. Moyake should perhaps have ditched some of the moves Kramer asks of him when it came to the first night; the apogee of silliness is the bum-wiggling on all fours in an attempted childlike playfulness during the duet of reconciliation. He shouldn't attempt the top note Verdi never asked of him in the Act 2 cabaletta; but he does have some conventional Italian-tenor ardour, and ignites with anger at a second party filled with clichéd bondage rubbish. At least the ensemble-finale lets the singers just do their stuff, and the music begins to take off (pictured above). The chorus, orchestra and McFall do their best to atone in the whores/clients divertissement with bags of energy, but Teresa Rotemberg's so-called choreography is a non-starter. Of the smaller roles, only the Annina of Martha Jones emerges with dignity intact.What saddens me most is that first-time operagoers, who would have been deeply impressed with the visual beauty and dramatic precision of Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream in the classic Robert Carsen production and hopefully laughed themselves silly at Cal McCrystal's rigorously focused Iolanthe, must wonder what the hell the fuss is about. Traviata is, besides, one of the biggest casualties of opera in English – Martin Fitzpatrick's translation sounds leaden, but that may be the fault of feeble stage motivation – and with Kramer doing little to bring the singers downstage enough of the time, audibility is a problem. Even the chilly Peter Konwitschny predecessor, cutting 20 minutes of music and running straight through without the two intervals given here, woud be preferable If ENO wants Traviata as a moneyspinner in its rep. This Traviata as travesty isn't good enough and makes fools of its singers. The second star is for them, the conductor and the orchestra.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-traviata-english-national-opera-review-vortex-ineptitude,2
47,"Wake, Birmingham Opera Company review - power to the people",Wake,Birmingham Opera Company,2018-03-15,Richard Bratby,"“Would you like a veil?” asked a steward, offering a length of black gauze, and when you’re at a production by Birmingham Opera Company it’s usually wisest to say yes. You get used to it - the frantic Google-mapping to locate the venue; the hike through the broken concrete and mud of Birmingham’s post-industrial fringe to whatever derelict factory the company has occupied this time around; the racing certainty that at some point you’re going to be hustled through a passageway by a bomber jacket-clad Graham Vick. (At La Scala and Covent Garden, audiences watch what Vick has directed. Only in Birmingham are they actually directed by him). “Put on your veils and try to imagine you’re asleep” commanded an MC. It’s all part of the BOC ritual: a deliberately unsettling process that breaks down preconceptions about what you’re about to witness, and how you should react.So the world premiere of Giorgio Battistelli’s Wake opened on a vast gloomy warehouse dotted with trailers on which cast members, lit in brilliant white, mimed out activities ranging from swimming to childbirth. An amplified cellist played a low tremolando on a platform; percussionists placed around the room on further platforms responded with shimmers and chimes. Saurian cries occasionally emanated from a brass heavy orchestra, half hidden to one side, while Vick’s chorus – embedded in the promenading audience - responded with sighs and moans. Compelling, unsettling, immersive: we’ve come to expect this from Birmingham Opera Company, and Battistelli has created a music drama tailored to those strengths. The company calls him “Italy’s greatest living composer” - well, that’s Salvatore Sciarrino told. But the commitment of everyone involved was beyond question, particularly the 140 (at least) strong community chorus and acting company, whose absorption in their roles and mastery of Battistelli’s complex, richly layered score gave the whole piece its character: by turns menacing, consoling and viscerally thrilling.The story is based on the New Testament tale of Lazarus, and after a lengthy first scene which only hinted at Battistelli’s lyrical gifts (a cor anglais player and two accordionists processed mournfully through the throng), the music lit up as Giuseppe di Iorio’s stark lighting swung onto Lazarus’s sisters Martha (Nardus Williams) and Mary (Mimi Doulton), and Jesus (Elliott Carlton Hines, pictured below) - a painfully human Messiah, intimidated equally by his own powers and the fickleness of the crowd. The same qualities that make a BOC production so memorable can also be problematic. I got close enough to see the panic flickering across Hines’s eyes, and to hear the moment at which Williams’s guttural wails of grief filled out and flowered into operatic melisma. But depending on where you’re standing in the warehouse, you’re unlikely to be able to decipher more than 50% of the words, and as the audience and chorus were ushered into a corner of the warehouse, with the orchestra making apocalyptic noises in the distance, the climactic act of resurrection will have been visible only to the handful who were able to push their way to the front.No-one, however can have missed the raw, radiant blast of tone that Hines unleashed as he woke Lazarus (Joshua Stewart) who, after reacting with very plausible shock to his reanimation, found an eloquent lyricism that nicely complemented the ringing vocal warmth of both Williams and Doulton (pictured below). Battistelli let fly here too. Splashes of Berg and Messiaen were studded with glinting shards of Reich-like motor rhythms on two pianos, and the orchestra under Jonathon Heyward (who presumably had enough on his hands simply holding his scattered forces together) really soared. It proved to be the score’s musical peak. Jesus was dragged away into an outraged crowd, and the music was lost (as it tends to be when the spoken word enters) behind a sequence of spoken tableaux. A series of cartoonish, generic acts of intolerance, orchestrated by brutish policemen, culminated in Jesus being winched onto what looked like an Oak Furniture Land crucifix. The League of Gentlemen’s Legz Akimbo meets Rik Mayall’s People’s Poet: the pigs are, like, fascists, yeah?Presumably the librettist Sarah Woods intended this to be taken seriously: certainly, like everything else in Wake, it was delivered with fierce sincerity and breathtaking technical co-ordination. Battistelli’s score ends on a dying fall, a barcarolle and a vision of Martha, Mary and Lazarus carried above the swirl of the crowd in a little white boat. It’s a fascinating, often beautiful creation. If, perhaps inevitably, there’s very little character development, the choral writing evokes the crowd’s shifting moods just as powerfully as Vick’s restless direction embodies it in movement. That's fitting: the experience of being swept up within a moving, urgent mass of choral sound is something unique to BOC, and it’s at full strength here. It’s hard to imagine Wake being revived in more conventional venues – a shame, in one way, because there are ideas and sonorities to savour, and it’d be interesting to hear more than occasional fragments of Woods’s libretto. But as a commission for this company and these conditions, it’s almost a triumph. And in the best traditions of Birmingham Opera Company, it’s a musical-dramatic experience that leaves you with ears buzzing, mind racing, and ready to reassess everything you thought you knew about opera.@RichardBratby",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/wake-birmingham-opera-company-review-power-people,4
48,"Rinaldo, The English Concert, Barbican review - Bicket's band steals the spotlight",Rinaldo,The English Concert,2018-03-14,alexandra Coghlan,"It was the work with which Handel conquered London, the Italian opera that finally wooed a suspicious English audience to the charms of Dr Johnson’s “exotic and irrational entertainment”. Three hundred years later, neither Rinaldo nor London’s audience has changed much. The opera is still a musical patchwork of greatest hits loosely stitched together with an outrageous Crusading plot, while the opera-going crowd still doesn’t mind at all, so long as it comes with a good bit of spectacle and some baroque razzle-dazzle – both of which were abundantly supplied at the Barbican by Harry Bicket and his superb players.In the absence of the mermaids, fire-breathing dragons and live flock of sparrows that caused a stir in 1711, the thrills were strictly musical in this concert performance, but Bicket and his team are wizards of another hue, and their enchantments would have given any Armida a run for her money, with or without a Saracen army in tow.First there were the trumpets – four of them – battering us with a fusillade of power and agility, setting the scene for Luca Pisaroni’s gloriously villainous entrance-aria “Sibilar gli angui d’Aletto”. Then it was the strings, announcing “Furie terribili” in a hot cloud of semiquaver sparks, before Tabea Debus coaxed liquid-throated loveliness from her recorder in the trilling, warbling obbligato for Almirena’s “Augelletti che cantate”, and cellist Joseph Crouch offered his delicate, rhetorical commentary to Goffredo’s “Sorge nel petto"". But that was all a mere preamble to Tom Foster’s harpsichord interludes in “Vo’ far guerra” – episodes Handel himself originally improvised, and which here bent the sonic drama into an entirely new shape, gleefully, wittily, impossibly surreal in their harmonic game of free-association. Who needs a flock of sparrows when you have the swarming agility of Foster’s counterpoint – an aural murmuration of staggering skill?We’ve come to expect outstanding casts from these performances, but this one was notable not just for its established stars, but for a number of new names and less familiar faces. We don’t see nearly enough of mezzo Sasha Cooke in the UK, and while the role of patriarch Goffredo sits unhelpfully low in her register, the da capos did give us some tantalising glimpses of this syrup-rich voice. Recently signed by Warner, the 27-year-old Polish countertenor Jakub Jozef Orlinski (pictured above) is an exciting find, making an event out of Eustazio’s nothing of an aria “Siam prossimi”, and projecting his bright, light voice with ease in the Barbican’s awkward acoustic. Young British countertenor Owen Willetts also made a late impression as the Christian Magus. Coloratura soprano Jane Archibald was all vocal thunderbolts and lightning flashes as Armida, holding her own against the polished theatrical creation that is Pisaroni’s slippery Argante – almost, but never quite, succumbing to pantomime. But Joelle Harvey’s Almirena refused to let the bad girl have all the fun, disarming any opposition with the restraint and simplicity of her “Lascia ch’io pianga”. If Iestyn Davies’s full-bodied “Cara sposa” felt like a missed opportunity for introspection and inwardness for the opera’s cardboard cut-out of a hero, his “Abbruggio, avampo, e fremo” and “Or la tromba” showed him at his best – spurring on the English Concert’s trumpets with his gilded breadth of tone and light-footed ease.If there were moments during the performance where Bicket’s ensemble swayed under pressure, some uncharacteristic smudges and tensions in the texture, these felt like a price worth paying for an evening of music-making that sustained something of the manic, improvisatory energy of Foster’s solos throughout – music-making that was anything but safe, rich in both risks and rewards.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/rinaldo-english-concert-barbican-review-bickets-band-steals-spotlight,4
49,"From the House of the Dead, Royal Opera review - Janáček's prison oddity prompts hot tears",From the House of the Dead,Royal Opera,2018-03-08,David Nice,"A political prisoner is brutally initiated into the life of a state penitentiary, and leaves it little over 90 minutes later. Four inmates reveal their brutal past histories with elliptical strangeness - each would need an episode of something like Orange is the New Black - and two plays staged during a holiday for the convicts take up about a quarter of the action. I won't say that director Krzysztof Warlikowski makes complete sense of Janáček's maverick take on Dostoyevsky's semi-fictionalised prison memoir - occasionally he even rather overloads it - but everything on stage has a feverish intensity equal to the extraordinary sounds we hear from the pit.Which in the hands of Mark Wigglesworth, already a superlative Janáček conductor on the evidence of his ENO Jenůfa, and the Royal Opera players sometimes defy belief in what is, astonishingly and shamefully, the House's first run of this unique masterpiece (English and Welsh National Operas, Opera North and Scottish Opera have all done the feverishness proud). Muted horns buzz furiously against shrill high frequencies, instruments are forced to the extremes of their registers; and yet there are such sudden, surging moments of terrible beauty, though rarely any respite. The musical white-heat even overwhelms Warlikowski's interesting but not entirely successful attempt to counterpoint the Prelude with Michel Foucault's thought-provoking words on the prison system; the intellectual idea and sheer naked feeling provoked by the score don't mesh here, especially as Janáček moves to a liberating anticipation of the great freedom not so much as hinted at on the screen. Around this, though, the set-up and follow-through are impeccable on their own terms. A young black basketball player (Salim Sai) stands for the wounded prison eagle (as ""The Eagle"") which finds its wings at the end of the opera; the frantic mime-dance of his friend (Jordan Ajadi, pictured above right) actually suits a score which, though composed in the late 1920s, seems to want to break out into hip-hop and, in the Act 2 ""shows"" Beyoncé. A cast of singers, sounding wonderful from chorus through small roles to the big guns, meshes perfectly with the actors; no stagy gestures or superfluous over-acting here.Usually familiar faces like Peter Hoare, John Graham-Hall, Nicky Spence and Graham Clark - as the Old Prisoner who gets perhaps the most touching line ('he had a mother too"") - are transformed beyond recognition. The first monologue, effortlessly introduced, belongs to Štefan Margita's Luka Kuzmič - crystal clear of meaning, strong of voice, balanced at the other end of the opera by the connected narrative of Johan Reuter's equally compelling Šiškov about the abused but deeply loving Akulka, one of the many invisible tragic heroines of the drama (Margita and Reuter pictured below). Here, at last, there are pauses for reflection in the haunting wordless chorus and the warmer colours the composer brings to a tragic love-triangle. Akulka, in fact, is not quite invisible in this production; Allison Cook's Prostitute, the only woman in an otherwise all-male cast, uneasily takes on her role, just as an earlier village girl is portrayed by the feminine Tatar lad Aljeja - originally intended as a boy sung by a soprano but here, as in a baffling Prague production which actually deserved the boos inexplicably unleashed at the end of last night's performance, sung by a tenor, Pascal Charbonneau.While a tender bond with homoerotic overtones is established between Alleja and Gorjančikov the political prisoner (Willard White, still in strong voice), women are traduced throughout, even if Janáček pours all his love into Akulka's music. The blow-up dolls of the Don Juan scene can be battered in grim fun, just as the murders of men who get in the way bring forth only red confetti. Warlikowski cleverly blurs the lines between acting and being before the two musical plays in the narrative of Skuratov (a striking Royal House debut from Czech tenor Ladislav Elgr, pictured below with Charbonneau).Sound confusing? It could be, and sometimes we wonder where we are, but the wilful blurring of lines at high velocity is Janáček's, not Warlikowski's, and the recurrent themes the director manages to impose are always disciplined. Just as there are sparks of God in most of these beings - Warlikowski, who interestingly tells us he avoided re-reading Dostoyevsky in the cause of finding universality in the composer's lopsided shapes, prefers Genet's ""gold in the mud"" - so colour and movement fill Małgorzata Szczęśniak's malleable designs, the big sets equally pliantly lit by Felice Ross. Like so much else in the short but relentlessly hard hitting evening, they elude easy description. Just go, and one thing's for sure: you should emerge feeling quite different from when you went in. Kafka's axiom that a work of art should be the ""axe to the frozen ice within us"" applies here not only to Janáček and Dostoyevsky, but also to Warlikowski and Wigglesworth. Despite those unfathomable boos, Warlikowski in his UK operatic debut lives up to the extraordinary standards of his Phaedra(s) with Isabelle Huppert. Like that dream/nightmare vision, this is not an experience that can be easily replicated.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/house-dead-royal-opera-review-jan%C3%A1%C4%8Deks-prison-oddity-prompts-hot-tears,4
50,"A Midsummer Night's Dream, ENO review - shiveringly beautiful Britten",A Midsummer Night's Dream,ENO,2018-03-02,David Benedict,"“What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?” Hang on a minute, Tytania, there are no flowers. Instead, as Britten’s ominously low strings slither and tremble up and down the scale, the curtain rises on a huge, near-acidic emerald green hilly slope lying against a seemingly fathomless International Klein Blue cyclorama broken only by a glowing crescent moon. Except it’s not just a hill: it’s also a giant bed; the perfect bed, in fact, in which to spend one wonderful midsummer’s night. This physical metaphor is both central to and typical of director Robert Carsen and designer Michael Levine’s ravishing production. It’s a vivid imaginative leap away from the dutifully literal that nevertheless makes complete sense of the text, music and drama.First seen in Aix-en-Provence as long ago as 1991 and then at English National Opera in 1995 followed by revivals, the production was mothballed in favour of Christopher Alden’s initially fascinating but flawed production which turned the piece into a psychodrama set in a boys’ school drawing darkly on Britten’s fascination with boys. Despite some captivating ideas, it spoke to only part of the score and made you consistently aware of the director and his thoughts about Britten. This production, beautifully and precisely revived by Emmanuelle Bastet, unobtrusively reminds you what a great and lovely work it is. It’s not just the big picture which is so entrancing, it’s the compelling detail in the way characters are presented and played. There’s a delicious formality to the proceedings. The 20 fairies operate like a phalanx of tiny, po-faced, green-frock-coated butlers following orders. They even sniffily put extra gloves on over their own gloves when instructed to scratch Bottom’s head. Against this rigour, character detail is allowed to take wing. And in a nice case of ENO doing what it should be doing, most of the cast is drawn from the next generation of singers, all of whom not only acquit themselves extremely well but who work impressively as a team. That much is clear from the lovers’ fight scene (pictured above, Matthew Durkan's Demetrius, Clare Presland's Hermia, David Webb's Lysancer and Eleanor Dennis's Helena) – ending in this case, of course, as a pillow fight. The action is precise and thus properly fierce and funny, the slapstick and slapping courtesy of the then young movement director, Matthew Bourne. Whatever happened to him…There’s real wit here and not just Miltos Yerolemou’s bouncy Puck (pictured below with Christopher Ainslie's Oberon) who leaps about and off the set with near-vicious glee. The mechanicals are sharply individualised and never overdone. Robert Murray’s Flute/Thisbe wonderfully delineates his character’s growing self-confidence. Armed with a physically relaxed presence and a rich, beautifully produced bass, Joshua Bloom pulls off the considerable trick of tastefully playing a character who has no taste. It’s easy to go for broke as Bottom but Bloom stays truthful while maximising laughs. There’s a lovely gleam to the sound of Soraya Mafi’s spirited Tytania who is nicely balanced by Christopher Ainslie’s Oberon. The latter is a tough role to sing: the writing sits unusually low in the countertenor range which makes it hard to project in this huge theatre. It’s to Ainslie’s credit that he doesn’t sacrifice tone in order to over-project. In the first, expository act, conductor Alexander Soddy might help him a shade more by lessening the weight of the orchestral accompaniment but elsewhere he allows Ainslie to shine, not least in the shiveringly beautiful finale, “Now until the break of day.”Whenever Britten’s finest works are discussed, Peter Grimes is always the leader, closely followed by The Turn of the Screw – and with good reason. A Midsummer Night’s Dream rarely makes it to the top of the list, probably because it’s based on too well-known a source and because it’s actually funny, especially all the opera pastiche in the Pyramus and Thisbe play (pictured below). Yet Britten and Pears’ filleting of Shakespeare is superbly deft and a production of this quality makes you appreciate two things. Firstly, this is a seriously good opera. Secondly, watching Carsen and Levine mine every phrase of the text and every moment of Britten’s expressively idiosyncratic orchestral writing – listen out for the two harps, the harpsichord and the battery of percussion: hell, there’s a xylophone, a glockenspiel and even a vibraphone – you realise how poorly generalised many productions are.In a word, magical.@eggsbened",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/midsummer-nights-dream-eno-review-shiveringly-beautiful-britten,5
51,"Dialogues des Carmélites, Guildhall School review - calm and humane drama of faith",Dialogues des Carmélites,Guildhall School,2018-02-27,Sebastian Scotney,"One question dominates any staging of Dialogues des Carmélites. How will the production team deal with the cruelty and tragedy in the 12th and last scene when all of the nuns, one by one, go through with their vow of martyrdom and calmly proceed to the guillotine, singing the Salve Regina? No spoilers here, but this new production at Guildhall School (a very different one from that staged in 2011) sticks to a tone which is calm, and humane. For that considered sense of unity, this is a production well worth seeing.Scenographer takis, director Martin Lloyd-Evans, and lighting designer Robbie Butler have made a production which concentrates the audience’s attention on the characters and on the text. The scenery is minimal and symbolic, it never gets in the way, and there is much clever and allusive use of hanging stage flats. (These do have the habit of occasionally swinging gently like Foucault’s pendulum, but that – I guess – is their fate.)Poulenc explained one of his priorities in the composition in the very early stages of the composition of Dialogues des Carmélites. In a letter to Pierre Bernac as he was getting going very rapidly with the project in 1953: he referred to “a very clear orchestration to let the text pass through”. So the tough challenge for non-native speaker singers at the beginning of their singing careers is to bring out the clarity and intent in the libretto which Poulenc extracted from a play by Georges Bernanos (1888-1948). Recordings and recent productions – like the Brussels one with Véronique Gens in the role of the second Prioress Madame Lidoine – set the bar high. In this Guildhall production the singers in the first of two casts who did best were Claire Lees as Soeur Constance (delightful, even fitting in a bit of Whoopi Goldberg Sister Act dancing), Chloe Latchmore as Mère Marie and the tenors Eduard Mas Bacardit as the Chevalier and Daniel Mullaney as the Aumônier (they will reverse roles in the second cast). Blanche (Lucy Anderson), the old Prioress (Georgia Bishop, pictured above) and the second Prioress (Michelle Alexander) all gave affecting and vocally secure performances, but I wanted more of Bernanos’ textual subtlety to shine through.Conductor Dominic Wheeler’s sense of pace and balance throughout and the orchestral standard was very high indeed. The strings led by Enyuan Khong played with clarity. Flutes, clarinets and bassoons all had a great night. The writing for the horns is merciless and there were very occasional, forgivable mishaps. Tuba player Anna Carter underpinned a wonderful moment in Act II with delicacy and poise. Carmélites is a tricky work but its uniquely subtle strengths shone through last night.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/dialogues-des-carm%C3%A9lites-guildhall-school-review-calm-and-humane-drama-faith,4
52,"La Vie Parisienne, Royal Birmingham Conservatoire review - vintage champagne in a new bottle",La Vie Parisienne,Royal Birmingham Conservatoire,2018-02-23,Richard Bratby,"Don’t you just love that new concert hall smell? The main hall at the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire is so new that as soon as you walk in you get the scent of fresh woodwork; so new, in fact, that it won’t even be officially opened until next month (Mirga Gražinytė-Tyla and the Earl of Wessex are doing the honours, apparently). And it’s a beauty: a spacious, shoebox-shaped room with a stage big enough for a Mahler symphony and acoustics that are lucid (without being flashy) in all registers. You can sort of understand why the RBC succumbed to the temptation to smash a bottle of musical champagne over their new home with this semi-staging of Offenbach’s La Vie Parisienne.It’s not the usual procedure. The RBC’s vocal department usually hires the pocket-sized Crescent Theatre in Brindleyplace which – although it struggles to accommodate a full orchestra – at least has the basic equipment of a theatre. With the orchestra at the back of the platform and drapes forming an ad hoc proscenium, there was a sense throughout this energetic and frequently very funny production that it was straining at the limits of what was possible with this minimal set-up – full costumes, but no scenery beyond a couple of tables and a sofa.That’s not meant as a criticism of Michael Barry’s production. If anything, it’s a reflection of the energy and inventiveness with which he marshalled his chorus scenes and choreographed each number – no song without a dance here – and the sheer brio with which his student cast went at it. You don’t expect superpowered singing from a student production, but the spoken dialogue (every bit as crucial in operetta) can trip up even professional companies. Barry uses a droll English translation by Clive Timms and Martin Lloyd-Evans, and for every groan-inducing pun (“If she was a Swede, that’d be a turnip for the books”) there was a little touch of wit that gave the performers something to run with. One of the joys of the show was how fully they inhabited their personas, whether James Gribble’s strutting bantam of a Bobinet, Hélène Ducos’s feline Métella, or Joe Clayton’s drooping dignity as the head waiter. I’ve still no idea why Barry transformed the shoemaker Frick into a lederhosen-wearing comedy German, but Dominic Lee (pictured above, with Jack Dolan as Gardefeu) carried it off with lugubrious good humour.It looked colourful, too. There wasn’t much visual scope to evoke the City of Light, so Jennet Marshall’s costume designs sketched the general atmosphere, updating Offenbach’s Second Empire to a comparably louche 1920s complete with flapper dresses, pencil moustaches and pinafore clad schoolgirls (plus attendant nuns) straight out of Ludwig Bemelmans’s Madeline. But of course it’s the music that really supplies the fizz, and La Vie Parisienne is premiere cuvée Offenbach, bubbling pure from the source (there’s a reason why they called him the Mozart of the Champs-Elysées). To his credit the conductor, Michael Seal, knew better than to handle it like Sèvres porcelain, and while the big choruses bustled along exuberantly, and the violins had a seductive way of caressing a melodic line, he was ready to deliver a brisk rhythmic kick when necessary – while piccolo and bassoon got their due share of the comic action. The singers seemed empowered by such close support: predominantly undergraduates (or so I understand), it’s perhaps unsurprising that many of the voices were somewhat underweight. (English translation or no, the absence of surtitles in the sung numbers was a serious problem). But that doesn’t necessarily stand in the way of a persuasive performance, and Jack Dolan’s big, brisk and engagingly raffish Gardefeu had a lively comic rapport with both Gribble and Andrew Randall’s delightfully dry stick of a Swedish baron. Occasionally a voice seemed under-utilised – I’d like to have heard more of Andrew Armstrong’s handsome baritone as the manservant Prosper (pictured above left), and Elouise Waterhouse made the haughty best of the underwritten role of the Baroness. Ducos found a properly steely diva snarl as Métella showed her claws; and she had a rather stylish way of draping melody over an accompaniment. But it was Elise Fairley as the glovemaker-on-the make Gabrielle who ran away with the show – as Gabrielle so often does. This was a voice with a genuine soubrette sparkle, carried with smiling assurance: social-climbing has never looked so much fun. And if it’s to be hoped that the RBC’s operas are back in a proper theatre next time around, it doesn’t detract from the fact that – as a one off celebration – this Vie Parisienne is nothing if not a lot of fun.@RichardBratby",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-vie-parisienne-royal-birmingham-conservatoire-review-vintage-champagne-new-bottle,3
53,"Dead Man Walking, Barbican review - timely and devastating meditation on human violence and forgiveness",Dead Man Walking,Barbican,2018-02-21,alexandra Coghlan,"You have to wonder why it has taken this long. Jake Heggie’s Dead Man Walking premiered in San Francisco back in 2000 and has since been performed over 300 times across the world, staged everywhere from Cape Town to Copenhagen. Only now, 18 years on, has this contemporary classic finally received its UK premiere at the Barbican in a one-night-only, semi-staged, concert-hall version of Leonard Foglia’s production originally created for Chicago, and most recently seen in full force in Madrid. Eighteen years.In the time it has taken Dead Man Walking to almost reach us in London, we’ve had two elaborate, fully staged productions of Nico Muhly oratorios masquerading as operas (and at least one by John Adams), several indifferent, profoundly undramatic late operas by Philip Glass, and more minor works mistaking motoric ostinati for dramatic scaffolding than I can count.So, when presented with a tried-and-tested piece of music-drama with a real-life story made famous by a Hollywood blockbuster, it begs the question of whether snobbery or cynicism has prevented UK opera companies from committing to a run, even without the box-office guarantee that this performance offered in the form of Joyce DiDonato’s Sister Helen  Prejean.The Louisiana setting of Heggie’s opera – the first, of a fast-growing catalogue by the American composer – gives him the key to unlock this forbidding story of an unrepentant double murderer on death row, his friendship with nun Sister Helen (DiDonato, pictured right with Michael Mayes as convict Joseph de Rocher), and his eventual execution by lethal injection. The spiritual “He will gather us around” becomes the musical thread woven right through a work that sits, without apology or compromise, at the junction of opera and music-theatre. It sets the tone for music whose essentially classical, tonal harmonies warp and bend in a bluesy heat-haze, slipping easily from Barber to Bernstein (in Broadway mode) and still further without ever feeling like pastiche.And that’s the excitement here; what Heggie and librettist Terrence McNally have so brilliantly achieved in Dead Man Walking is to create an unaffected, genuinely contemporary, genuinely dramatic operatic telling of a story that has the scope to take it. Characters speak – actually speak – to one another in language whose vernacular (“Have some respect, she’s a fucking nun”) is the rough, sometimes funny, always familiar communication of everyday, not the odd, affected opera-speak that we regular suspend disbelief over. It’s a language that gives Heggie in turn the space both to swell into great, climactic choruses in the finales of both acts, but also the flexibility and agility to zoom in close for a passing conversation between Sister Helen and a traffic cop.Performances honed in Madrid translated beautifully to the simpler staging here, and the new accompaniment of the BBC Symphony Orchestra under a typically incisive Mark Wigglesworth. DiDonato has lived with and grown with this role since 2002, and it shows. Heggie’s grateful vocal writing and McNally’s just-this-side-of-sentimentalism show off the best of this generous stage-creature, and if there is still an odd fluttering and an occasional wildness to the very top of the voice, it’s still an exhilarating performance. We got no less from Michael Mayes’ Joseph de Rocher (pictured above), whose craggy physicality and cringing bravura has all the sharp nooks and rough dramatic fissures of his namesake. Mayes’ baritone, by contrast, is molasses-smooth, and thickly poured through his Act Two aria.An all-star supporting cast that included Susan Bickley, James Creswell and Susan Bullock, as well as a radiant performance from Canadian soprano Measha Brueggergosman as Sister Rose and fine contributions from both the BBC Singers and Finchley Children’s Music Group, gave their all, delivering one of the most complete and engrossing performances the Barbican has seen so far this season. As a musical performance it was exemplary, but as a meditation on the human capacity both for horror and forgiveness, for love in the face of senseless brutality, it was – in this of all weeks – a very necessary balm.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/dead-man-walking-barbican-review-timely-and-devastating-meditation-human-violence-and,5
54,"Flight, Scottish Opera review - poignant and powerful, this production soars",Flight,Scottish Opera,2018-02-19,Miranda Heggie,"Inspired by the astonishing true story of Mehran Karimi Nasseri, the Iranian refugee who lived in Charles de Gaulle Airport for 18 years, Jonathan Dove’s Flight is a humorous, touching, uplifting yet profoundly poignant study into human relationships, interactions and emotions. This is opera buffa for the modern age – relevant, relatable, lighthearted and often downright silly, but still revealing some very pertinent truths. Stephen Barlow’s slick production, first seen in an outdoor setting at Opera Holland Park in 2015, is transported to Glasgow's Theatre Royal by Scottish Opera, its single set serving as a perfect backdrop for the claustrophobic inertia of an airport terminal.The beginning of Act 1 sees the airport in the very early hours of the morning, capturing the dreamy, ethereal stillness of a world on the brink of awakening. Soprano Jennifer France, as the God-like controller, alone in her tower, sings with a stunning clarity, giving the role a balanced fusion of dominance with serenity, as James Laing’s Refugee stares up at her in awe (the two pictured below). As the airport springs into life, the Scottish Opera Orchestra is on tremendous form, colouring Dove’s vivid, witty score. The chimes of an airport announcement are emulated from tuned percussion and scurrying strings create an air of busyness, of the bustling energy of people in transit.They say you see it all in an airport – the full spectrum of human emotion, people of all creeds and colours, from all walks and stages of life. Our passengers here all have their own stories, their reasons to be in the airport. There are Tina and Bill, a married couple looking to reignite their passion for each other on holiday, a diplomat and his pregnant wife off to start a new life in Minsk, an older lady patiently waiting for her younger lover, and of course, the refugee, who witnesses these arrivals and departures day in, day out. A perhaps unlikely bunch of travelling companions, these passengers are forced to band together, as an electrical storm indefinitely grounds all flights.The set returns to darkness for the beginning of Act 2, and in the bleak, gloomy airport, there’s room for emotions to distill and intensify, as cabin fever forces a spotlight on each character’s thoughts and desires. Even the controller shows she is human too as she steps down from her lofty tower, wandering the stage, downcast, cigarette in hand. Mezzo-soprano Victoria Simmonds, making her Scottish Opera debut as the Minskwoman, gives an achingly beautiful performance in the aria ""I bought this suitcase in New York"", as the character ponders her fears over the changes about to befall her; moving to a new country, motherhood, departing the life she knows.As the storm rages, Richard Howell’s clever lighting design heightens the panic and confusion, and the rambunctious lower brass rumblings from the pit convey the frenzy of the outside elements. The characters on stage too descend into chaos. The women raid the drinks trolley, and there’s definitely a layered meaning to Bill and the air steward’s cries of ""I’m so high"" when they take a trip up to the control tower. It’s during the storm, this strange period of fear and uncertainty, that the passengers begin to warm to the refugee, before viciously turning on him, showing the true colours of society’s fickle attitudes towards those desolate and in need.Dawn breaks after the storm, and Act 3 begins with rousing, majestic peals of brass, as the terminal is bathed in light. Flights resume, and everyone can get on with their plans. Everyone, that is, except the refugee. Laing’s portrayal of the Refugee’s account of his journey is chillingly stirring, as he sings with impeccable vocal control against a backdrop of quivering strings.This is a marvellous production, and the synergy between cast members is uniformly sound. Ensemble pieces are delivered with gorgeous vocal blending (seven of the cast pictured above), and Dove’s comic timing is expertly precise. From the pit, the orchestra, under the baton of Stuart Stratford, is resplendent throughout, illuminating the many layers of Dove’s music with dazzling shine.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/flight-scottish-opera-review-poignant-and-powerful-production-soars,4
55,"Iolanthe, English National Opera review - bright and beautiful G&S for all",Iolanthe,English National Opera,2018-02-14,David Nice,"Very well, so ENO's latest Gilbert and Sullivan spectacular was originally to have been The Gondoliers directed by Richard Jones and conducted by Mark Wigglesworth. But that Venetian fantasia has already been seen at the Coliseum in recent years, and Iolanthe - which I can't remember experiencing live with a full orchestra since the declining years of the D'Oyly Carte - ranges wider. Sullivan’s spoof of supernatural Mendelssohn/Weber, as dewily beautiful as its sources, meets Gilbert at his multiple-rhyming sharpest in the mésalliance (that word is French) between fairy ladies and parliamentary gentlemen, with just a dash of the right pathos. Could relative opera novice Cal McCrystal, having had trouble making dreary Haydn funny, get it right?He does, and in a way that should please absolutely everyone, given a cast that responds unanimously to his baroque invention. If you're not crying with laughter midway through the second act, visit your GP. The worry was that where Mike Leigh had respected his material in The Pirates of Penzance at ENO, the One Man, Two Guvnors prankster would over-egg the confection. As it turns out, though, McCrystal never oversteps the line, even if he approaches it in a spun-out gag with sheep manoeuvres during Dresden shepherd Strephon and shepherdess Phyllis’s pretty love-duet (animals regularly steal the scene here). Generally, though, all the extras simply turn the comic screw further. And the instinct for what’s kept the Savoy Operas evergreen is complemented by a bewitching final set-and-costumes fling from the late, lamented Paul Brown, unquestionably a visual genius of the operatic stage. Tim Mitchell's lighting does it incandescent justice.This awe-inspiring visual tour-de-force comes close to the opulence of Brown’s chrysanths-under-glass Pelléas et Mélisande for Graham Vick at Glyndebourne, but the Victorian toy-theatre Palace of Varieties is in earnest, not in its decadence like the Edwardian castle of Debussy and Maeterlinck's Allemonde. Giant blooms and fantastical flower-fairy costumes (Yvonne Howard's Queen and attendant fairies pictured above) wing out and are replaced by a Claude-esque landscape with even lovelier bosky groves painted on flats for Arcadia, temporarily wrecked by a lavish production coup as the Peers tantantarara in to let off Industrial-Revolution steam and rural slaughter; House of Lords in Act Two is just as much of a visual treat. Expensive, surely, and it would sit well in any West End theatre.As would the dramatic and vocal teamwork, which deserves an extended run. Under the eagle eye of conductor Timothy Henty, for whom the ENO Orchestra on first night was a little less razor-sharp than the singers, at least in the most bewitching of all Sullivan overtures, they deliver the goods with unstinting energy. For the chorus there’s too much to do to ever lose focus. Lizzie Gee’s resourceful dance routines are familiar from her work on Sasha Regan’s all-male HMS Pinafore and The Pirates of Penzance; they somehow trip the fine line between chorus-number show-offiness and the real magic needed for these sometimes heavy-footed fairies – gags built in to the music. McCrystal’s layering gives us multiple variations on the chorene out of step and a raunchy part for the usually overshadowed third fairy Fleta, Flick Ferdinando delivering Toby Davies’s judiciously timed extra material with gusto. Of the two other extras, Clive Mantle’s Captain Shaw doubles as warm-up artist and explanation for the Fairy Queen’s wish that “thy brigade, with cold cascade, quench my great love” for Private Willis (the original head of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade was in the first-night audience). Mantle gets his laughs, but the star in that department is funny face and flexible body Richard Leeming as the Lord Chancellor’s Page. To enrich the tradition whereby a G&S Act Two trio gets its encores, McCrystal turns it into a quartet with Leeming as fall guy (pictured above with Andrew Shore and Ben McAteer).Not that the singers are overshadowed. Marcus Farnsworth’s energetic but focused Strephon and Ellie Laugharne’s feisty Phyllis follow that with a brilliant tap number (pictured below); the rival Earls Tolloller and Mountararat, tenor Ben Johnson and baritone Ben McAteer, sing just as beautifully and act out their more-than-bromance, public-school style, deliciously. Let's just say it doesn't need a plot device to bring out their inner fairies. Barnaby Rea has the right poise, too, on belated sentry duty. Yvonne Howard is a commanding, impressively chest-voiced but unusually attractive Fairy Queen, and though Andrew Shore's Lord Chancellor began last night wrong-footed by the text, his usual comic authority shone in a Nightmare Song all the better for being taken at a steady pace, not just showily pattered, the more to underline the brilliant lyrics and Sullivan’s sly touches in the orchestration. The scene with his long-lost, eponymous fairy wife (Samantha Price) was perhaps not quite as moving as it had been in the all-male Iolanthe at Wilton’s Music Hall. But there’s no disguising the fact that the instrumentation adds layers of beauty and sophistication you can never get with mere piano accompaniment, however inventive a fringe show. Both quaint and timeless, the essential innocence is respected despite the earthy trimmings, and topical references for a Parliament which was, of course, only Tories and Whigs at the time of composition are kept to a minimum (though a flaxen mophead does bumble through on a bicycle and one of his partners in crime is also among the Lords). This is a production that equals in its visual pleasures what you hear. Unmodified rapture, then, and one to see two or three times; take a child of seven upwards and an aged relative, they ought to love it equally.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/iolanthe-english-national-opera-review-bright-and-beautiful-gs-all,5
56,"Un ballo in maschera, Opera North review - decent, no more",Un ballo in maschera,Opera North,2018-02-12,graham Rickson,"You’d expect a degree of mischief and bafflement in an opera about mistaken identity, closing with a scene set at a masked ball. But Tim Albery’s new Opera North Un ballo in maschera is confusing for the wrong reasons, its shortcomings all the more irritating compared how good the performance actually sounds. Verdi was forced by censors to relocate his 18th century Swedish shenanigans to Boston, his real life protagonists recast as nonsensical fakes (King Gustav becoming ""Riccardo, Earl of Warwick""). Albery sensibly returns us to Northern Europe, the sets and costumes suggesting that we’re in the mid-20th century.Designer Hannah Clark’s dour colour scheme is pure Scandi-noir, though the grey suits worn by the chorus in the opening scene make it difficult to discern who’s who and who’s singing what. Rafael Rojas’s King Gustavo could be just another bloke in a nicely cut suit. He's more stressed-out senior manager than commanding head of state, complete with a capable PA in the form of a scene-stealing Tereza Gevorgyan as Oscar (pictured below). Rojas sings beautifully, if a little harshly at times, but he's a tad too sympathetic: we don't understand why he's so despised by those plotting against him.Still, Antonio Somma’s lucid libretto and some of Verdi’s most viscerally entertaining music make the production whizz by, despite the incongruities piling up. Patricia Bardon’s commanding clairvoyant Ulrica is excellent, though why she’s dressed up to resemble Marlene Dietrich, holding court in what looks like the Black Lodge from David Lynch’s Twin Peaks, is left unexplained. Still, seeing the red drapes slowly rise is a visual treat, and it’s fun to watch Rojas disguised as a sea captain. As you’d expect, the forecast is stormy, Ulrica predicting that Gustavo will be killed by the next person to shake his hand. Inevitably, this turns out to be his best friend and advisor Anckarström, sympathetically portrayed by a fresh-voiced Philip Rhodes.The most arresting singing comes from the Hungarian soprano Adrienn Miksch (pictured below with Rhodes) as Anckarström’s wife Amelia: her extended love scene with Gustavo at the start of Act II is riveting, her high pianissimo notes perched on the very edge of audibility. Glorious playing too from the company’s former music director Richard Farnes’s orchestra, the weeping cor anglais solo matching Miksch note for note. Farnes’s dynamic control is his greatest asset: he revels in Verdi’s quirky details and never lets the orchestra overwhelm his voices. The fortissimo chord which erupts when Gustavo and Amelia declare their love is overwhelming. They make a credible couple, his bluff, no-nonsense manner matched by her refinement. Miksch is especially good near the opening of the final act, accepting her husband’s brutal demands with heartbreaking stoicism. The titular masked ball is unseen; instead, we see the guests catching their breath between dances. Having the entire cast bewigged in whiteface makeup is disconcerting, as if we’ve suddenly leapt back 200 years. Trying to spot Gustavo and Anckarström is like playing a live action version of Where’s Wally? And why is Gevorgyan’s Oscar now a young girl in a ball gown? I was baffled. Happily, outstanding chorus work and Farnes’s electrifying conducting save the day: the bleak close packs a mighty punch and we’re left wanting more. Decent, but not quite decent enough, especially given Albery’s excellent track record with this company.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/un-ballo-maschera-opera-north-review-decent-no-more,3
57,"Tosca, Welsh National Opera review - ticking the traditionalist boxes",Tosca,Welsh National Opera,2018-02-10,stephen Walsh,"Opera-lovers: if you’ve finally had enough of the wheelchairs and syringes, the fifties skirts and heels, the mobile phones and the white box sets, and the rest of the symbolic paraphernalia of the right-on modern opera production, pop along to the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff and catch up with Michael Blakemore’s quarter-century old staging of Puccini’s great warhorse. Blakemore’s Tosca (with designer Ashley Martin-Davis) ticks every box on the traditionalist’s questionnaire, from the plausible (if not accurate) Sant’ Andrea della Valle of Act 1 to the only slightly rearranged Castello Sant'Angelo of Act 3, via a spectacularly deluxe dining room in the Farnese Palace in which Scarpia eats, tortures, and is murdered, complete with candles and crucifix, just as in the score, and where all are dressed exactly - not symbolically - as they would have been in Rome on the 14th June 1800.Absurdly literal-minded? Maybe. But Tosca is a work that raises few if any issues. It’s a work of straight, powerful, well-told melodrama that belongs precisely where and when it is set, pace those updated productions that have to pretend that the battle of Marengo happened in 1960 or that Tosca might have been seduced by a police chief in a fawn raincoat. Puccini, musically and theatrically brilliant, intellectually uncomplicated, needs nothing beyond strong staging and high-class singing and playing, both of which it gets in this revival by Benjamin Davis, conducted by Carlo Rizzi.All the same, the pasteboard aspect of verismo opera is impossible to avoid. Italian tenors are always like Italian tenors, unless they are not Italian and then possibly not so stylish. As it happens Hector Sandoval is Mexican, nevertheless a good Cavaradossi, a slightly stiff actor, inclined to face front at awkward moments, but vocally strong enough to rise above Puccini’s sometimes fierce orchestration, and with tender moments, in “O dolci mani” and “Amaro sol per te m’era morire,” where the composer at last allows him some extended lyricism.Scarpia, likewise, is a one-dimensional figure, though the dimension is large: an Iago in authority and of a viciousness not confined to a single grudge. Mark S Doss portrays well both the ruthlessness and the elegance that if anything intensifies the cruelty, and he sings with a certain refined power, imposing himself on proceedings from the moment of his arrival at Sant’ Andrea - not, admittedly, a moment that Puccini is inclined to play down. Scarpia may be an ugly character, but his genre, unlike Iago’s, is civilised. Doss gets absolutely right, in voice and manner, the extremely sinister tone of this combination.Claire Rutter’s Tosca is also thoroughly idiomatic: every inch the opera star playing the opera star, overdressed, over-coiffured, jealous as a suburban housewife and pious as a Tuscan peasant: above all, on top of Puccini’s sometimes exposed (the start of “Vissi d’arte”), sometimes nearly drowned-out writing for soprano. Here and there at the top the voice has a slight tendency to harden; but overall this is a strong, convincing, finely-sung portrait of a singer who perhaps never altogether abandons the stage.It’s by no means a hack revival. The cast is excellent down the list: Donald Maxwell in a gently modified version of last week’s Melitone as the Sacristan, Michael Clifton-Thomas as a suitably cringing Spoletta, Daniel Grice an Angelotti whose voice, if not his appearance, proclaims the former Consul fallen on hard times. Marvellous playing, as ever, from the WNO orchestra under the dependable Rizzi, and a nice, bouncy chorus of children.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/tosca-welsh-national-opera-review-ticking-traditionalist-boxes,4
58,"Carmen, Royal Opera review - clever concept, patchy singing, sexy dancing",Carmen,Royal Opera,2018-02-07,David Nice,"Roll up, dépêchez-vous, for Carmen the - what? Circus? Vaudeville/music-hall/cabaret? Opéra-ballet, post-Rameau? Not, certainly, a show subject to the kind of updated realism which has been applied by just about every production other than the previous two at Covent Garden. Barrie Kosky dares to tread, and high-kick, where no one has gone before, giving us insights into the nature of Bizet's hybrid, with a few jolts in the score, too. But a staging needs to be authentic in every moment, like the composer, and while some of the cavalcade is brilliant in the extreme, what should be moments of truth aren't always so effective.Part of the problem in this first-cast airing of Kosky’s show at the Royal Opera – it was first seen in Frankfurt in 2016 – is a dramatically weak Don José. Francesco Meli’s is a strenuous, unhoneyed tenor voice: good, at least, for the more brutish later stages. As a character, this José is grim and wooden. Worse, Kosky isn’t interested in making him sympathetic. Yes, we know from Merimée’s novella that the Basque outsider has a violent history by the time of his fatal meeting with Carmen in Seville. Should that make him a cold psychopath, though, totally unresponsive to Micaëla, the girl who brings him news of his mother?In any case this Carmen calls most of the shots, manipulating her men as Master of Ceremonies. She’s first seen as a torero in pink (pictured right), and first heard in the seductive amplified voice of Claude de Demo giving a feminist twist to Merimée’s ennumeration of the 30 qualities Spaniards see as necessary for beauty in a women (he only gets to six, and recommends we look up one Brantôme for the rest). Demo’s voice “does” much of Meilhac and Halévy’s dialogue, too, as well as the stage directions, so we’re not short of a context which this production might not otherwise give us.Of Carmen’s appearance to launch the Habanera, let’s just say it’s a homage to Dietrich’s outrageous “Hot Voodoo” sequence in Blonde Venus (also mirrored, topically enough right now, by Uma Thurman’s Poison Ivy in Batman and Robin). For the rest of Act One, she’s androgynous in white shirt and tie, thereafter gorgeous in black dresses. Anna Goryachova is stunningly agile, and once the big mezzo voice settles in pitch, and we forget about the unGallic vowels, she offers us all we need in vocal acting from a Carmen.Michael Rot’s critical edition of a notoriously fluid score would in normal circumstances make the cutting to the chase of Act One even more padded than usual, since it includes some pointless if musically lively couplets for brigadier Moralès. But since this is for so much of its duration a vaudeville with spotlights behind the gold proscenium arch, and footlights at the front of the stage, that can be justified, even if Gyula Nagy overworks the act. The other surprise is how the Habanera we know and love switches to Bizet’s first thoughts on the number. Like every other “hit” in the show, it’s dazzlingly choreographed by Otto Pichler. The six dancers - three men and three women, though the gender-fluidity and the lack of credits in the main programme led me to think it was an all-male dance group - work their butts off. If you loved the dancing noses which were the best thing about Kosky's Royal Opera Shostakovich, you'll adore these routines, and the chorus makes a succession of surprising manoeuvres, mostly on the steep bank of steps which, variously lit by Joachim Klein, are all we need by way of a set from Katrin Lea Tag. Act Two has the best choreographic sequence, from Danse Bohème to Quintet, which includes promising vocal contributions from Jacquelyn Stucker's Frasquita and Aigul Akhmethina's Mercédès, and the only two native French-speakers among the singers as the male smugglers (Jean-Paul Fouchécourt and Pierre Doyen) - though the second cast will be led by Gaëlle Arquez's Carmen. Escamillo’s number is pure camp rather than masculine swagger. It doesn’t help that Kostas Smoriginas isn’t a strong vocal presence; the part really does need the bass-baritone lower register.When Bizet leaves off the glitz, though, the evening falters, even bores. Conductor Jakub Hrůša, in what (extraordinarily, given all his performances at Glyndebourne) is his Royal Opera debut, fine-tunes all the detail and ensures moments of ravishing beauty, especially in the flute-and-clarinet-led second Entr’acte, where the curtain rises on a chorus sleeping on the mountainside the steps have now become, an arresting tableau. But he lingers way too much on the melodies of the Don José-Micaëla duet, further holding up a slow first act, and the Flower Song. Carmen’s solo in the Card Scene works by virtue of Goryachova’s mesmerising control, and Kristina Mkhitarayan, more a spinto than a lyric soprano, has the big guns for Micaëla’s aria (Mkhitarayan pictured above with Goryachova and Merli). Thereafter Act Three, much the best in Calixto Bieito's differently unbalanced production at ENO, is the least successful here; the fight between fugitive soldier and toreador is a damp squib and the conflict, though musically forceful, doesn’t read well. We’re back to brilliance in Act Four; who could not feel jolly at the spectacle of leaping kids and adults watching the toreador ""procession"" (pictured above)? Here Carmen becomes a sort of Isolde, head and heart destined for death, stepping down with a huge black train behind her, immobilised, proud and defiant, for much of the denouement-duet. The final minutes in Rot’s edition, though, are flaccid, and the last gesture doesn’t work, for me, at any rate, even if it's consistent with the concept. Full marks to Kosky for finding symmetries throughout, like his visionary equal Richard Jones – shredded flower-petals mirrored by discarded cards, woman roped by man in Act One reversed in Act Two – but there has to be emotional heat somewhere, and what comes from Goryachova isn't enough in isolation. Maybe the second cast due for five performances of this run will provide that; there’s enough going on to make a return visit to the production essential.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/carmen-royal-opera-review-clever-concept-patchy-singing-sexy-dancing,3
59,"La forza del destino, Welsh National Opera review - rambling drama, fine music",La forza del destino,Welsh National Opera,2018-02-03,stephen Walsh,"David Pountney’s tenure at WNO has been an almost unqualified success, despite some eccentricities of repertoire and a certain obstinacy in the matter of new commissions. His own productions have included at least three of unforgettable quality. He has vigorously promoted money-saving co-productions like this one with Theater Bonn. But there is not much, for my money, that even he can do with La forza del destino, Verdi’s ramshackle response to an early 1860s commission from the Imperial Theatres in St. Petersburg.Did Verdi have in mind some vague idea of what would go down well in barbaric Russia? It’s often been suggested that the work’s Petersburg premiere in November 1862 helped spark off the Russian love affair with wide-screen operas that mixed massive crowd scenes with intimate personal drama. But there was nothing very new about that idea, and in any case it’s hard to see what the Musorgsky of Boris Godunov could have got from a work that so signally fails to integrate its highly contrived revenge drama with a string of colourful but essentially aimless choruses of peasants, friars, soldiers and assorted vagrants, fronted by Preziosilla – surely the most vacuous of stage gypsies – and the deeply unfunny crosspatch friar Melitone. So: Forza is a blind spot of mine. Too bad. Pountney does his best to fit these bits and pieces together. His Spain is, more or less, that of the civil war. He cleverly turns Preziosilla (the leggy, spry-voiced Justina Gringytė, pictured above with the WNO Chorus) into Destiny itself, forever wandering on in flowing black or sequins and a top hat (designer Marie-Jeanne Lecca), bashing the floor in time with Verdi’s stentorian opening, or handing out weapons to the duelling heroes. He turns the Act II villagers into, presumably, fascist workers and kits out the anti-hero Don Carlo, supposedly disguised as a student, in something similar. He manages swift scene changes, with the help of Raymond Bauer’s highly efficient, if blockish and not very elegant or atmospheric abstract rolling-screen sets; and he hints at connections between the idiotic Hispanic revenge, that overrides all other duties of love, gratitude, intelligence and common humanity, and Spanish attitudes to the Church (the friars ridiculed as a chorus of mitred, bloodstained bishops), and to blood in general – the sort that flows down the generations, as well as the sort that flows when you bleed.But if Forza is a trial dramatically (and it certainly rambles on, even in this discreetly trimmed performance of the revised score), it does have many a fine page of middle-period Verdi – not just the famous overture – and some of his most brilliant scoring, notably for brass and woodwind. The clarinet obbligato to Alvaro’s Act III aria is exquisite, and exquisitely played. The range of orchestral colour generally matches the kaleidoscopic dramaturgy, and is a good deal better organised. And if the individual characterisation is generally wooden, the vocal writing is often memorable. One problem for the top castings, though, is the erratic rhythm of their appearances. Mary Elizabeth Williams captures beautifully and with vibrant tone Leonora’s emotional indecisiveness that is the trigger for the whole ludicrous farrago. But once safely ensconced in her mountain hermitage she vanishes from the stage for what seems like the eternity she craves, while her frustrated co-eloper, Gwyn Hughes Jones (the supposed Inca prince Alvaro), retires to the dressing room for the next hour or so. Hughes Jones, no Laurence Olivier on stage, is a fine, stylish Italianate tenor, if inclined to flatten when lying wounded on a hospital bed, as no doubt one would. Luis Cansino(pictured above with Hughes Jones), as the vendetta-crazed Don Carlo, is a lovely dark baritone, if not exactly athletic of physique. Donald Maxwell, seventy this year and still going strong, does what he can with the lamentable Melitone. Miklós Sebestyén provides a good cameo of the Commendatore-like Calatrava, Leonora’s father, shot dead by a one-in-a-million stray bullet and not even allowed to come back as a statue.And as usual there is the marvellous orchestra under Carlo Rizzi, to relish as one struggles with the mindless confusion beyond the proscenium.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-forza-del-destino-welsh-national-opera-review-rambling-drama-fine-music,3
60,"Orlando, La Nuova Musica, SJSS review - Handel painted in primary colours",Orlando,La Nuova Musica,2018-02-02,alexandra Coghlan,"The advertising for La Nuova Musica’s Orlando billed it as “Handel’s most psychologically complex opera”. Whether or not you agree (and there are plenty of heavyweight rivals – Alcina, Giulio Cesare and Agrippina just for starters) there’s also the issue that it’s only half the story. Orlando may be a complicated portrait of mental instability and madness, but it’s also a magical pastoral comedy peopled with lovelorn shepherdesses and wizards, featuring quite the silliest ending of all Handel (although this too, admittedly, is a much-contested category). This performance did little to reconcile the work’s warring instincts, but some fine music-making along the way meant that it didn’t matter – too much.There’s a flamboyance and excess to period band La Nuova Musica’s style that’s all their own. Director David Bates favours broad dynamic contrasts, extrovert musical drama and lashings of ornamentation. Subtle it isn’t, but in a concert setting there’s much to be said for the resulting clarity, even if some of the emotional detail gets lost under all the frills and furbelows.The main problem was a dramatic arc whose two ends simply didn’t join up. To play Act I and most of Act II so broadly for comedy – transforming the heartbreakingly lovely trio “Consolati o bella” into a piece of musical slapstick, and allowing no space for contemplative beauty and stillness, dispatching Medoro’s exquisite “Verdi Allori” with brisk matter-of-factness – made for a juddering gear-shift into Lawrence Zazzo’s virtuoso mad scene with its real emotional heft, transforming the opera’s serious core into a brief interlude between sillinesses.The same conflict extended not only to an awkward translation (whose try-hard vernacular updatings – exclamations of “OMG” and exhortations to “Butch up!” – struggled to co-exist with the usual limpid brooks and weary brows) but also the cast. Rowan Pierce’s pouting, pantomime Dorinda was thoroughly charming (if vocally rather unanchored), but didn’t belong in the same performance as Lucy Crowe’s measured, thoughtful Angelica. Mediating between the two were countertenors Christopher Lowrey (Medoro) and Zazzo’s Orlando, and William Berger's beautifully sung Zoroastro, who did what they could to reconcile the dramatic differences.Musically things were stronger. Act III gave Crowe the opportunity to use the many colours and shades in her lovely lyric soprano, while Lowrey gilded the stuffed-shirt that is Medoro with his agile, fluting purity that set off the flesh-tones of Zazzo’s (pictured right) craggier, more expansive countertenor. Zazzo’s tendency to distort both pitch and pulse for effect added to the sense of caricature in Act I, but all came into focus in Act III, and the control of his “Gia l’ebro” was absolute (though in the absence of a theorbo the lovely instrumental texture, with its two crooning violas, felt unnecessarily cluttered by the harpsichord).By the end of this much-cut performance I’m still not sure we cared terribly much about anyone, nor had we plumbed any particularly striking psychological depths, but we had heard plenty of nice music, including some particularly elegant contributions from La Nuova Musica’s woodwind and horns. With Orlando just the first in a sequence of Handel operas in concert at St John’s over the next few months, it will be interesting to see how this compares. Next up is Laurence Cummings’s Acis & Galatea on 22 March.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/orlando-la-nuova-musica-sjss-review-handel-painted-primary-colours,3
61,"Das Rheingold, LPO, Jurowski, RFH review - orchestral revelations, but cursing Alberich trumps wooden Wotan",Das Rheingold,LPO,2018-01-28,David Nice,"Vladmir Jurowski and the London Philharmonic Orchestra have been to the bottom of the Rhine before, but in 2015 only did a whistlestop tour of the rest of Rheingold's terrain with an extensive array of excerpts. Having worked with the players on Tristan und Isolde and DIe Meistersinger at Glyndebourne, their ever-thorough and brilliant music director decided that the time has come to tackle the most daunting of Wagner's music-dramas, one opera a year up to 2021 when the river will finally burst its banks and the fortress of the gods goes up in flames.Water and fire already play an impressive role in the first of the Ring operas; just how ahead of his time Wagner was with the impressionism in which the Rhinemaidens swim and the modernistic textures out of which Loge flickers emerged supremely well here. New to me were the woodwind gurgling as most seductive Rhinemaiden Flosshilde promises a love duet with the lusting Alberich, quickly kicked aside, and the special articulation of the brass as they reflect the aspirations of the gods and their negative image in the Nibelung's hellish strivings.You really heard as well as saw the four Wagner tubas which ballast their horn cousins, and Paul Benniston's trumpet had all the space it needed. It was good to get the nine players wielding the 18 anvils which sound-image the slave labour of Nibelheim on the platform rather than offstage, and the percussion made a frightening din which meant we didn't miss the usual screams of the Nibelung workers slave-driven by Alberich. The Festival Hall doesn't offer any glow around the sound - I couldn't help longing for the perfect acoustic, that of the concert-hall in Budapest's Müpa complex where an unmissable Wagner Festival takes place every year - but Jurowski (pictured above with the LPO last night) did his best to make amends. Interesting that previously he had explicitly stated he wanted to do his first Wagner Ring with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, but even with plentiful guest players they couldn't have hoped to make as cohesive a sound as this.There wasn't much in terms of even a ""concert staging"" to parallel the aural illustrations, and Malcolm Rippeth's lighting needed to make much more of the phantasmagorical Festival Hall organ pipes  - really, no gold, and no rainbow, where one colour could have been applied to each of the seven lower sets? More worrying was that though potential director Ted Huffmann was listed as ""consultant"", very little work seemed to have been done on those crucial interactions of characters which, well handled, emphasise how Das Rheingold is the first piece of music theatre in the operatic canon to marry meaning with a wondrous orchestral palette. Like a select few others – several of the late Janáčeks, Shostakovich’s The Nose – and unlike its successors in the Ring drama, Rheingold fares less well in concert than most operas unless there's a perfect fusion of music and text. At least all the singers bar one had been persuaded to do without scores or music stands and project the drama to the varying best of their abilities. The exception was he who should have been most commanding, Matthias Goerne as chief god Wotan (pictured above with Michelle DeYoung as Fricka). The sound can be beautiful, though for me always a bit too much wrapped in cotton wool. But the Rheingold Wotan is never noble, a treaty-breaker from the first scene with Fricka who becomes a greedy opportunist, and having Robert Hayward, one of the role’s best living exponents, alongside Goerne as Wotan’s parallel power-grabber Alberich only pointed up the German bass-baritone’s shortcomings in the role.This was Hayward’s first Alberich, and he was inside the character who becomes the first Lord of the Ring from his first, limping appearance. You even felt his pain as he faced the loss of the only thing that has meaning for Alberich - totalitarian power in the form of the ring, Economical but eloquent of gesture, strong and focused of voice with enough stamina left in this taxing role to deliver the full meaning of his second curse, Hayward (pictured below Tarnhelm-torturing Adrian Thompson's Mime) was the total assumption of the evening – and the highest applause levels suggest I’m not alone in thinking so. We needed that largeness of sound in the opening scene; with the singer-actors behind/above the orchestra, the Rhinemaidens (Sofia Fomina, Rowan Hillier and Lucie Špičková) needed voices one size bigger. Paradoxically their offstage laments at the end of the opera, close to the nicely integrated seventh harp at the side, offered much more vocal glamour. Up on the mountain top, Michelle DeYoung’s Fricka was a superb sacred monster, a glamorous figure in sparkling dress who could have eaten her husband for breakfast (though shame about some of the modified vowels).When her sister Freia is less integral a part of the action in concert, you wished that the wonderful Lyubov Petrova had more to do. Likewise Stephen Gadd as Donner, the storm-raising solo reminding us that this British baritone is under-used here, and Allan Clayton as Froh, beginning to sound as if he could head towards Siegmund territory; right now he would be a superb Loge. So would Adrian Thompson, who temporarily stole the show as a very put-upon but nasty-in-the-making Mime. As it was, the trickiest of Rheingold leading roles fell to Jurowski regular Vsevolod Grivnov (pictured above), not as eloquent an actor as Wolfgang Ablinger-Sperrhacke in the last Rheingold we saw in the Festival Hall, Opera North’s, but more than the usual character-tenor tenor and even though the basic tone isn't lovely - which Loge's is? - he was sensitive to all the dynamics. I’d have liked more of that sensitivity from the tenderer giant Fasolt when he sings of his feelings for Freia; Matthew Rose tended to sing at one dynamic level, though meaningfully, and there was good rapport with nasty co-worker Fafner (Brindley Sherratt, splendid). Which leaves only Erda, and at a distance Anna Larsson didn’t quite own the role as she usually does; maybe it’s time for a young contralto to have a chance in the great prophecy.The stage, finally, was left to the orchestra to glitter with the false pomp of the gods entering a castle built on the shakiest of foundations. We may not have got the full benefit of the six harps, but the LPO brass rammed the point home. Alert to every detail, winning magnificent articulation from the first violins especially, Jurowski has the spirit of Rheingold but perhaps not quite yet its elusive and unsettling soul. I’d like to hear it again once he has Die Walküre, Siegfried and Götterdämmerung under his belt, and with Hayward as Wotan. Anticipate 2022 as the year when we get them all; start saving now and be ready to jump in when booking opens. Meanwhile, there's no rest for the LPO's Music Director in his tenth superb year; it's on to a brilliantly-planned Stravinsky festival in less than a week's time.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/das-rheingold-lpo-jurowski-rfh-review-orchestral-revelations-cursing-alberich-trumps-wooden,3
62,"BBCSO, Pons, Barbican review - love hurts in vivid Spanish double bill",BBCSO,Pons,2018-01-20,David Nice,"This was an evening of Iberian highways re-travelled, but with a difference. At the beginning of 2016, the centenary of Spanish master Enrique Granados's untimely death, two young pianists at the National Gallery shared the two piano suites that make up the original Goyescas; finally last night at the Barbican we got the opera partly modelled on their deepest movements. And back in 2008 Josep Pons and the BBC Symphony Orchestra brandished the revised, full-orchestral 1925 ballet score of Manuel de Falla's El amor brujo rather than the intriguing chamber orchestra original, making a virtue out of the necessity of its spare instrumentation, which they also presented yesterday (albeit with more strings than in the 15-strong ensemble of 1915).Tres hurras go to Falla for bringing a cantaora or flamenco singer into the classical world, and not in a diluted, crossover-y kind of way. Last time it was the compelling Ginesa Ortega as the gypsy Candelas, using witchery to win back her lover, but she didn’t get as much to declaim as Maria Toledo in the original version (pictured below with Josep Pons and members of the BBCSO), a lesson in concert-hall deportment and involvement, and not only when she stood to perform. Which she did with those beautiful and compelling hand gestures and melismas which cut deep, even if the nature of the beast – the delivery usually tends to go inwards in cante jondo, ""deep song"" – needed to be miked. Every inch Toledo's equal for Spanish bite in the very selective orchestration were oboist Richard Simpson and trumpeter Gareth Bimson, while a haunting beauty was evoked by Nicholas Korth’s horn solo and the other-worldly cello song of ineffable Susan Monks in the Cuban guajira of the Introduction to the second scene (think a gentle predecessor of Caetano Veloso’s “Cucurrucucú paloma”).If Pons sometimes seemed delberate in his tempos here, he got all the definition he needed, and let rip with the colour in the opening tableau of Goyescas after the interval, complete with a flaming if score-bound chorus in the expert BBC Singers. There was uncredited assistance here from Kenneth Richardson’s minimal but telling concert staging and some bold lighting which plunged the stage into purple and blue, with crescent moon, for the night scenes. Three of the four Latin soloists owned the stage: fine baritone José Antonio López as swaggering toreador Paquiro, Lidia Vinyes-Curtes as his maja (Madrilenian girl), and above all Nancy Fabiola Herrera as the classy but troubled Rosario (pictured below second from left, with Gustavo Peña at her side).  Granados’s odd attempt to turn his piano pieces and other extant material into a series of operatic tableaux is unbalanced, a bit like starting Eugene Onegin at the party scene and ending with the duel, or in this case its aftermath. There’s no chance for the singers to build up their characterisations: Fernando (Gustavo Peña, a ringing tenor with a bit of a problem with support and a disconcerting habit of putting his hand to his ear in several entries, no actor he) is needlessly jealous of his Rosario, and doesn’t need much provocation from Paquiro to challenge him to a duel at a lantern-lit ball. The denouement is inevitable, but teased out with the deepest and most sensuous music of the opera, taken from the two most memorable movements of the two piano suites, “The Maiden and the Nightingale” and “Love and Death”.The composer's response to Goya – the pictures unseen here, maybe right as the images might detract from the sound, though some could have been reproduced in the programme – is watered down by the stock words of a weak libretto. The scoring can be thick, too; the total masterpiece is the biggest of the piano pieces rather than the operatic love-death we get here. But Fabiola Herrera, as sympathetic a presence throughout as Toledo had been in the first half, gave us the full diva works, blazing in the four big cries of “Amor” and reminding us how much the southern musical temperament can bring to music like this. Hers will surely go down as one of the great operatic performances of the year. Salud to the BBC Symphony Orchestra, too, for bringing this musically inspired work to London; CD release would be very welcome.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music-opera/bbcso-pons-barbican-review-love-hurts-vivid-spanish-double-bill,4
63,"The Return of Ulysses, Royal Opera, Roundhouse review - musical drama trumps dodgy stagecraft",The Return of Ulysses,Royal Opera,2018-01-11,David Nice,"The power of music solves every problem, at least when as bewitchingly performed as it was here. With the great mezzo Christine Rice voiceless for at least a night, and rising star Caitlin Hulcup singing for her from the midst of the instruments in the pit right at the centre of the Roundhouse, how could faithful Penelope's final acceptance of her long-lost husband Ulysses (Roderick Williams) achieve transcendence? Yet it was moving to tears, thanks to the exquisite sensitivities of three very special performers and Christian Curnyn's Early Opera Company. Not even a scattergun production's last gimmick, denying the married couple a final haven as Ulysses slides away from his wife on the outer ring-revolve, could destroy that.A peerless ensemble of singers, fortunately, knows how to use the special communication that the Roundhouse encourages – and certainly there was no problem with the two revolves dead-centre, though I’m not sure that the pit needed to circulate, however slowly, clockwise against the main acting-space. The nature of the beast meant that voices needed to be amplified – by Sound Intermedia, far more obtrusively than in their more discreet work on the Royal Opera’s first experiment here with Monteverdi’s Orfeo, a different set-up with the audience in Greek-amphitheatre formation rather than the full circle (set design here by Hyemi Shin, lighting Paule Constable). The result was that vocal timbres could be flattened, losing the bloom at times. Yet every word could be heard, every nuance of a very grown-up text meditating on time, transience, good and evil, superbly set by Monteverdi and well rendered in Christopher Cowell’s typically eloquent translation, caught without the need for the supertitles.After surprisingly good work on Opera North’s The Snow Maiden, director John Fulljames returned to a melee as before. Sure, the Iliad mythology can take costume gestures from all periods, but it needs a core identity and a concentration on the many one-to-ones where the body language between characters is more important than what’s going on around them. Even sympathetic stage performers like the Jette Parker Young Artist Programme’s wonderful young soprano Francesca Chiejina, so good in last summer’s showcase, and Andrew Tortise as her character’s swain Eurymachus didn’t seem quite comfortable with the switches from naturalism to dance; what the players and the voices did so fluidly, the very essence of Monteverdi’s miraculous variety, the staging obstructed. Way too much running around the ring, too little stillness, even for the central couple.The idea to involve a Community Ensemble as refugees washed up on Ithaca with Ulysses started out well, though the gold capes they were wrapped in soon led to confusion. Penelope’s wealthy wastrel suitors, who seemed to emerge from the exiles rather than appear as long-time fixtures, wouldn’t have allowed these people within 100 yards of the palace. Instead of a change of identity, our valiant amateur performers were roped in to the suitors’ shenanigans; confusing. Having Penelope (Christine Rice pictured above with Samuel Boden) and her trusty old maid Eurycleia (the ever poised and lustrous Susan Bickley) distribute bread and later water to the desperate drew focus away from the situations in question.At least the climactic episode in which the rivals try to string Ulysses’ bow, and only he succeeds – aged and disguised by an all-too-helpful Minerva (Catherine Carby, excellent) –  worked as drama. Fulljames didn’t get in the way of Monteverdi’s superb musical drama at this point. In a production which cut judiciously – let’s not be purist when it comes to these over-ballasted early operas – it was a relief to get glutton Irus’s suicidal final monologue. That ever-surprising tenor Stuart Jackson pulled out some of the biggest, most exciting phrasing of the evening.What luxury, though, to have five superb tenors of various ilks, from young Samuel Boden as Telemachus - you knew when you first saw him that Fulljames was going to get him to take his shirt off later, though the Helen of Troy blond wig couldn’t have been predicted – to Mark Milhofer’s strong characterisation of trusty shepherd Eumaeus.As for the baritone hero, Williams proved yet again that his Lieder-singing detail can be married to a performance of the utmost intensity: magical in dreamy reverie, fierce in vengeance, always sympathetic. There can be no doubt that when Rice gets her voice back, they will be the perfect vocal as well as dramatic match. In the meantime, the release of the final duet still spread its balm as Hulcup (pictured above by Robert Catto), often with her back to Williams owing to the revolves, blended perfectly. Hers is a very different mezzo from Rice’s, less voluptuous, more cutting, but she is already the “real” Penelope’s equal in musicality and engagement. Around her Curnyn’s players glittered, danced, scythed and at times improvised their way through a fuller version of the score than we usually hear. Monteverdi has never sounded more persuasive, not even from Gardiner and company.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/return-ulysses-royal-opera-roundhouse-review-musical-drama-trumps-dodgy-stagecraft,4
64,"Salome, Royal Opera review – lurid staging still packs a punch",Salome,Royal Opera  – lurid staging still packs a punch,2018-01-09,Gavin Dixon,"David McVicar may seem too gentle a soul for the lurid drama of Strauss's Salome, but his production, here returning to Covent Garden for a third revival, packs a punch. He gives us plenty of sex and violence – or at least nudity and blood – but finds the real drama in the personal interactions, the increasingly dysfunctional relationships that eventually doom all involved. That drama is well served by this revival cast, making for some engaging stagecraft. The musical standards are more mixed, however, with only one truly world-class performance, and from a character who loses his head far too early in the evening.McVicar sets the action in a concrete basement beneath a banqueting hall (set designer Es Devlin, revival director Bárbara Lluch). Most of the men are in early 20th century military uniform, and most of the women in underwear of a similar vintage – shades then of Pasolini's Salò. A suitably charged atmosphere is evoked with bystanders lining the back of the stage, half-naked and intoxicated women, bored soldiers listlessly pointing their rifles at each of the characters as they sing. Things get off to a shaky musical start, with David Butt Philip struggling to be heard across the orchestra as Narraboth (a small but hugely demanding role) and his soldier companions also underpowered. As Salome, Malin Byström was more convincing, although it took her the first scene to get to grips with the role. The best of her voice is in the bottom range, which makes up a surprisingly large part of the role, where she brings a burnished mezzo richness. Her upper register is secure (bar a few flat notes early on) but sometimes shrill. But her tone is elegant, just a little too small for the part. The entrance of Jokanaan is an impressive piece of stagecraft. He is imprisoned in a dungeon below the stage, accessed by a circular grate that opens on a huge chain. Michael Volle (pictured above) is perfect for the role, with the sheer size of his voice dwarfing the rest of the cast. But his interactions with Byström are effective too, both seemingly in different and irreconcilable worlds right from their first encounter.The explosive force of the orchestral interlude between the first two scenes raises the musical temperature considerably, but also highlights how temperate and unengaging the accompaniment has been up until then. Conductor Henrik Nánási maintains a brisk, unyielding pace throughout, rarely digging into the dramatic potential of the orchestral writing: everything in this opera must sound dangerous, but Nánási plays it safe.Herod and Heroditas are well played, by John Daszak and Michaela Schuster (pictured below). Daszak is suitably creepy and lecherous, while Schuster plays for dark comedy, the nearest thing to light relief here. And both sing well, although Daszak could do with more power in the top register. And, just as with Volle, Byström’s interactions with Daszak are perfectly gauged, another utterly dysfunctional relationship playing out before us in all its gruesome detail. The Dance of the Seven Veils is presented as a kind of psychological dream sequence, with Salome and Herod passing through a series of doors (seven? I lost count) while associative images are projected behind – a bodice unzipping, a light bulb smashing. I didn’t buy it, it was too conceptual and not sensual at all, but there was no doubt that this was the dramatic focal point of the opera.Then comes the head. Byström gave it her all in the finale, basically a one-woman show, and Nánási too finally found some elemental power in the orchestra. It was certainly a passionate and unnerving conclusion, even if Byström’s lack of vocal weight again deprived the music of its full dramatic potential.Modest ticket sales suggest that this revival of the David McVicar production may be its last. Four stagings is a good run though, over the course of a decade. Reviews of earlier runs report mixed quality among the various assembled casts, and that remains the case here. Of the leads, only Volle and Schuster remain from the first run, and both elevated this performance. Byström’s dramatic portrayal also deserves recognition, but the otherwise mixed cast, and the routine conducting, confirm the production’s status as a dwindling light in the company’s repertoire.@saquabote",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/salome-royal-opera-review-%E2%80%93-lurid-staging-still-packs-punch,3
65,"National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain, Elder, Bridgewater Hall, Manchester review – maturity from teenage players",National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain,Elder,2018-01-06,Robert Beale,"Seventy years old and still imbued with youthful flair and enthusiasm – that’s the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain, which pioneered new territory in its first concert of 2018 last night. The flair and enthusiasm also apply to Sir Mark Elder, who conducted the event. He and the NYO, with help from Chris Riddell (former Children’s Laureate, creator of Goth Girl) and director Daisy Evans and her team, gave the first complete opera performance of the organisation’s history with Bartók's Duke Bluebeard’s Castle.It was the second part of their programme, and a concert performance, to be strict, but with a screen backdrop conveying a strangely antiquated English translation - the performance was sung in Hungarian - as well as a lighting rig to create floods of contrasting colours, four actors from the National Youth Theatre declaiming the spoken Prologue (in English) and reacting from the stage side, and geometric patterns of colour-changing LEDs on the floor (The Curious Case of the Dog in the Night Time has a lot to answer for), it did its best to be theatrical.The young orchestral players were themselves enlisted in the cause and, when not playing, were periodically hiding their eyes, staring at soloists or screen, and lifting their instruments aloft (to represent riches), or their hands (to represent flowers). Most effective of all, Judith and Bluebeard were sung by Rinat Shaham and Robert Hayward as dramatically as is achievable in concert dress and on a stage (and, in Shaham's case, with the book in front of her on a stand – understandably so, as she had stepped in at short notice to replace the indisposed Claudia Mahnke).Their performances were what made it an opera, not just a concert. Shaham's voice is warm and multi-coloured, with a lovely quality floating in high register and great reserves of power throughout, and she portrayed the changing reactions of the young and unsuspecting bride’s first visit to the matrimonial castle, as curiosity turns to fascination, apprehension, grim determination and desperate passion. Hayward's Bluebeard was all self-possession at first, giving way to anger, fear, self-loathing and final resignation as his bloody past was revealed through the castle’s seven doors.Sir Mark took command of the orchestral forces to wonderful effect. There’s always a danger that the NYO, with its enormous resources of player personnel, will blast anyone else off stage, but he encouraged their sound to bloom, not force, and rarely did they overwhelm the singers. The wind soloists and ensemble in particular were a joy to hear – the opening of the first scene was pure magic. The broadside in C major as Bluebeard and Judith open the fifth door, with all hands employed and organ at full throttle, was remarkable for its richness: it can only be a near-showstopping wall of sound, but this was not just spectacularly vivid, but increasingly dramatic as the scene unfolded. It was mature ensemble playing that would have been a credit to any orchestral body, not only one of teenagers who have only known each other for just a few days. The first part of the concert was ‘straight’ orchestral pieces – both fairytale-based and both from a similar era to Bartók’s opera – and those, too, were played with remarkable finesse and skill. Liadov’s The Enchanted Lake had one of the most delicate, whispered openings I’ve heard in it – Sir Mark knows how to get the sort of sweet string tone which sounds so well in the Bridgewater Hall – and included glorious solos from the principal horn.Dukas's The Sorcerer’s Apprentice had another magically gentle start and proceeded with light-footedness all the more remarkable for the numbers involved. Elder’s pacing was great fun in the opening bassoonists’ grunts, and he carried them with him through smooth and seamless tempo changes, gradually raising tension through the piece. Articulation from violins and brass was spot-on and lively, and the music ended with what can only be called an orchestral LOL.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music-opera/national-youth-orchestra-great-britain-elder-bridgewater-hall-manchester,4
66,Best of 2017: Opera,Best of 2017: Opera,,2017-12-26,David Nice,"It may not have been the best year for eye-popping productions; even visionary director Richard Jones fell a bit short with a tame-ish Royal Opera Bohème, though his non-operatic The Twilight Zone is something else. Instead there's been time to reflect on what makes a true company. While English National Opera, after the end of Mark Wigglesworth's short but unsurpassable tenure, showed what a shortened season looks like – the London Coliseum no longer ""the home of ENO"", Bat out of Hell taking over from June to August – others continued to blaze a trail forward.Top prize for showing how far opera can take us into trying to offer consolation in the face of the biggest horror as well as reaching out to commemorate has to go to Opera Holland Park. It lost a loved staff member in the Grenfell Tower fire, hearted the power of vibrant song when the cast of Puccini's La rondine reprised the big ensemble from Act 2 with even bigger emotion (you can watch it on the next page) and put together a starry line-up of volunteer players and singers (chorus included) for a fundraising Verdi Requiem, about which General Director Michael Volpe wrote eloquently for us here. Elizabeth Llewellyn also gets one of the year's star awards for her role as the ""Swallow"" Magda.Leeds-based Opera North continues to show how a team works at the highest level, with big works involving the chorus throughout two seasons crowned by its ambition in giving us sheer enchantment with Rimsky-Korsakov's The Snow Maiden, albeit heavily cut. Richard Bratby and Robert Beale shared my enthusiasm for John Fulljames's production, which managed to keep the magic within a clever setting – more than could mostly be said for Dmitri Tcherniakov's more lavish Paris production shortly afterwards, though that boasted a peerless cast led by the bewitching Aida Garifullina. The 2017-18 season in Leeds kicked off with a brilliant series of ""Little Greats"", with instalments much admired by Robert and by Graham Rickson (if only in part). In the anything-goes mix-and-matching, I saw only Janáček's Osud, disappointing after the revelation ENO once made of it, and Bernstein's Trouble in Tahiti, a five-star achievement with a dazzling performance by mezzo Wallis Giunta (pictured above by Alastair Muir), young singer of the year in my books.Further north, the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra kicked off the year in thoughtful, complex style with Martyn Brabbins conducting a semi-staged performance of what may be Birtwistle's operatic masterpiece, The Last Supper, five-starred by David Kettle. The orchestra's London counterpart celebrated John Adams' 70th birthday by inviting him to conduct another rich and troubling work, Doctor Atomic, which consolidated its hold and Gerald Finley's claim to owning the role of troubled nuclear scientist Robert Oppenheimer. Thomas Adès's The Exterminating Angel also continued to prove its worth, after last year's Salzburg premiere, with the same cast at the Royal Opera; the intriguing Buñuel premise also hooked Peter Quantrill. Glyndebourne demonstrated its ability to prepare a new work to the very highest level in a clearly, imaginatively staged and superbly cast world premiere, Brett Dean's Hamlet, chosen by Gavin Dixon as his opera of the year, and though question marks remain for me about the finely-wrought substance, here's proof, alongside the Adams, Adès, Birtwistle and even Ryan Wigglesworth's musically one-dimensional The Winter's Tale at ENO, that UK houses and concert halls can always furnish the finest possible team of singers (among the cast pictured above by Bill Knight for theartsdesk, Sarah Connolly as Gertrude, Rodney Gilfry as Claudius and Allan Clayton as Hamlet)..To the west, Bristol was first off the mark in hosting John Eliot Gardiner's semi-staged Monteverdi trilogy – L'Orfeo, Il ritorno d'Ulisse and L'incoronazione di Poppea all hailed by Stephen Walsh, with Alexandra Coghlan choosing the overall achievement as her operatic best of year. Welsh National Opera goes from strength to strength under David Pountney; Stephen admired several of its revivals as much as its new productions, and singles out Pountney's production of Musorgsky's Khovanshchina for revealing even more to him of the work's genius – and from the author of a very fine book on the composer and his circle, that's fine praise indeed (pictured below by Clive Barda: Miklós Sebestyén as Dosifey, Robert Hayward as Ivan Khovansky and Mark Le Brocq as Prince Golitsyn).I too was won over to the post-Musorgsky (mostly Shostakovich-orchestrated) whole, perhaps for the very first time, in Semyon Bychkov's magisterial yet always musical-dramatic and flowing account with the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the Proms, again strongly cast with magnificent Old Believers in Elena Maximova's Marfa and Ain Anger's Dosifey and a peerless chorus with the Slovak Philharmonic Choir as backbone. Vladimir Jurowski's phenomenal hard work – for Hamlet, he'd even called an eight-hour rehearsal for the covers the day before the performance – showed in one of the most complex yet bewitching of all operatic scores, Enescu's Oedipe, faring even better in concert than it had at the Royal Opera in 2016: hats off, a genuine neglected masterpiece.An epic on an even bigger scale was the best Wagner Ring I've seen since Kupfer's at Bayreuth in 1990 – the underrated Ádám Fischer masterminding a minimally staged production, integrated with very original video work, within the world's best concert-hall acoustics, those of Budapest's Müpa concert hall. Iréne Theorin managed a triple whammy of Brünnhildes on three consecutive nights: a living legend. That's the last outing for this 11-year triumph, but more Wagner is on the bill next summer. On a lighter ensemble note, ENO's hit of the year was another revival, of Handel's Partenope, which I was seeing for the first time and which included a hugely impressive last-minute stand-in, young company tenor Rupert Charlesworth. Though Handel can have his longueurs with a less than perfect cast, he sparkled here and in the best Göttingen International Handel Festival production I've seen, Carlos Wagner's take on the jewel-laden Lotario with a superb young team led by mezzo Sophie Rennert and soprano Marie Lys (pictured above by Alciro Theodoro da Silva). Their slimmed-down concert staging for children proved just as delightful, a model of how to open up opera to all.The Royal Opera again struck golden heartbreak with its Madama Butterfly heroine in the still-beautiful Caurier and Leiser production, the dare-all young diva Ermonela Jaho (sadly it also claims turkey of the year in outgoing Artist Director Kasper Holten's messy production of Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, which is not to return). Operatic partnerships don't get much better than Jaho's partnership with the best Puccini conductor alive, also the Royal Opera's Music Director, Antonio Pappano. Michael Chance's takeover at what we must now call the Grange Festival near Winchester included a sparkling team in veteran John Copley's laugh-out-loud funny (but never overdone) production of Britten's Albert Herring, with Orla Boylan's Lady Billows imperiously leading the Loxford and District May Day plans. And I'm sorry to have missed the fun of a last choice, timewise too, relished by Gavin Dixon and commended by Jessica Duchen, as Simon Rattle and a fine team had fun with Bernstein's Wonderful Town at the Barbican (""Conga!"" pictured above by Mark Allan). We'll be seeing more of Sir Simon in the Classical choice tomorrow.Next page: watch the Opera Holland Park encore for the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/best-2017-opera,
67,"Cendrillon, RNCM, Manchester review - magic and spectacle",Cendrillon,RNCM,2017-12-15,Robert Beale,"The Royal Northern College of Music’s production of Massenet’s Cendrillon has a particularly strong professional production team, and it shows. This is one of the most attractively spectacular operas the college has mounted for years.Director Olivia Fuchs and designer Yannis Thavoris stage the story in Versailles (the Hall of Mirrors, in particular) in the era of Louis XIV, and the set makes a wall of two-way mirrors its abiding theme, providing not only for impressive visual effects but also an easy and symbolic transition from the home of Cendrillon and her nasty step-mother and sisters to the royal palace and back again. Costumes are lavish, and the technical credits include no less than 12 people responsible, one way or another, for wigs!The story in this 1899 Cinderella is essentially Perrault’s, but with some clever twists. Cendrillon’s step-mother, Madame de le Haltière, is a vainglorious would-be society lady, while her husband, Pandolfe, put-upon and longing for peace without her, has a considerable comedy role. The third and fourth acts (after the ball) show Cendrillon and Pandolfe planning to leave the other three for their former home, then Cendrillon wanting to end her own life, followed by a scene in which the Prince and Cendrillon are together and yet unable to see each other; she begins a slow convalescence – before the conventional ending with the lost slipper used to identify the true belle of the ball (pictured below: the ball scene with Rebecca Barry as Madame de le Haltière with Eliza Boom and Lucy Vallis as the two nasty sisters). It sounds pedestrian in terms like these, but Fuchs and Thavoris have mixed some surreally up-to-date imagery with the 17th century settings (including a Cadillac-style vehicle for Cinders to get to the ball – first presented as a model car and then evoked, on the fall of the curtain, by a silhouette and light show). Instead of acts three and four offering forests and enchanted shrubbery, we are in a sanatorium, with nuns on roller skates and Cendrillon and the Prince each attached to a bed-side drip. La Fée (the Fairy Godmother, as we usually know her), who has previously appeared suitably magical, with lights in her hair and a similar get-up for her friendly Sprites, now dons a white coat and administers healing touches.Crazy? Well, it works, and since we have already seen evidence of the teenage angst of both Cendrillon (a feisty, somewhat wilful and independent girl) and the Prince (first seen moping in his room as he carves “L’Inconnue” – the girl of his dreams – on his bedhead, and later indulging in a few tantrums of his own), the idea of clinical intervention does not seem too far-fetched.The music is in the capable hands of Martin André and RNCM chorus master Kevin Thraves. The RNCM always fields a big chorus for opera when it can, and with Massenet’s turn-of-the-century orchestral writing there are powerful sounds coming from stage and pit. At first these verged towards the loud and raucous, and choral ensemble was a little messy before things bedded in. Later, we heard excellently delicate playing – particularly in the accompaniment to the duet which leads to the sanatorium scene (originally a Forest Murmurs in its own right), and by the finale they were firing on all cylinders and splendidly so. There are two casts for the principal roles in this opera (regular practice at the RNCM now) and I have seen only one of them. Those I heard included lovely coloratura singing from Daniella Sicari as La Fée (pictured above), with warmth and outstanding accuracy and attack, a winsome-sounding and delightfully characterised Cendrillon from Fiona Finsbury, and a very finely developing voice from Kamil Bień as Le Prince Charmant. The RNCM has decided to present this as a tenor role, whatever purists may think about faithfulness to the old French travestie tradition, and rightly. His singing in “Toi qui m’es apparue” and the succeeding duet was very good indeed.John Ieuan Jones had the personality and strength to do justice to Pandolfe, and Rebecca Barry was theatrically alert as Madame de le Haltière as well as singing with real class. Comic acting came well, too, to the nasty sisters Noémie and Dorothée, played by Eliza Boom and Lucy Vallis (a delightful trio from those last three at the beginning of Act Three), and the various comic male roles which help enliven the palace scenes.In fact, the comedic quality of the chorus was a joy in itself, and rounded the whole evening off in the colourful finale. Working with student performers is always a matter of harnessing their limitless enthusiasm while guarding against the pitfalls of their relative inexperience, and in this aspect Olivia Fuchs has triumphed.@RobertBealeMcr",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/cendrillon-rncm-manchester-review-magic-and-spectacle,4
68,"Cavalleria Rusticana/Pagliacci, Royal Opera review - one tenor, two samey brutes",Cavalleria Rusticana/Pagliacci,Royal Opera,2017-12-04,David Nice,"Are ""Cav and Pag"" inseparable? Clearly not, to judge from Opera North's ""Little Greats"" and elsewhere, but it's still the pairing of choice. Tricky, because as music-theatre, Leoncavallo's drama of rough life entwined with rough art stands high above Mascagni's Sicilian village shenanigans, despite great scenes and numbers in both. Director Damiano Michieletto, with his more than superficial connections between the two, has already been praised for solving some of the disparities (not least the fact that Cavalleria Rusticana takes a good quarter of an hour to get started). In this Royal Opera revival tenor Bryan Hymel, bravely taking on both the rustic lad and the violent trouper for three performances, initiates different problems by offering no notable dramatic or vocal differences between the two tenor roles.The voice certainly stays the course. Not quite the necessary dash of Italian sunshine there, and a bit of bottling up top; but the sobs around the notes are authentic enough. But these are samey brutes, not helped by Michieletto's insistence on physically violent characterisations, as far as they go, which make Turiddu's too-late concern for his discarded Santuzza seem implausible and insanely jealous Canio's declaration that he loves his wife a mockery. Hymel sings Pagliacci's hit number, ""Vesti la giubba"" (""On with the motley"") with intensity, but it doesn't come from a deep place, and he sticks with the stock laughter before the aria and the sobs after the last phrase. A tougher director than Rodula Gaitanou, responsible for this revival, would have insisted on cutting all that out.Both operas inhabit dark places in Paolo Fantin's sets. Strip lighting in the bakery stays on against a sombre background throughout Cav, despite the chorus singing of orange-blossom and larks; no summer evening light breaks through the school hall where the action of this Pag takes place, making it difficult for Nedda to ""see"" the birds whose freedom she envies.Carmen Giannattasio (pictured above with Simon Keenlyside as Tonio and Hymel as Canio) returns as a flinty strolling player, complete with a nuanced young village lover in 23-year old Andrzej Filończyk's Silvio, but it's Elīna Garanča as Santuzza who gives the most fully rounded performance. Her mezzo lustre never struggles with the high flares of what has always seemed more a soprano part (like Carmen, a role in which Garanča also excels, uniquely in my experience). Michieletto sets her up as the village outcast, as prone to visions – a judgmental statue of the Virgin – as Canio is in seeing lovers everywhere, with the director taking his most daring gambit in moving the play-within-a-play off the tiny village stage and into Canio's mind.There are solid, one-dimensional performances (is more required?) from Mark S Doss as mafia boss – originally carter – Alfio in the Mascagni and Simon Keenlyside as a loud, burnished Tonio whose gestures don't quite add up and who, as originally intended, gets the final line - ""la commedia è finita!"" - after Leoncavallo's bloodbath (unfortunately the spotlight didn't fall on him on opening night) .Elena Zilio is required to do a lot of rather stagy acting as Turiddu's mother, undermined by being made up as more of a nonna than a mamma, Sicilian village life's ageing propensity notwithstanding. Choruses young and old relish their lively turns, but there's a touch too much restraint here and elsewhere from the conducting of Daniel Oren. Some set pieces for the strings are consciously urged; too much else is underfired, fatally so in the closing stages of Pagliacci. It's an engaging evening, but never a hair-raising one.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/cavalleria-rusticanapagliacci-royal-opera-review-one-tenor-two-samey-brutes,3
69,"I, Object review - this operatic double-bill delivers just a single hit",I,Object,2017-12-02,alexandra Coghlan,"A comma divides the title of this opera double-bill in two, but the works paired here (Michael Nyman’s The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Kate Whitley’s Unknown Position) each explore what happens when you take it away – when natural divisions, between human and object, self and other, perception and reality are dissolved, dismantled or elided. It’s an interesting premise, but one that only translates here into a single interesting opera.A bit of a buzz is building around young British composer Kate Whitley. A recent NMC release of her works gives a taste of a musician with a wonderfully precise language in which little is wasted, and nothing feels purely decorative or gratuitous. Her music also has the capacity to be genuinely dramatic which, after a spate of oratori-operas on main stages around the world, should immediately catapult her up the commissioning list.Premiered in 2011, the two-hander Unknown Position takes real-life stories of people drawn to forge relationships with inanimate objects – including (but not limited to) a fairground ride, a sound-desk, and the Eiffel Tower – as its unlikely starting point. The action itself is simple: a young woman fights with her partner, before expressing her love for a chair.Whitley and collaborator Emma Hogan are alive both to the absurdity and the pathos of the situation, treading carefully through their sensitive subject matter to produce a taut, tightly constructed work which brims with character. Wonderfully limpid instrumental writing offers stains and sweeps of colour (there are some striking moments for tuned percussion, in particular) without ever clotting the texture. Interestingly the band is considerably larger than for the Nyman, but deployed in such a way that the voices ride easily above it, never having to fight to be heard.Enchanting soprano Raphaela Papadakis (pictured right) made a complicated Woman, her mercurial moods driving the unshowy rhetoric of her vocal lines (which pull off the rare feat of making a contemporary, vernacular libretto sound quite natural). Her bright, pointed tone swelled into fullness for her love aria – a nice contrast to Nathan Vale’s cooler tenor, collapsing into speech just as the Woman releases into song. At barely half-an-hour in length this is a tantalising hint of an opera, a promise (hopefully) of things to come.The same cannot be said of Michael Nyman’s The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat. Premiered at the ICA 30 years ago, there’s some logic to restoring it to the venue in this revival, but otherwise I can see little reason for digging it out of retirement. Unlike Philip Glass’s operatic minimalism, where repetition achieves a transformative ritual weight, Nyman’s simply numbs the ear – neither witty or glossy enough nor musically substantive enough to sustain the length of an opera, certainly not one with quite as much plot to cram in as this.The Man feels like a wordy slog from its first bars, and nothing that conductor Mark Biggins could do with his onstage band lessened their deadening impact on voices, smothering them and their all-important text in empty clatter and chug. The writing, both for voices and instruments, is ungrateful, exhausting, and both Papadakis and, most obviously, Vale – a late step-in for this performance – tired audibly, with only bass-baritone Joseph Padfield surviving unscathed. Tone wobbled, tuning suffered in the band, and everything felt uncertain. Rosalind Parker’s minimal production (making judicious use of projections) just about kept things moving, but there’s a limit to the salvage work any director can do here. After the cogent wit and youthful brio of the Whitley, this just felt like the pompous meanderings of the club bore.@AlexaCoghlan",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/i-object-review-operatic-double-bill-delivers-just-single-hit,3
70,"Falstaff, RLPO, Petrenko, Liverpool Philharmonic Hall review - Bryn Terfel leads a merry dance",Falstaff,RLPO,2017-11-27,David Nice,"Even seemingly immortal singers grow old. Sir Bryn is closer to the ""Martinmas summer"" of Shakespeare's and Verdi's Sir John than when first he put on the fat suit at the Royal Opera 18 years ago. Even if he walks the gouty walk that matches the belly, vocally he seems richer than ever. Maybe not quite the definitive operatic Falstaff of our era - that honour falls to Ambrogio Maestri - but a suitable planet for the variable young moons of Liverpool's European Opera Centre to revolve around, at least two of them shining bright. With the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra very much present on stage, mostly behind Amy Lane's concert staging, this was always going to be a classy realisation of Verdi's inexhaustible comic swansong.Not that Vasily Petrenko is quite the born opera conductor. He doesn't seem to relish every orchestral burp, titter and cheerful song that make his players equal partners in the action. Though he looks round occasionally to the singers, he rarely accompanies them so closely; that became immediately apparent when the jabbing that goes with Dr Caius's demand for an answer wasn't quite in sync with the singer (though tenor William Morgan worked alongside Max Zander's Bardolph and Lancelot Nomura's Pistol to serve up the righ comic side dishes).The razor-sharp buoyancy that lifts the greatest of Falstaffs, the kind we've had from Abbado and Jurowski, only fitfully surfaced in orchestral passages (the uproar around ""Va, vecchio John,"" for instance). But the Liverpool strings were a model of personality, forged by Petrenko over the years, from the brilliance of the tavern scenes to the exquisite fade of the Polonaise to which the Windsor folk anticipate the final gulling. And among the pleasurable details you don't always hear from the pit were the military trumpets when Falstaff tells the disguised Ford that ""gold is a good captain that marches ahead"". There are always new things to hear in this treasure-trove of a score.Lovely cor anglais playing, too, from Anna Wheal.Two scenes worked as well as I've ever heard them, with Act Two Scene One's visitors to the Garter Inn. Young Polish mezzo Wanda Franek  may well be the most voluptuous Mistress Quickly the opera has ever seen; most important, she has the comic chest tones for ""reverenza"" and ""povera donna"". With time, could she become the Amneris and Azucena the world so badly needs? And I've never seen baritone Mark Stone (pictured above with Terfel), stepping in for Anthony Clark Evans, give a better performance than this Ford; it's no small order to match Terfel for tone and character, but his energised acting was absolutely up to the mark and the jealousy aria gave the biggest goosebumps in the show.The other experienced trouper, Terfel's fellow Welsh singer Rebecca Evans (pictured below on the right with Barbara Massaro's Nannetta, Franek and Anna Dowsley), produced the ideal expansive phrasing for Alice Ford's mockery of her ""shining star"" over lecherous Falstaff in an otherwise not quite crisp enough first ensemble scene - there seemed to be a bit of wrong-footing in Act 2 Scene 2's ""gaie comare di Windsor"", too - and her sense of fun was ideal for the merriest of wives; Australian Anna Dowsley still did what she could as the ever-overshadowed Meg Page.Where youth mattered most, it didn't quite shine. Barbara Massaro needs to pull the core tone into focus, though she floated some of Nannetta's top notes rather well; Turkish tenor Murat Can Guven should be useful in less nuanced tenor roles than the scrupulous-sensitive Fenton, whose Windsor Forest solo lacked moonshine (not so Timothy Jackson's magical offstage horn). Petrenko took their two little duets in their first scenes together too ponderously.There was enough fun in Lane's staging, complicit with lively side-titles, to have the audience constantly laughing out loud, and Terfel gallery of gags kept it focused. Fine-tuning might have included a fuller basket of laundry - and what there was, it should have been remembered, is dirty, so hardly much point in folding it up. And couldn't the ""fairies"" have been allowed to really pinch and poke the horned Falstaff?Tim Baxter's videos high on the back wall had lots of charm, not least in painting pretty nature-scenes that had us yearning for spring and summer, and came together with the lively young chorus's twinkling lights in the final scene. And yes, this sent us out feeling much better than we'd come in, though with a masterstroke of a caution in Falstaff's piano solo ""tutti gabbati"" (""all are mocked"") before the final joyous blaze of the great fugue; only a charisma as big as Terfel's could have held the audience in the silence around that the way he did.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/falstaff-rlpo-petrenko-liverpool-philharmonic-hall-review-bryn-terfel-leads-merry-dance,4
71,"The Bear, Mid Wales Opera review - small stage, big ambitions",The Bear,Mid Wales Opera,2017-11-25,Richard Bratby,"Go west, opera-lover: Mid Wales Opera is back in business. In fact, it’s been back since spring this year, when it toured venues in Wales and England with a warmly reviewed Handel Semele and a striking (and impressively cast) Magic Flute inspired by 1970s British sci-fi. That was the first production under the company’s new artistic leadership of Jonathan Lyness and Richard Studer – a conductor/director team with considerable form and substantial ambitions. This spirited chamber staging of Walton’s 1967 “extravaganza in one act” The Bear – MWO’s third new production this year – is modest in scale, but uncompromising in quality.And if opera on this budget is about the art of the possible, Lyness and Studer have made a shrewd choice. Written for Aldeburgh (apparently the original suggestion came from Peter Pears), The Bear is a 50-minute squib by Chekhov, translated and adapted by Paul Dehn and set by Walton for just three singers plus a 15-piece orchestra. The heart of the story is an extended squabble between two neighbours, the widow Yelena Popova and the bluff Grigory Stepanovich Smirnov (the “Bear”). He needs to collect on a debt; she resents any interruption to her mourning routine. They bicker, then rage: Smirnov cites sexual equality and demands a duel. Pistols are drawn before they realise – and I don't honestly think this counts as a spoiler alert – that they’re actually perfect for each other.It doesn’t sound much, and Studer’s production (he doubles as designer) keeps the action in Chekhov’s single room, while Lyness has shrunk Walton’s ensemble even further to a multitasking quintet of violin, bassoon, harp, piano and percussion. But it’s got everything you need for an hour’s entertainment. The characters are vividly sketched, the situation is timeless, and the big moments are laugh-out-loud funny. And Walton’s score is a joy: sliding, smooching and spinning on a rouble from salon waltzes and shimmering sexual tension to dissonant irony and spiky musical in-jokes (a little flash of Richard Strauss when someone mentions Salome; snare drum plus self important bassoon to establish Smirnov’s ex-military credentials). The gleeful invention and youthful irreverence of Façade hovers over the whole show: a rapid-fire rejoinder to the assumption that in semi-retirement on Ischia, the old boy had lost his bite.Lyness directed from the keyboard, and it all swung along with zest and relatively few of the balance problems you might expect from a performance in a church (St Mary’s Hay-on-Wye hosted this particular stop on MWO’s 16-date tour). “It’s no good pretending it’s Three Sisters,” Walton is reported to have said, and MWO’s central pair each dialled their performance a generous notch up from naturalism. Carolyn Dobbin, as Popova, has an extraordinarily flexible face, emoting grandly before the portrait of her dead husband, then pouring herself another vodka with a sly smile – a very merry widow indeed, with a sunny, flexible mezzo that could convey both steely hauteur and a deepening tenderness. Adam Green’s Smirnov clomped onstage in riding boots and a massive fur hat, and his singing had at least as much Russian blackness as the role required. His is a big, handsome voice that rang slightly hollow when he blustered, and was warmest in his puzzled asides: again, precisely as the part demanded.With Matthew Buswell (pictured above with Carolyn Dobbin) playing the servant Luka as an embattled voice of reason (his measured singing made a droll contrast to his mounting catalogue of injuries: collateral damage in Smirnov and Popova’s increasingly excitable clashes), there was more than enough humanity here to make Chekhov’s caricatures live. Studer’s direction didn’t stint on physical comedy, either: the characters brandished chairs, swigged vodka and jumped on furniture with exuberant enthusiasm and as much dignity as can be maintained when you’re wearing a pair of purple plaid trousers. The set comprised little more than a swatch of wallpaper, a patch of astroturf and some lighting stands that doubled as stylised birch trees – necessary for a production designed to tour small venues ranging from village halls on the Lleyn peninsula to the Ammanford Miners’ Theatre.But Lyness and Studer understand the essentials of opera on any scale, and The Bear successfully creates a world and fills it with funny, touching life. I couldn’t stay for the evening’s second half – a sort of preview of MWO’s big spring 2018 production of Eugene Onegin – though it’s hard to imagine a better advertisement for this company’s enterprising ethos and high artistic values than the performance we’d just witnessed. Onegin will be worth seeing; meanwhile The Bear proves that Mid Wales Opera, recently assumed to be defunct, was only ever hibernating. It’s woken with a roar.@RichardBratby",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/bear-mid-wales-opera-review-small-stage-big-ambitions,4
72,"The Rake's Progress, Wilton's Music Hall review - mercurial Stravinsky made cumbersome",The Rake's Progress,Wilton's Music Hall,2017-11-21,David Nice,"If you're not going to mention the imaginative genius of Stravinsky, Auden and Kallman within the covers of your programme, and the only article, by the director, is titled ""Acting Naturally"", then the production had better deliver. That remarkable actor Selina Cadell's eloquent words, both there and in a ""First Person"" piece on theartsdesk, promise more than actually emerges in a debut staging from the lavishly-supported OperaGlass Works which doesn't even have the curiosity value of going daringly wrong. Between them Cadell and her curiously un-buoyant conductor, Laurence Cummings, much more sprightly on Handelian home territory, never fully honour a fine team of singers and instrumentalists.I take one of Cadell's key points, that performers should engage more directly with the audience. In a work which starts with Stravinsky's typical inverted commas around the word ""heart"", only to glide into a terrifying earnestness beneath the facade by the time we reach the last two scenes as weak-willed Tom Rakewell finds himself first in a graveyard and then in a madhouse, that's a mixed blessing.It's a sadness that the production Stravinsky treasured most, that by Ingmar Bergman in Stockholm, is lost to posterity, but we do have Bergman's Magic Flute, the greatest, surely, of all opera films, to hint at what might have been achieved: it starts with a pretty recreation of the Drottningholm theatre, all delightful painted flats and much addressing of the audience, but strips away the illusion in the second act. Stravinsky being equal to Mozart in his variousness, a similar sense that we're no longer asked to be directly complicit – with a bit too much ""like me"" about it for my taste last night – but finally inside the characters' heads was missing last night.Given an audience ready to titter at just about anything, and lights full up, the power of Nick Shadow's attempt to claim Tom's soul didn't stand a chance. A rigidly 18th century London with the occasional reference to Hogarth's series, though without wigs and only using minimal props – albeit with a nice touch in Cummings dressed up as his god, Mr Handel – fails to mark the full historical range of Stravinsky's musical mystery tour. Hockney at Glyndebourne got away with it; the Brechtian austerity of Tom Piper's sets and the splashes of colour in Rosalind Ebbutt's pretty costumes weren't enough. Several numbers delivered from the balconies were completely lost on the sizeable proportion of the audience seated beneath them.Nor did those exquisite endpapers, a pastoral idyll at the start and a masque-like final catering for Stravinsky's deep myths of rebirth in Bedlam, have the eyes pricking as they can when the conducting is more deft, the instrumental lines more beautifully phrased than the young players of the Southbank Sinfonia were encouraged to make them (no problem at all, though, with the restricted forces). We did at least have two master colourists in tenor Robert Murray as Tom and Susanna Hurrell as his Anne Trulove (pictured above), though the sense of callow youth trying, however feebly, to find his way was lost in casting an older tenor. Jonathan Lemalu had light and shade in his singing, too, though perhaps not enough menace and authority. Even Victoria Simmonds as Baba the Turk (pictured above), the bearded lady of St Giles' Fair whom Tom is urged to marry as an existential jest, didn't get the best context from Cadell; was it health and safety which prevented any crockery from being smashed at such close proximity to the audience in her breakfast vengeance aria? Nevertheless much expressive use of her well-made-up eyes – pity the beard had to be a paint job – and full mezzo dudgeon gave the cue for the fullest laughter of the evening.The chorus of eight needed much more help with their acting; Mother Goose's brothel served up Roaring Boys with all the threat of the men in an English cathedral choir and a bit of vague moue-ing from the tarts. But musically they were very much on the ball, and not even minimal staging could sink the Broadway-style scene in which Baba's and scamster bankrupt Tom's possessions go up for sale; it made you realise how much theatre is in Stravinsky's brilliant setting of some of Auden's and/or Kallman's funniest lines. Indeed, in everything this under-nuanced production didn't achieve, one was reminded of the original's full, amazing potential. That's not much help, though, for those seeing a masterpiece for the first time, one sadly sold short.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/rakes-progress-wiltons-music-hall-review-mercurial-stravinsky-made-cumbersome,3
73,"Semiramide, Royal Opera review - Rossini's Queen is back",Semiramide,Royal Opera,2017-11-20,william Ward,"It has long been a mystery why no new production of Semiramide should have been staged at Covent Garden since 1887: un offesa terribile considering that this splendid melodramma tragico should have been the inaugural production of the Royal Italian Opera House (our current theatre’s predecessor) in 1847.In fact much of Rossini’s repertoire, both comic and tragic, fell out of favour worldwide from about the time of Queen Victoria’s Golden Jubilee, partly as a disappearance of such star lead sopranos such as Adelina Patti and Nellie Melba. So with the exception of a couple of propaganda-driven revivals in Nazi Germany (1932) and Fascist Italy (1940), there was almost no interest shown in this tragic melodrama, the finest and most complete flowering of Rossini’s highly creative Neapolitan period, until the postwar period, when it became the perfect vehicle for the florid, powerhouse singing machines of Callas and Sutherland – and much later Monserrat Caballé.The huge contemporary revival in Rossini’s fortunes, driven above all by the massive success of the Rossini Opera Festival in his home town of Pesaro, has been an important vector for the careers of Ruggero Raimondi, Samuel Ramey, Marilyn Horne, Juan Diego Flórez as well as Caballé for whom Semiramide in particular became a signature role.However, Covent Garden has corrected this historical oversight with a staging which from a musical and directional perspective is little short of impeccable. But then how could it fail with the world’s currently favourite lyric-coloratura mezzo, Joyce DiDonato, in the title role, channeling both the intensely interiorised melodramatic contours of the eponymous Assyrian regal villain, referencing Freudian anguish in her incestuous amorous dilemma, and the ballsy showstopping proto-romantic diva of the grand Italian tradition?DiDonato inhabits the role of the doomed Queen Semiramide with an ease and a generosity towards her fellow performers that looks likely to set a benchmark for future productions. Antonio Pappano's Rossini conducting with its attention to detail, his tendency to highlight the empathic effect of the wind instruments (so present in Rossini’s scores) in dialogue with the exact texture of each singing voice, made for perfect synergy between stage and pit.If the deliberate and gallant complicity between DiDonato and Pappano underpins the whole performance, it was noticeable by its absence in the performance of the acclaimed Rossini specialist Daniela Barcellona in the mezzo trouser role of Arsace (pictured above with DiDonato), a dashing general in the Assyrian army, Semiramide’s love interest, and incidentally her long-lost son. Barcellona’s technique is faultess (although perhaps a little soggy at the lower end), her ranging athletic physique du rôle ideal. But there is no hint in her performance to indicate that fatal intimacy with her (his) prospective lover (or mother), upon which the psychological crux of the opera should surely rest. And she has had time to get this right: she and DiDonato are reprising their roles from the Munich cast of this same production, from February this year.An evident favourite of Covent Garden audiences, American tenor Lawrence Brownlee (pictured above with DiDonato) made for an effective, impassioned Indian prince Idreno. His love interest Azema was creditably sung by the young American soprano Jacquelyn Stucker in a rather odd floor-length golden Azzedine Alaia-inspired sheath dress cum straightjacket. Hungarian bass Bálint Szabó interpreted the almost narrator-like role of Oroe as a Rasputin-like high priest. A special mention also to both Michele Pertusi (pictured below) and Mirco Palazzi as the Iago-like scheming but thwarted general Assur: both excellent performers, whose differing vocal styles and stage presences we were able to compare between the two acts when Pertusi was replaced by Palazzi due to illness.The strategic advantage of packing Italian-trained rossiniani like Barcellona, Pertusi and Palazzi into a brand new British production like this is not only about their perfect skills in elocuting Gaetano Rossi’s 1823 libretto (based on Voltaire’s 1749 novel Semiramis), but in their instinctive understanding of how Rossini’s broad musical theory actually works. Without benefit of the deep and pioneering ricerca critica of the last half-century or so, driven largely by the Pesaro Festival and the critical editions sponsored by the legendary Milanese music publishers Casa Ricordi, it is hard for North European/American ears fully to appreciate the refinement and complexities in the work of this missing link between the Baroque and the Romantic operatic traditions. Wonderfully, both Pappano and DiDonato totally get it.David Alden’s production is reliably efficient and functional, fully exploiting the resources of the Covent Garden stage both vertically and horizontally. Tiresomely predictable however, the sets and costumes by Paul Steinberg and Buki Shiff respectively: the same old same old mishmash of eras and cultures evoked with that sort of post-post modern legerdemain that is so long past its sell-by date. A gigantic statue of the Assyrian god Baal resembling a contemporary Central Asian dictator, lurid gigantographs of the now dead King Nino resembling Donald Trump with blond comb-over and dark glasses. Absolute Baal-oney.A dressing-up box assortment of culturally misappropriated costumes and uniforms that 20 or 30 years ago might have seemed cutting-edge, but now look oh-so-so last century. Only floor-length black leather coats (a ROH/ENO staple, along with edgy-looking Raybans) seemed to have been left out. Rossini always played to the gallery, but he was never a fool for cheap pantomime pastiche.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/semiramide-royal-opera-review-rossinis-queen-back,4
74,"Marnie, English National Opera review – hyped new opera doesn’t hit the heights",Marnie,English National Opera  – hyped new opera doesn’t hit the heights,2017-11-19,Bernard Hughes,"The great and good of the London music scene were gathered at English National Opera last night for the unveiling of American Wunderkind Nico Muhly’s new opera, Marnie. Although it was commissioned by the Met in New York, somehow ENO managed to wangle the world premiere, which has been widely hyped and was ecstatically received by a packed house. But for all that there was much to enjoy, it hardly deserved such rapture, and there were problems with both piece and production.Marnie is a 1964 psychological thriller by Alfred Hitchcock, based on the Winston Graham novel of 1961. The opera looks more to the novel than the film (although the programme declares the production is “by special arrangement with Universal Pictures”). The English setting is restored, making more sense of the hunting scene, as are a number of characters and a more ambivalent ending.I watched the Hitchcock Marnie in preparation for the opera and didn’t like its melodrama or its, for me, overblown Bernard Herrmann score. Muhly’s music is definitely more self-controlled and acute – ironically in a sense less “operatic” – but the story remains sensational and histrionic. It tells of a woman who moves from secretarial job to job in provincial England stealing money from her employers before changing her identity and repeating the process. She is a liar and a thief, sexually alluring although sex-averse, with her behaviour guided by a deep guilt about a violent incident in her childhood.Marnie is blackmailed into marriage by the businessman Mark Rutland, who knows about her thefts, but when he tries to rape her, Marnie attempts suicide (strangely, this is not mentioned again). In the final scene the truth of the incident in Marnie’s childhood relieves her of her decades of guilt. As the police move in to arrest her, she declares “I’m free.”The production (designed by Julian Crouch) is visually pleasing, combining naturalistic period furniture and costume with more abstracted animated projections. The costuming offered some lovely tableaus of acres of grey office dress with Marnie alone in a bright colour. Sasha Cooke as Marnie (pictured above with Daniel Okulitch) sang beautifully, especially in her reflective arias placed between the main scenes, her tone rich and expressive. Marnie is usually accompanied by a quartet of “Shadow Marnies”, echoing and decorating her lines in what Muhly describes as “an early music style”.Countertenor James Laing impressed as Mark’s brother Terry but Mark Rutland himself, sung by Daniel Okulitch, was a little underpowered. The chorus, extensively used, were in good voice, whether as office workers, hunters or funeral hymn-singers.Muhly’s music is colourful and inventive. He clearly has no shortage of ideas, as his astonishingly prodigious output shows – according to the programme, he has written over 100 pieces since his opera Two Boys arrived at ENO in 2011. In style the music is closest to John Adams, with post-minimalist pulsing textures and a largely diatonic, if not tonal, harmonic vocabulary. But there weren’t the moments either of orchestral or melodic magic that light up, for example, Nixon in China, and that remain in mind after the show has ended.The scoring was sufficiently spare that the voices mostly cut through (and overscoring is a common failing in contemporary opera), but there were times Muhly’s favoured skittering flutes obscured important words. Conductor Martyn Brabbins kept everything on a tight rein, and trumpets and percussion were on good form. The unforgiving oboe part, identified with the character of Marnie, resulted in some issues of intonation, and the lines written for the treble, sung by William Brady, were thankless, if not downright unkind.The biggest problems were, perhaps, in the libretto. First there was so much story to be got through that a lot of the dialogue was mundane exchanges of plot information. A related problem was that, although not falling into the familiar trap of verbosity, the leanness of the libretto meant a shortage of poetry. And there were some unforgivable lapses into banality, such as Mark’s final line “I’m here for you”, to which Marnie replies “I’ll be there for myself”. I winced.The production, directed by Michael Mayer, combined naturalistic scenes with stylised elements such as the “Shadow Marnies”. Other stylisations were less successful, most notably the horse-riding accident, which was always going to be difficult to stage convincingly, but was overlong and, in the writhing of the group of dancers, a bit silly.Ultimately, the difficulty is in sympathising with the central character, whose unknowability is mysterious but also alienating. The book is in the first person, and the interest is in what Marnie reveals despite herself. As portrayed from outside, it is unclear what attracts Mark – whose attempted sexual assault of Marnie obviously makes him less appealing. So while there were many good things to enjoy, the whole thing did not offer as engaging a theatrical experience as Benjamin's Written on Skin, for me the benchmark for 21st century opera.

Royal Opera were clearly expecting great things, even from the start, and this is the third cast to have presented the show, after two separately cast runs last year, and a commercial DVD is also available. Mitchell has repaid their confidence with an impressively conceived production: visually arresting, suitably dramatic and with many subtle narrative additions. Add to all that an impressive revival cast and excellent conducting, and the production’s fortunes seem secure.Donizetti and his librettist, Salvadore Cammarano, based their 1835 opera on a recently published novel by Walter Scott. It is a story of love and betrayal in the Scottish Highlands: Lucia (Lisette Oropesa) is in love with Edgardo (Charles Castronovo), but he is the rival of her brother, Enrico (Christopher Maltman, pictured below with Andrew Tortise as Normanno), who forces her to marry Arturo (Konu Kim) to seal an alliance. Murder ensues, and madness, with the story spiralling into bloodshed and tragedy. In the libretto, much of the violence is unseen – Lucia’s murder of Arturo and her own suicide – but Mitchell and designer Vicki Mortimer take a different approach. The stage is divided throughout, on one side the public spaces in which the story plays out, and the other side Lucia’s private rooms. This allows the off-stage action to be graphically represented.The production has been described, both by Royal Opera publicity and by Mitchell herself, as feminist, and the opera itself has a strong feminist angle, in terms of Lucia’s agency and the consequences for all the male characters who attempt to control her life. But Mitchell makes an important stand by adjusting the gender balance of the cast. As the libretto stands, there are only two female singing roles, Lucia herself and her maid, Alisa (Rachel Lloyd pictured below, left). But at the opening of the opera, Lucia sees a vision of a ghost (Sacha Plaige), one of her ancestors murdered in the ongoing family feud.Mitchell brings this ghostly apparition back in almost every scene. Lucia has also recently lost her mother (Sarah Northgraves), whose ghost too makes regular appearances. These are the sorts of additions that make up the second stage, suitably low-key but always suggestive. At the other end of the scale is the sadomasochistic murder of Arturo by Lucia and Alisa. An audacious twist to the story is Lucia’s pregnancy by Edgardo, and the murder is followed by an equally graphic miscarriage, a clever device, as it contextualises the mad scene that follows.Although there are nine named singing roles, most have very little music, placing heavy emphasis on the three leads, and all are superb here. Lucia is sung by Lisette Oropesa, here making her house debut. Her voice isn’t large, but she is a true coloratura soprano. She has excellent support for the long fioratura lines, and ideal agility for the runs and ornaments. Her Mad Scene (flutes here, no glass harmonica) is more about dramatic conviction than vocal acrobatics, but is no less impressive for it.The other outstanding voice is Christopher Maltman, making his role debut as Enrico (pictured below with Lisette Oropesa, left, and Rachael Lloyd, right). He’s the nearest the story has to an outright villain, and Maltman is a menacing presence throughout, both physically and vocally. Charles Castronovo, as Edgardo, is the only member of the original cast to return for the revival, though Ismael Jordi sings the role later in the run. Castronovo has a classic old-fashioned Italianate tenor (he’s actually American), bringing an air of tradition for those smarting at the innovations in the production.Michele Mariotti conducts with an innate sense of the bel canto style, never hurrying the singers but always maintaining the flow and dramatic tension, especially at the turbulent conclusion of the second act, which is particularly well paced. The chorus (in which all the women are dressed as men – a nice touch) are poorly served by the set, which always cramps them into a corner of the stage, but rise to the challenge; some poor ensemble in the opening number proved not to be indicative and they soon found their form. The orchestra looks unusually small but sounds suitably grand. Special mention for the principal flute, Margaret Campbell, and the harpist, Emma Granger, both on fine form for their respective solos.This is a gruelling Lucia di Lammermoor, creepy, violent and intense. But that’s how it should be, and this excellent production is fully deserving of a second showing, especially with such a fine revival cast.@saquabote",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/lucia-di-lammermoor-royal-opera-review-creepy-violent-and-intense,4
76,"The Consul, Guildhall School review - blowsy melodrama rooted by committed students",The Consul,Guildhall School,2017-10-31,David Nice,"Fancy that: the day after the last major Menotti staging I can remember in the UK, The Medium at the Edinburgh Festival, ""splendid piece of post-Puccinian grand guignol"" turned up in two different reviews (moral: don't discuss the performance with your colleagues). ""Dated piece of post-Puccinian absurdist melodrama"" might be a bit harsh but not so wide of the mark in the case of The Consul, his late 1940s fantasy rooted in the horrors of totalitarianism and western bureaucracy. Certainly the Guildhall School students, conductor and production team gave it the best possible chance, making it work where it can.Passing masterstrokes mean it can't be entirely dismissed as a period-piece, the operatic equivalent of that derogatory term the ""well-made play"", or Lloyd-Webber compared to the Sondheim of serious musical-theatre triumphs. There's so much self-sabotage here in whoring after the public taste: a kitchen-sink-drama family burst into an ill-prepared trio after an excess of blaring angst, while other set-pieces serve the singer well but lurch out of dramatic context in a way that Puccini would never have permitted.Menotti is his own librettist, a dreadful one when it comes to Brechtian moralising (company pictured below). But there are good ideas here: the Italian popular song played on the gramophone at the beginning, one of the best bits of music in the opera; the restraint which underscores a baby's death; a spooky divertissement staged by a magician-petitioner in the consul's office; and a grand scena for the stressed-out heroine which somehow nails the situation.That was an absolute high-point here in the conviction of dramatic soprano Michelle Alexander, destined for big things if she can underpin power with a really solid technique. She acts with the voice, less so with the body; the hands need to really follow the expression of the moment, and there was some ambiguity at the beginning about whether Magda really cares when freedom-fighter husband John bursts in, wounded after a run-in with the secret police (for that matter, would you bandage a wound around a trouser leg?) The final scene, which means rooting the action to the time just before the opera – let's just say gas ovens don't do the job these days – begins compellingly, poignant high strings sensitively managed by a Guildhall Orchestra on amazing form under Timothy Redmond, and it's not Alexander's fault if Menotti blows it with a kitschy musical conclusion.Director Stephen Medcalf saves Menotti's final compromise from itself with what comes after – breathing, not music, and I probably shouldn't say more. Simon Corder, impressive as ever on a relatively low budget, designs a stage for him which keeps the Sorels' kitchen (pictured below: Alexander, Christian Valle, Benson Wilson and Chloe Latchmore) in line with the suppliants at the consulate, the floor strewn with waiting tickets, until the room swivels round to reveal the secretary's desk.Some of the acting needs to be fine-tuned, but there isn't any weak singing in the cast – how far the Guildhall has come in a decade or so. Among the rest of the first-night cast, there are stand-out performances from Chloe Latchmore as Magda's mother, convincingly aged and worn, Emily Kyte's Secretary (sometimes swamped by the ever-vivid orchestra), Claire Lees as the touching Foreign Woman, Eduard Mas Bacardit as magician Magaloff and Samantha Clarke, outstanding in her few lines as a maddened Spanish woman at the beginning of the second half. Baritonal prowess comes from Jake Muffatt's John Sorel and there's a fine bass turn from Christian Valle as a threatening Police Agent.Choreography by Victoria Newlyn tightens up what could be a loose divertissement as Magaloff hypnotises the assembled consulate crowd. It's a much-needed interlude in an angsty score, winning its place retrospectively in the second of two hokum-y dream sequences. Fitful Menotti's ideas may be, and inspiration perhaps doesn't come into the picture, but thanks to the Guildhall's best shot, and the opportunities gratefully taken by a generous team of singers, this evening is never dull.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/consul-guildhall-school-review-blowsy-melodrama-rooted-committed-students,4
77,"Crowe, The English Concert, Bicket, Milton Court review - Mozartian prima-donna perfection",Crowe,The English Concert,2017-10-26,David Nice,"Singing students from the Guildhall School should have been issued with a three-line whip to fill the inexplicably half-empty Milton Court concert hall for last night's charmer. After all, every musician, and not just sopranos, should know that this is how it ought to be done. True, an effervescent personality like Lucy Crowe's can't be simulated. But every other respect of her stunningly sung and varied Mozart can be aspired to: the relaxed, natural stance (and in this instance, knowing how to play a recalcitrant shoe heel for comedy), knowing what to do with the hands, how to execute coloratura as spine-tingling expression, not mere display, how to spin long lines and to colour the music according to the situation, with the right dramatic looks and widening of the eyes to match.True, this was culinary Mozart of the sort to make E F Benson's Lucia and Georgie affectedly exhale, two-thirds of it composed in his teens, but as with Donizetti and Bellini, when you have supreme stylists in charge, it all commands attention. There are no better period-instrument players around than Harry Bicket's band, and though the dry acoustics didn't help them out in the way that the Wigmore Hall would in the frothiest of Mozart's early Divertimenti, the D major K136 with the already-vintage humour of its six-note finale kickoff, the pleasures came thick and fast. Mozart's inner string lines were full of life and interplay, runs clean and bright.The orchestral counterpart in the concert's second half, the A major Violin Concerto K219 with its rollicking ""Turkish"" rondo episode, brought another pleasure of collaboration. The English Concert's leader, Nadja Zwiener (pictured left), may not be a born soloist with the kind of panache that Isabelle Faust brought to the even slighter G major Concerto at the Proms, and in her first entries she had a bit of an intonation problem as well as less than perfect ornamentation. But the Adagio shone with such a rare consonance between violinist and orchestra, the sort of thing that star players flying in for one rehearsal can't achieve, and by the finale, with aforementioned romp both clearly articulated, with none of the usual rushing, and laugh-out-loud exuberant, we were back to the level of what Crowe had already achieved with Bicket and co (the conductor-instrumentalist pictured below by Richard Haughton).Our great soprano didn't make it easy for herself, plunging in with Aspasia's ferocious first aria in Mitridate re di Ponto. If Crowe had been singing this role rather than the less rewarding one of seconda donna Ismene at Covent Garden, that musically rather ordinary evening might have come up to the mark of this one dazzling performance. More brilliant still was ""Ah se il crudel periglio"" from Lucio Silla, with its unbelievably well-executed runs in the recap.The necessary breather in between was the lovely ""Ruhe sanft"" from Zaide, Crowe touching and perfect of legato phrasing in dialogue with Katharina Spreckelsen's cool oboe obbligato. The maturity of Mozart begins to shine through here in the extra beauties he finds in the instrumental coda, and by the time of the ""Et incarnatus est"" from the great but unfinished C minor Mass, we are in vintage territory with not only that effortlessness of vocal writing but also the woodwind ensemble, enriching what becomes a kind of quartet-cadenza of melting beauty.Crowe also made the heart flip in the simpler, solo cadenza at the heart of ""Exsultate, jubilate"". Each time I've heard her sing it, not a note or a phrase has been out of place, and this was on the same level as last year's glorious performance with David Bates and La Nuova Musica. The bonus proved simply sublime, making the eyes prick as the earlier numbers could not: as Bicket pointed out, Mozart by the end of his life knew how to say with 40 bars what had earlier taken him 200, and with Crowe bringing extra fullness of tone to what is usually just a pretty arietta, Servilia's ""S'altro che lagrime"" from La Clemenza di Tito, we all too few in the audience came out knowing we'd heard the best that singing in concert has to offer.Next page: watch Lucy Crowe sing 'Exsultate, jubilate' at the 2016 Proms",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music-opera/crowe-english-concert-bicket-milton-court-review-mozartian-prima-donna,5
78,"Written On Skin, Melos Sinfonia, LSO St Luke's review - an ambitious musical achievement",Written On Skin,Melos Sinfonia,2017-10-22,alexandra Coghlan,"Beautiful though Katie Mitchell’s original production of Written on Skin is, George Benjamin and Martin Crimp’s opera has always felt more at home in the concert hall. Last year’s Barbican performance put Benjamin’s meticulous orchestral writing absolutely in the spotlight, but perhaps this “concert-staging” – fully directed, but minimally staged – offers the best solution yet, allowing orchestra and action to share focus in this gripping piece of musical storytelling.Because that’s the power of this rarest of things, a contemporary opera that has already found a firm foothold in the repertoire. It’s a story that seizes you in the opening bars and only tightens its grip in the taut 90 minute that follows. It doesn’t matter that you know or guess the ending; Crimp’s skill is in making inevitability utterly absorbing, while Benjamin’s is in shading each episode, each step towards tragedy, in colours as rich and compelling as any in The Boy’s illuminated book.This touring staging (which travels to Cambridge, London and St Petersburg), masterminded by the young conductor Oliver Zeffman (pictured above with Benjamin and the cast the end) and performed by the even younger professional ensemble the Melos Sinfonia, is a mightily ambitious affair. All Benjamin’s orchestra – from mandolins to viola da gamba, glass harmonica to elaborate percussion section – is accounted for, making a massive (sometimes just a little too massive) impact in the comparatively compact LSO St Luke’s.But more impressive than the sheer violence of the sonic effects here is the detail of the quieter passages, lovingly shaped by Zeffman and his band. The brittle, elusive tremor of mandolins as the illuminations work their charm on The Protector, the loaded significance of the glass harmonica that haunts and taunts Agnes as she falls under The Boy’s spell – all emerge clearly, carefully balanced.The beauty of Crimp’s libretto, whose third-person descriptions can seem mannered in the opera house, is that it fills the gaps where elaborate visuals would otherwise be. At every moment he tells us where each character is, what they are doing, so all Jack Furness’s deft staging here has to do is supplement the inner life of each episode. This he does with the help of a responsive and skilful young cast, who throw themselves at the demands of this piece without holding back.It’s Ross Ramgobin’s Protector, his smile sharp as a blade, that sets the tone. Without his ferocity, his arrogance we’d lose the note of danger that must sound from the very start. His warm baritone, clearly articulated and projected, deploys Crimp’s consonants like pistol shots, and finds plenty of colour to nuance the character’s villainy. Dominating the stage-space, Ramgobin becomes the centre, not a point, of this love-triangle.Lauran Fagan’s Agnes (pictured above with Ramgobin) is a careful study in ambiguity, playing innocence off instinctive knowledge, agency off pliant passivity. The role’s vocal demands are relentless (especially, as here, with no chance of leaving the stage for the opera’s entire duration), and if she as yet lacks a full spectrum of textural effects, the control to mirror her character’s many moods in song, she still gives us a compelling heroine.She’s hampered by a lack of chemistry with Patrick Terry’s Boy (beautifully sung, but a little too ethereal to convince as the catalyst for this sexually charged fable), who must also style out an unfortunate piece of costuming. Nick Pritchard and Bethan Langford offer strong support as the interventionist angels and relatives, rounding out a precociously strong cast.Zeffman and the Melos Sinfonia, guest artists at LSO St Luke’s this season, have definitely made their mark with this show. Ambitious and expert, it won’t be long before they’re making their mark on larger stages.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/written-skin-melos-sinfonia-lso-st-lukes-review-ambitious-musical-achievement,4
79,"The World's Wife, Wales Millennium Centre, Weston Studio review - the power and frustration behind the throne",The World's Wife,Wales Millennium Centre,2017-10-16,stephen Walsh,"How many dead female composers can you name? Tom Green, the composer of this stunning one-woman show, could initially only think of five (I managed thirteen while waiting for the show to start, but then I’ve been around somewhat longer than he has, and knew one or two of them). In any case he soon dug up a few more, and based his score entirely on more or less unrecognisable quotations from their work – or so he claims. His libretto, on the other hand, he took from a living female writer, the Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy’s eponymous collection, which examines assorted famous males through the eyes of their real or imagined wives or lovers. It’s a motley collection, not always as creditable to the wives as may have been the intention. But in Green’s hands, and more particularly those of his soprano, the brilliant Amanda Forbes, it makes excellent theatre – a theatre of sound and words, certainly, rather than action, and all the better for a certain ambiguity of aim, which helps avoid the grinding platitudes of so much feminist polemic.Accompanied only by a string quartet (the admirable Mavron Quartet, two of its members pictured above) and a small museum of busts, Forbes wanders the stage from wife to wife starting, mysteriously, with Red Riding Hood, then proceeding via Mrs Pontius Pilate, Mrs Aesop (a sort of mundane Mrs Haydn: “I could barely keep awake as the story droned on”), Herodias and Salome, Mrs Icarus – condemned, like so many wives, to watch her husband make a prize idiot of himself – Mrs Freud, and on via Anne Hathaway and Mrs Beast (of Beauty fame), to the ultimate abandoned wife, Demeter, the umpteenth Mrs Zeus. The temptation to joke about these victims of history’s sexism is by no means always resisted, by the music any more than by the poetry. Mrs Aesop chatters gibberish to her husband’s bust; Salome grinds her hips to some very unbiblical boogie-woogie. But the prevailing tone is inward, reflective, an image of the complexity of a world in which male genius (we can talk about the female sort some other time) is often outstripped by subtleties in the female psyche that go unnoticed because they lack obvious product. “Behind each player,” as Duffy puts it, “stood a line of ghosts/Unable to win,” though occasionally they did. After all Demeter produced Persephone, who invented the seasons: not a bad record to put beside The Winter’s Tale.Green’s default style here is a kind of floating arioso, sometimes supported by the quartet, sometimes not, and in the end enriched by an extraordinary polyphony of self-reflective vocalism achieved through the visible use of a hand-held loop pedal – effectively an electronic way of making a  tape-loop. The writing for quartet is versatile, sometimes linear (Anne Hathaway is accompanied beautifully by solo cello), sometimes richly contrapuntal, always well-heard. Green (pictured above) understands the needs of a solo voice over a ninety-minute span. But he could hardly function with a performer less talented than Amanda Forbes, less gifted with a vocal range from chest crooning to high soprano, or with a stage presence to match. Her performance was unforgettable.She was skilfully directed by Ed Madden, everything well paced and well integrated with the music. We could have done with surtitles – these are rich texts that deserve detailed hearing: or at the very least some labelling of the wives. I had read the texts beforehand, but still had to listen hard to identify every case. And I suppose it’s all a bit too long and, at the end, lingering. Mrs Beast and Demeter tape-looped reminded me of Birtwistle’s Orpheus; hauntingly beautiful, but perhaps too much by 10 minutes or so.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/worlds-wife-wales-millennium-centre-weston-studio-review-power-and-frustration-behind-throne,5
80,"Lucy Worsley's Nights at the Opera, BBC Two review - there's anti-elitism, and there's infantilism",Lucy Worsley's Nights at the Opera,BBC Two,2017-10-15,Jasper Rees,"The first thing to say about Lucy Worsley’s Nights at the Opera (BBC Two) is that it is laser-aimed at those who have not enjoyed many nights at the opera. Enjoyed in the sense of attended; also, probably, in the sense of enjoyed. Anyone who is a regular at the Garden, or keeps a plaid rug permanently pegged out by the Glyndebourne ha-ha, or is a life member of the Netrebko claque, approach if you dare, but with smelling salts to hand.Television occasionally feels it must demystify opera for the masses who subsidise it, strip away that elitist veneer and lay bare an elemental core. Harry Enfield did one such series for Channel 4. No doubt there’ll be more.Worsley was the obvious presenter for this gig, having demonstrated on her TV CV a yen for prancing around grand houses, a talent for crunching history into tabloid bites, and an incurable mania for dressing up. As usual she comes at things proprietorially. Her argument here is that the great operas grew out of the fertile soil of the society around them. The four works submitted for exegesis (“my operas”) were The Coronation of Poppea (which, she said, is all about sex), The Marriage of Figaro (class), Fidelio (politics) and Nabucco (national identity).She began, as any introduction to opera contractually must, with Pavarotti whopping out that football song. The travel budget took her to Venice, Vienna and Milan. Italophile snobs (guilty) had to suffer the consequences of her decision to bypass a session with the possibly chimerical BBC Pronunciation Unit: thus Montiverdi, incoggniti (though she got that one right the second time).Worsley's unblushing commitment to total immersion found her duetting with Danielle de Niese – “Ooh that was sexy,” she purred, as if star-rating her own contribution – and singing along, with flagrant disregard for tuning, with a couple of Mozart nerds on a Viennese street. A Viennese cake with a map for icing was co-opted to explain European geopolitics and the strata of Hapsburg society. To unpack the plots, she dived into either the dressing-up box or the toy box. She got herself up as all the main players in Figaro for a split-screen sequence which yielded the indelible sight of Worsley blowing kisses at herself, perhaps even ironically. The characters of Beethoven and Verdi’s operas were presented as cardboard figurines. “Here is Nabucco himself, wearing rather a fetching apron. He’s a baddie.” Napoleon’s adventures across Europe were similarly explained with toy cavaliers manoeuvred around a map by Worsley accessing, without much difficulty, her inner tot. This mode of presentation is cheap, and it’s cheerful. But however much perfectly good sense is smuggled in among the fun and games, there comes a point when a surfeit of infantilisation mocks the intelligence of even Worsley’s most purblind fanbase. Antonio Pappano’s exegesis of key musical moments, which he seemed not to have prepared very far in advance, poshed things up a bit, but didn’t quite belong in the same programme. He was particularly passionate about Nabucco’s final plea for forgiveness. “Of course it take a great performer to pull this off,” he added. Happily there was a clip of Placido Domingo doing just that, though no caption to tell viewers who he was.The most moving moment was reserved for the finale when a chorus of Italian singers, now retired to an old people’s home in Milan, sang “Va pensiero” and intoxicating music was blessedly able to speak for itself.

81,"Osud/Trouble in Tahiti, Opera North - swings and roundabouts in a surprising double-bill",Osud/Trouble in Tahiti,Opera North,2017-10-12,David Nice,"It was a topsy-turvy evening. Sometimes the things you expect to turn out best disappoint, while in this case the relatively small beer yielded a true ""Little Great"" of a production and the best singing in Opera North's latest double bill (subject to reshuffling during the rest of the run). Janáček's Osud (Destiny) should have packed the emotional punch of the night – a score authentically vivid in every bar tied to an experimental plot and a libretto sometimes pretentious in its observations on art and life; Bernstein's Trouble in Tahiti has more trouble finding its heart. But conviction, firm direction and a strong cast can make all the difference.Both operas – Osud (★★★) is hardly ""Little"", running at almost the length of Janáček's last four operatic masterpieces – have a dysfunctional couple at their heart, with an only child doomed to a troubled future; in this fascinating series, it would be interesting to see what other connections might be forged – the unhappy Czech pair yoked, perhaps, to Gilbert and Sullivan's bickering Angelina and Plaintiff? Both composers in last night's pairing place the main trouble in novel contexts. Janáček's protagonist-composer Živný works on an opera which begins by punishing the woman separated from him who's given birth to their illegitimate child and searches for an end after their reconciliation followed by her untimely and bizarre death. Can the puzzle pieces finally fit together?They did so with overwhelming emotion in one of the late, great Philip Langridge's searing characteisation in David Pountney's fertile, twice-seen production at English National Opera. John Graham Hall (pictured above with members of the Opera North chorus) is a lesser mortal (who isn't?), struggling with the upper-register anguish and catharsis; his acting is relatively limited, too. The central act – shame about the long curtain-down pauses between what in effect are quite short scenes – was painful to watch in the wrong sense. Difficult to bring off this Strindbergian hell, complete with mad mother – the heroine Míla's, too wild in intonation from Rosalind Plowright) – and director Annabel Arden didn't seem to be giving her singers enough help.At least there was dependable truth from Giselle Allen, in plausible decline from the red-headed beauty of the first act (pictured below with Graham-Hall). Here ""Little Greats"" designer Charles Edwards's schoolroom, full of young pioneers and reminders of a happier musical past in portraits of Dvořák and Smetana, gives way to the sunlight of Luhačovice Spa – still magically cradled by wooded hills in Janáček's native Moravia – where Mila and Živný meet again after their first parting.There's a clever symmetry with the post-war drabness of the older Živný's beleaguered existence, and the Opera North chorus are much the best thing about the show, plus a promising cameo from young baritone Christopher Nairne in the final scene. Martin André conducts an orchestra which makes some lovely sounds but doesn't have the dash and intensity which need to be there from the carousel swing of the opening through to the blinding conclusion. Maybe the whole thing needed more rehearsal time than it got as one of the six ""Little Greats""?Young director Matthew Eberhardt had an easier task with the six-hander of Bernstein's acrid 1950s bagatelle of marital disharmony (★★★★★) – and the benefit of choreographer Tim Claydon, who got some nifty moves from the jazz trio which punctuates the action with its ironic radio-studio choruses praising suburban bliss. Superb work here from Fflur Wyn, Joseph Shovelton and Nicholas Butterfield, keeping it deliciously deadpan until the central dance number and resisting the urge to mug. Tobias Ringborg's razor-sharp handling of the American vernacular idiom is a joy from the off, too.The icing on the cake is the vocally flawless performance of mezzo Wallace Giunta as a fashion-plate fifties housewife who has no facade to crack – these two are at it over the breakfast table. The decision to do without mikes and surtitles makes her 11-o-clock number about the fantasy world of the silver screen – the movie Trouble in Tahiti of the title – means not all the words are clear over the roistering orchestra, but diction is as good as it can be.Quirijn de Lang (pictured above with Giunta), a baritone with a highly distinctive, youthful voice, gets a less good number as the champion of the gym. But the peculiar heart of the piece, running from Dinah's dream of ""a quiet place"" away from the dust and ashes of her life through to  a rather fine duet of longing, husband and wife lost in their private thoughts, is finely handled by all – and Bernstein certainly doesn't let his usual sentimentality take over. Dated? Perhaps. But just enjoy the top-notch presentation of it all, enriched again by Edwards' clever designs, and be glad of the chance to catch this oddball drama before the Bernstein centenary celebrations come pouring forth next year.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/osudtrouble-tahiti-opera-north-swings-and-roundabouts-surprising-double-bill,
82,"Hansel and Gretel, Pop-Up Opera review - salty-sweet production takes wry pleasure in classic fairytale",Hansel and Gretel,Pop,2017-10-11,alexandra Coghlan,"They’ve done it in a boat and a barn, a former poorhouse and even a tunnel shaft, and now Pop-Up Opera bring their latest production to a museum. Bethnal Green’s 19th-century Museum of Childhood provides an evocative frame for Engelbert Humperdinck’s Hansel and Gretel, its glass display cases and carefully glossed and labelled toys setting the tone for a production that takes a wry, curatorial approach to its material.This knowing, arch quality to the drama comes almost entirely from Harry Percival’s surtitles, or “captions” as they are more accurately termed in the programme. Freely paraphrased or summarised, and overloaded with insistently up-to-the-minute slang and cultural references (Brexit, Strictly, McDonalds) they are determined to pull the rug from under every moment of onstage sincerity. Their look-at-me, larky humour soon begins to chafe against the passionate conviction and commitment of James Hurley’s young cast, whose actions need no ironic commentary to be thoroughly engrossing.Gurning and grinning, greedily munching down the Witch’s sweets and play-fighting with Gretel, Polly Leech’s Hansel (pictured below with Sofia Larsson a Gretel) is a joyous thing indeed, an Octavian in the making. Endlessly game and completely at ease, Leech is a natural clown and a wonderfully warm presence, whose lovely even mezzo already opens out at the top into something really exciting. It’s Leech that anchors the brother-sister partnership, a dynamic foil to Sofia Larsson’s quieter, sweeter Gretel, whose music comes in and out of focus in this tricky space.Hurley’s efficient contemporary production relies on its children to imagine us into Humperdinck’s fairy-tale fantasy. A fridge, assorted mops and buckets and some cardboard boxes offer an unpromising set of tools, but the cast conjure plenty of magic from them: mops become broomsticks or trees in the dark forest, strips of cardboard a songbird.The arrival of a splendid gingerbread house in Act Three - delivered courtesy of “Due Fairy” (groan) Rebecca Moon - ups the ante just when the action needs it, and Ailsa Mainwaring fills it with character as a pinny-clad Witch. Both she and Father (James Harrison) tread a careful line between near-tragedy (there’s an almost Wozzeck­-like edge to their domestic scene, powerfully sung) and broad comedy, giving the tale the dangerous edge it needs if it’s not to get too cutesy-kitsch.The vast, double-height atrium of the museum (built originally to house displays from the Great Exhibition of 1851) makes for a generous, if slightly boomy, acoustic – miraculous for the cuckoo calls and echoes of the forest, which trill magically from the gallery high above, but less ideal for the balance between resonant grand piano and singers.

More likely the thinking was that it fitted well enough into their Russian Revolution celebration, in view of its Russian source (Dostoyevsky) and setting (a Siberian prison camp), though one might have hoped that, among this bevy of autumn revivals (Khovanshchina and Eugene Onegin are both also old productions) some room - and funding - might have been found for an actual post-Revolution opera, as broadly defined as might be necessary.David Pountney’s production of Janáček’s last opera is now thirty-five years old, and it shows its age. The late Maria Björnson’s single complicated set (the work is done in one act with minimal breaks) was brilliantly conceived in 1982 as an engine for what is essentially an ensemble piece played out in an inherently confined space, but it imposes a certain style of realistic stage action that now looks dated and, however expertly stage managed (by Caroline Clegg), frankly a bit wooden. The composer’s curious dramaturgy, in which plot boils down to a series of prisoners’ stories about the crimes that brought them here in the first place, seems to need more space, more depth of movement, perhaps less furniture. I had an odd sense, throughout this performance, of being in some kind of production museum, like the one Elijah Moshinsky deliberately created when he staged Cavalleria rusticana in forties style for WNO’s fiftieth anniversary. And the play-within-a-play, the prisoners’ Easter treat, creaks as such things tend to do when they neither contribute to the plot nor raise much of a laugh in their own right.Having moaned my moan, I can compensate (I hope) by praising the musical side of things, which is if anything stronger than I remember it from all those years ago. Janáček may have thrown himself on our mercy with a questionable scenario, but musically he attacked the subject with a daredevilry that makes this score a masterclass in how to break every known rule of texture, harmony and orchestral balance while maintaining a clear mental image of what kind of music might express the horror and disrupted emotion of brutal incarceration with no hope of release.How could he get away with those dangerous combinations of brass and reduced strings, those weird, thin spacings of high and low with nothing in the middle, those poisonous chordings that constantly question the truth of the loving thoughts that keep floating in on the melody? He never heard the work played, yet he captured in precise sounds the ongoing, unremitting agony of these men: criminals, yes (the tales are tales of murder), but creatures of passion and regret, objects of loathing and pity. Tomáš Hanus, himself Czech and conducting from John Tyrrell’s cleaned-up new edition, obviously has an instinctive grasp of these parameters, and directs a powerful, uninhibited reading that makes no attempt to sand down the rough edges or soften the aural blows, and the orchestra’s playing is quite simply superb.The cast has no apparent weakness that can’t, in the end, be put down to something inherent in the work or the production. Simon Bailey sustains Shishkov’s rambling Act 3 narrative well without perhaps quite catching all its grotesquerie; Mark Le Brocq (pictured above) hurls out Luka’s account of his vicious murder of a prison officer with a ferocity that profits (even in Pountney’s English translation) from the psychological precision of Janáček’s word-setting. And there are fine vignettes from Alan Oke as Skuratov, who shot his lover’s bridegroom at their wedding, from Paula Greenwood as the boy Alyeya (whose crime we never learn), from Adrian Thompson as Shapkin, whose ears were almost pulled off by a magistrate, and from several others too numerous to list.The chorus, a compendium of solo and ensemble, all male, are at their usual high level. But the lame eagle of the old production has been pensioned off in favour of a back projection and what looks like a mechanical chicken in a cage. As usual, machines destroying jobs. Or is it health and safety and animal rights, Siberian style?",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/house-dead-welsh-national-opera-review-elderly-staging-music-comes-fresh,4
84,"Opera: Passion, Power and Politics, V&A review - seven cities, seven masterpieces",Opera: Passion,Power and Politics,2017-10-07,David Nice,"There's something here for everyone, as a ""roll up!"" slogan for one of the greatest shows in town might put it. Even opera buffs don't seem to have found much to fault with the cornucopia of sounds, moving pictures, objects, paintings, drawings and even a working stage set handsomely displayed in the spacious areas beneath the Victoria & Albert's gleaming new Exhibition Road entrance.Discrimination proves key. ""Operas and cities"" is the brief, which could have sprawled or resulted in some inapposite choices, but what we have is impeccable. In the first two ""theatres"", it looks as if there might be more from the V&A's enormous collections to show the beauty of craftsmanship in each of the chosen ages than direct source material about the operas in question: those glass vessels and instruments from Venice around the time Monteverdi's The Coronation of Poppea was premiered in 1642, the Hogarth image of a coffee house and a fan of 1787 with a plan of the Haymarket Theatre Royal's auditorium for Handel's Rinaldo in London. But already we're impressed with original manuscripts, and the first big theatrical payoff is a period-style working model with painted flats, scenery raised and lowered, rolling waves and mermaids frolicking between them. Gorgeous.The music on your Bowers & Wilkins headphones – not a plug, it's just that this company is the best, and I wouldn't exchange my B&W speakers for anything – is perfectly synchronised, automatically picking up on each zone it's supposed to represent, though move from one area to another and you lose your chosen track. Best is how you can read a composer's autograph score listening to the music at the same time, and for me the real wonders began with Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro and Vienna 1786. Twice in the course of the exhibition – there's no overkill – that master conductor and verbal interpreter, too, Antonio Pappano, takes you through an operatic number, starting here with Cherubino's ""Non so piu, cosa son"", after which Bartoli's performance takes over. And there it is, in Mozart's very own hand.There are very precious loans here from Vienna, Salzburg – the last, unfinished portrait of Mozart by Langer – and Prague (wonder of wonders, the 1787 piano on which the master played while he was in the city for the success of the Don Giovanni premiere). Milan's libraries and Scala Theatre Museum have loaned wonders for the 1842 Nabucco room, too, though the set-piece here is a contemporary work, Matthias Schaller's Fratelli d'Italia, photographs assembled between 2005 and this year of 150 19th century Italian opera house auditoriums comprising one big, theatrical whole (pictured below).Some might find fault with Wagner being linked to Paris (the 1860 version of Tannhäuser) rather than Bayreuth, but the fourth space usefully kills two operatic birds with one stone, featuring among other artistic treasures Degas's depiction of the pit and stage in the notorious zombie-nuns ballet from Meyerbeer's Robert le Diable; I've seen it, tucked away upstairs in the V&A's rather odd picture collection, but I wonder if many folk have got that far (the Theatre Museum is nearby, a gem within a giant).It's clever of the curators to have assembled different films of how the Venusberg ballet has been handled in recent decades – I rather liked the look of former Royal Opera chief and advisor on the exhibition Kasper Holten's version – though even more spectacular, if less creative, is the giant screen next door depicting the bloodiest depiction of Salome's final scene with John the Baptist's head in Strauss's epoch-making 1905 opera, David McVicar's for Covent Garden (he and the Royal Opera get the other big look-in, the Sextet from Figaro – visually striking performances both).This Salome/Dresden room excels on the artistic front, with mostly Austro-German – and male – depictions of female sexuality, outstandingly so Kirchner's and Schmidt-Rotluff's woodcuts and lithographs. Here, too, is the manuscript score for Salome's repulsive head-kissing, and a nice touch in a recreation of the oriental rug-covered couch in Freud's study for folk to sit on and watch the film.Sound and vision go crazy for Shostakovich's Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk – Leningrad 1934, with bright red hangovers from the 1917 revolution. I'd not seen the film of the very young-looking composer rattling off the galop of the shabby peasant from the opera: stunning, and nicely offset by a recreation of his study in the foreground. Again, loans from Russian museums enrich the context; an excellent choice of another gem by Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin to follow the revelatory room in the Royal Academy's Revolution exhibition provides a perfect, if unintended, parallel with the bored provincial housewife of the opera and the novella on which it's based.As grand finale, there's an assemblage of all-too-short clips from 20th and 21st operas since, starting with Gershwin's Porgy and Bess and ending with the wildly overrated if visually striking success of Benjamin's Written on Skin. You might be misled from the short clip into thinking that Glass's Einstein on the Beach is bearable for the entire stretch; for me, it's not. Too much going on here, too many different scenes at once, but as a taster it's a good start. And that should send visitors out anxious to see and hear more: one aim of the exhibition, among many, very well done. What a tragedy that Martin Roth, director of the V&A at the time the project was launched, is no longer with us to see it.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera-visual-arts/opera-passion-power-and-politics-va-review-seven-cities-seven-masterpieces,5
85,"Dardanus, English Touring Opera review - mixed fortunes for warzone updating",Dardanus,English Touring Opera,2017-10-07,Gavin Dixon,"Baroque opera is always a challenge to stage, and Rameau’s Dardanus is no exception. In its original form, the story, of love in times of war, was infused with allegorical characters and mythological scenes. It flopped, and so Rameau and a new librettist thoroughly revised the work to focus more on the human drama. But even with the changes, the plot is still slow and nebulous, and ends about half an hour before the opera does. Fortunately, Rameau’s music is continually engaging, a kaleidoscope of moods and colours that more than justifies its lengthy duration.The story tells of Iphise (Galina Averina, pictured left), the daughter of Phrygian King Teucer (Grant Doyle) who is betrothed to his retainer Anténor (Timothy Nelson), but in love with her father’s foe, Prince Dardanus (Anthony Gregory). Offstage battles dictate the course of their love, and each has recourse to a soothsayer, Isménor (Frederick Long), before Dardanus ends up imprisoned by Teucer, eventually to be freed by a repentant Anténor and reunited with Iphise. Venus (Eleanor Penfold) makes an appearance at the end to bless the union, a vestige of the more allegory-laden first version of the opera.Venus and the soothsayer notwithstanding, the libretto fits well into the modern-day setting of Douglas Rintoul’s production. The single set (designer Cordelia Chisholm) is a concrete bunker in an unnamed warzone: the desert fatigues and copious sand suggest the Middle East, but we’re not told. The various settings are distinguished with modest lighting effects (lighting designer Mark Howland), and offstage gun battles are similarly evoked through flashing lights across the back of the set.The cast is led from the top by the leading couple, Galina Averina and Anthony Gregory. Averina has a focused soprano tone, impressive clarity in all registers, and beautifully nimble ornaments, although her vibrato might irk Rameau purists. They are unlikely to complain, though, about Gregory, who has a light, conversational delivery, intimate but suitably dramatic. The title role is the most dramatically varied of the opera, and Gregory gives a convincing and emotionally sophisticated portrayal. The supporting roles are less secure. Timothy Nelson, as Anténor, struggles with the upper register, where he has recurring tuning problems. Grant Doyle looks the part of the overbearing king, but much of the music lies too low for his voice. Stronger support, though from Alessandro Fisher in the small role of Arcas (and no-doubt secure too as understudy to Gregory) and Eleanor Penfold as Venus (pictured below), she and the supporting cast making a convincing case for the modest stagecraft during the instrumental chaconne that ends the opera.Conductor Jonathan Williams leads a lively and lucid account of Rameau’s diverse score. His tempos are never rushed, but the rhythmic intensity, especially in the many dance numbers, propels the music. He also brings impressive coherence to each of the acts by deftly weaving together the often contrasting successive numbers. Period-instrument accompaniment is provided by The Old Street Band. Their tone is bold and forthright, painting Ramaeu’s textures in clean primary colours. The orchestral balance is string-heavy, but with the woodwinds occasionally coming to the fore, the oboes energising the dances, and the flutes and bassoons giving a ghostly resonance to the mournful arias of the prison act. This is a serviceable production, and a welcome introduction to the UK stage for the revised version of Rameau’s opera, but the music is definitely the main draw here.  @saquabote",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/dardanus-english-touring-opera-review-mixed-fortunes-warzone-updating,3
86,"Khovanshchina/Eugene Onegin, Welsh National Opera review - Russian revivals strong and weak",Khovanshchina/Eugene Onegin,Welsh National Opera,2017-10-02,stephen Walsh,"About Khovanshchina I once had serious doubts. Leaving aside its unfinished condition, it always struck me as what Wagnerians would call a bleeding chunk of history, unstructured, confused, over-researched and dramaturgically obscure. Three recent performances in Shostakovich’s powerful performing edition of Mussorgsky's incomplete original have completely changed my mind: Graham Vick’s incomparable “promenade” production in the People’s Tent at Edgbaston three years ago, Semyon Bychkov’s Proms performance this summer, and now this revival of David Pountney’s at that time still problematic 2007 staging by Welsh National Opera. Nothing will ever knock the rough edges off Mussorgsky’s score, conceived in the shadow of the censors’ rejection of Boris Godunov and composed in a state of gradually advancing alcoholism. The piece is quite simply a triumph of operatic genius and musical originality over the normal Aristotelian requirements of well-made, coherent and properly motivated theatre.In Pountney’s production, this rambling account of the factional in-fighting at the time of Peter the Great’s accession in late 17th century Moscow is not exactly clarified for the humble opera-goer. It relocates the action to just post-Revolutionary Russia, with red-uniformed streltsy (Ivan the Terrible’s original guards regiment, now under the private command of the ruffianly Prince Ivan Khovansky), Peter’s poteshny guards as shiny-raincoated Cheka officers, and a single basic constructivist set (a marvellous if somewhat cluttered design by the late, much-lamented Johan Engels) that might grace any exhibition of early Soviet art. It even adds one or two minor obscurities of its own. But the sheer musical power of the performance under Tomáš Hanus, in combination with Pountney’s superb, musicianly stagecraft, reduces these problems to something close to insignificance.Anyone who knows Boris Godunov knows about Mussorgsky’s intuitive feel for the theatre: his unequalled brilliance in the characterisation of crowds and individuals, the almost cinematic vividness and precision of his musical stage management. Khovanshchina is no less thrilling in these respects, and it would be hard to imagine a better unit for their display than the WNO chorus. Every time they rush, march, drift or leak on to the stage, as guards, Old Believers, migrant workers, or what-have-you, a shiver runs down the spine. The impact of their singing and acting is, in my experience, pretty well unrivalled; and it should be noted that not only are they singing this big choral opera in Russian, but it is one of three major works they have had in more or less simultaneous rehearsal with big choral or chorus-solo parts: Tchaikovsky’s Eugene Onegin also in Russian (see below), and Janáček’s From the House of the Dead (in English, opening next Sunday). The Land of Song is a good old Welsh cliché; but in the Welsh opera chorus it long ago became reality, and it has stayed that way.But this Khovanshchina is strongly cast also in the solo parts, without obvious exception. The long first act is essentially a wide-screen epic affair (though with important solos, notably Adrian Thompson’s shifty, cowardly yet oddly likeable Scribe, very stylishly sung). But the second act is pure individual confrontation, a terrific operatic row between three of Mussorgsky’s main characters: the devious, modernising Prince Golitsyn (Mark Le Brocq), Khovansky himself (Robert Hayward, pictured above), and the prince-turned-Old-Believer Dosifei (Miklós Sebestyén). It would be good to have space for a detailed discussion of this riveting scene, done here with only minimal cuts, and an epitome of Mussorgsky’s technique of individual psychological portraiture; but alas I have to limit myself to praising the sustained intensity of the performance of these three singers, here and (apart from Golitsyn, who never reappears) elsewhere. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/khovanshchinaeugene-onegin-welsh-national-opera-review-russian-revivals-strong-and-weak,4
87,"Cavalleria Rusticana/Trial by Jury, Opera North review - sombre triumph and pale froth",Cavalleria Rusticana/Trial by Jury,Opera North,2017-09-28,graham Rickson,"Pairing Mascagni’s Cavalleria Rusticana with Gilbert and Sullivan’s Trial by Jury makes for a pleasingly schizoid evening in the latest of Opera North's The Little Greats series. Mascagni’s crashing final chords precede a longish interval, and when you re-enter the auditorium it’s not just the set that’s changed, but much of the audience. Karolina Sofulak’s Mascagni production is a sombre triumph, relocating the action from Sicily to a similarly repressed 1980s Poland.Instead of Mediterranean sunshine we get harsh strip lighting and peeling wallpaper: Lucia’s village shop is a distinctly bare affair dominated by a large set of scales and lots of empty shelving. There’s the occasional consignment of sausage or bread, but the obedient queues are usually leapfrogged by the pushier male villagers, presumably waving party membership cards. The sense of confinement, of petty frustration, is tangible.What’s more remarkable is how Sofulak’s cast physically inhabits the stage: Rosalind Plowright’s Lucia stands scornfully behind her counter, her clientele an anonymous grey gaggle, all drooping shoulders and headscarves. Some of the thrills come from the contrast between what the crowd looks like and how they actually sing: this company’s outstanding chorus have rarely sounded better. The bigger roles are superbly cast: Giselle Allen’s commanding Santuzza is initially a grey, peripheral figure, physically changing as her rage and frustration develop. Turiddù is a shifty Jonathan Stoughton (pictured below with Allen and Plowright), his vocal beauty ill befitting such a character.This is a brilliantly constructed, concise opera: you’re struck by how little singing there is at so many points. Characters here stare, brood and scowl. The Easter Hymn sounds sumptuous, a necessary interlude before the bloody denouement. Katie Bray’s Lola is a fragile, ephemeral presence, and the cuckolded Alfio’s beloved taxi is a vintage Fiat, retro-fitted to look like a Trabant. Marvellous, then, with some glorious playing from Tobias Ringborg’s orchestra – harpist Celine Saout deserves a shout out.John Savournin’s Trial by Jury has some similarly bold ideas, but can’t help feeling like pale froth by comparison. Updating the action to the 1930s and presenting Angelina as a wronged MGM starlet works nicely, allowing Savournin to insert a brilliantly choreographed prologue with Amy J Payne’s journalist introducing the scenario as a Pathé newsreel. Angelina’s bridesmaids look like 1920s flappers, and there’s a superb jury. Sullivan’s score is most entertaining when he’s sending up stodgy 19th century oratorio, and it’s striking to hear how technically accomplished this one-act piece is. Nicholas Watt’s silver-tongued Edwin is a joy, jumping on tables whilst playing the violin. He’s matched by Jeremy Peaker’s Learned Judge, able to toss a straw boater across the stage with the ease of a professional Frisbee thrower. Amy Freston sparkles and shimmies as Angelina (pictured below with Jeremy Peaker), her light, clear voice utterly right for the role.Yet everything feels a little bit too busy, too frenzied. It’s difficult to hear many of Gilbert’s wittier couplets, and there’s so much happening on stage at certain points that it becomes exhausting to watch. This short divertissement would work better in a room above a pub, with a small cast and a piano accompaniment. Still, Oliver Rundell conjures bright, fizzing colours from the Orchestra of Opera North, and Charles Edwards’ ingenious, constantly shifting set is a source of pleasure. But I can’t imagine I’ll remember much about this production in six months’ time, whereas Sofulak’s Mascagni will prove difficult to forget.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/cavalleria-rusticanatrial-jury-opera-north-review-sombre-triumph-and-pale-froth,4
88,"Oedipe, LPO, Jurowski, RFH review - Enescu's masterpiece glorious and complete",Oedipe,LPO,2017-09-25,David Nice,"It’s official: Romanian master George Enescu’s four-act Greek epic lives and breathes as a work of transcendent genius. It took last year’s Royal Opera production to lead us further along the path established by the magnificent EMI studio recording with José van Dam as protagonist. But La Fura dels Baus’s brave and sometimes disorienting vision was incomplete, shorn of some bewitching dance-music, and fine young conductor Leo Hussain couldn’t hope to reach the total understanding and mastery of a unique style – or styles – that only Vladimir Jurowski could achieve with his musical partner of a decade’s standing, the London Philharmonic Orchestra.Their towering concert version, first performed in Bucharest and here dramatized by glorious lighting of the Festival Hall organ from Chahine Yevroyan, had one casualty along the way – its original Oedipus, a colossal role Enescu once envisaged for Chaliapin (too old to sing it when the work was finally completed in 1931). Teddy Tahu Rhodes's replacement, French bass-baritone Paul Gay, certainly has the stamina, and took us from perplexity and bleakness – those quarter-tones when Oedipus arrives at the Gate of Thebes appropriately strange – though breakdown of regal control to the very emotional catharsis at Colonus. The range, though, is extreme, and Gay doesn’t quite have what it takes at the very top and bottom of the range. There were a couple of more impressive male voices here, namely those of In Sung Sim, reprising the role of Phorbas he sang at the Royal Opera, and Boris Pinkhasovich as Theseus. Not a bad actor, Gay also needs the last inch of charisma. Is this a role for Gerald Finley, if there are ever the resources to mount the work again?French poet Edmond Fleg’s beautiful libretto for Enescu - never too flowery and so often simply, devastatingly human, as when the blind Oedipus describes daughter Antigone as “light of my eyes” – takes us from the cradle to the grave, or wherever it is Oedipus goes in his final apotheosis. The malign wonderland of the second act gives opportunities for Enescu to work atmospheric magic on the pre-storm oppressiveness at the wooded valley where three roads meet, the ominous sleep of the Sphinx and the majestic terror of her awakening. Justly cited as an example of Enescu’s instrumental wizardry, the riddle scene was appropriately climactic last night, with iconic Hungarian mezzo Ildikó Komlósi amplified and aloft in one of the Festival Hall boxes, musical saw player beside her.Yet everything is, on its own terms, at the same level of invention. Act One, beginning with the short-lived optimism of Theban celebrations for the birth of Jocasta’s and Laius’s son, ripples at first with a French freedom of movement and limpidity of scoring – an individual nod to the example of Ravel’s Daphnis and Chloe rather than Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring. And how could we have been deprived of the dances at Covent Garden, so exquisitely led here by recent LPO arrival Juliette Bausor’s mystic flute? The doom already established by the evocative low instruments in the Prelude returned in the effortless Tiresias of Willard White, one of many assumptions from veteran singers (Felicity Palmer, as Oedipus's adoptive mother Merope, pictured above with Gay, still sounds as distinctive as she always did). In some cases, though, you wondered why younger singers hadn't been given a look-in.That heart of darkness’s black mass comes, of course, in the “Oedipus Tyrannos” act, parallel to Stravinsky’s single action of 1927 but so different in the way Enescu shapes the tension and rings so many changes on the massive sound now centre-stage. Ruxandra Donose brought much-needed lustre in Jocasta's slinkier solos alongside gorgeous orchestral colours. And then the redemption of “Oedipus at Colonus”, anticipated by the three melting “I shall follow you”s of Gabriela Iştoc’s lovely Antigone. This last act is the most wonderful thing about the score, a pastoral with a dark intermezzo shaped by the arrival and dismissal of Creon (Christopher Purves) and a massive metamorphosis as Oedipus vanishes in the Athenian cave, having proved what he told the Sphinx, that Man is more powerful than Destiny.Jurowski had the measure of every mood, conducting with his usual clarity and supple authority, no doubt bringing his experience of another supremely complex and fantastical operatic score, Strauss's Die Frau ohne Schatten, to bear; how easy it was to take for granted the orchestral miracles he conjured. If the Choir of the George Enescu Philharmonic came and went in levels of intensity – disappointing in the welcome to Thebes, fired up again during the peripeteia – the LPO never ceased to project extreme beauty and extreme violence. It’s the highest compliment to all that one came out thinking not so much “what a magnificent performance” as “what a great masterpiece”.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/oedipe-lpo-jurowski-rfh-review-enescus-masterpiece-glorious-and-complete,4
89,"Senza Sangue/Bluebeard's Castle, Hackney Empire - uneven French-Hungarian mix",Senza Sangue/Bluebeard's Castle,Hackney Empire,2017-09-20,David Nice,"Has Hackney ever seen or heard such a spectacle – a full Hungarian orchestra taking up most of the Empire stalls to complete the semi-circle of a relatively empty stage? And did enough of London get to hear about it? I certainly wouldn’t have done had it not been for a chance conversation with Péter Eötvös, a leading figure in Hungary’s beleaguered but still thriving cultural life, in an interval of the Budapest Ring. You don’t often get to witness a major composer conduct his own response to a masterpiece – Senza Sangue, a psychological two-hander fit with Bartók’s Bluebeard’s Castle – so what a shame it had to be for one night only.Not that the spectacle or the casting were perfect by any means in this joint venture between the Armel Opera Festival, l'Opéra Grand Avignon and l'Opéra-Théâtre de Metz Métropole. We had to wait for the Bartók to hear two voices able to match the uncovered glory of the Pannon Philharmonic, resident orchestra in Hungary’s beautiful city of Pecs, or for that matter two singers who were right for their demanding roles. Senza Sangue (Bloodless) is a rather stilted-sounding adaptation by Eötvös' wife Mari Mezei, in Italian as the title suggests, of a novel by Alessandro Baricco. A woman who was a girl when her father was shot dead by three men meets – or tracks down – the last of them alive. He’s 72, she must be in her early fifties. So why cast two young and inexperienced-sounding – in other words lesser music-college level - French singers, Albane Carrère and Romain Bockler (pictured below)? For ironic effect?I thought so at first. But there is no irony, no humour, in the situation, its possible naturalism defused by director Róbert Alföldi’s unnatural, jerky movements for his puppet-singers (and why slide the three pieces of furniture, a table and two chairs, up and down the stage?) And if the denouement was supposed to show the unrelenting hold of the past on damaged psyches, it came across as surprisingly weak.With voices as under-supported, and characterisations as uncertain, as this, interest remained with the orchestra. Eötvös excels at high and low timbres, and some of his ideas – the writhing for two clarinets, the string unisons which share something in common with Bartók – really stick. It’s understandable, when the dramatic premise is understood very early on, that the score should be mostly thick and angsty – Bluebeard’s Castle is a thriller that moves in the opposite direction – but less would often be more, and it is when the lines finally settle down, but actually increase the tension, shortly before the end. I’d like to see Senza Sangue again, with a more mature, richer-sounding double act.There’s no shame in playing second fiddle to Bartók's towering masterpiece: even Schoenberg’s Erwartung did that in a Royal Opera double-bill, and that was doubly unwelcome after rather than before the interval. The problem remains: can what’s behind the seven doors Judith insists on unlocking in the metaphorical castle of Bluebeard’s blighted life ever, visually, match the illustrative power of Bartók’s queasy music, where dissonant-chorded blood taints even the prettiest things? The second, and much better, director of the evening, Nadine Duffaut, kept it all closely related to the psychodrama of the man and the woman, producing some bafflements along the way: why the crouching man (narrator of the spoken Prologue Philippe Murgier) and the projected despair of the woman in the torture-chamber (fitfully striking video designs as well as sets, I presume, by Emmanuelle Favre, who sticks to the claustrophobic curved wall for both operas)? Why no blood-red until relatively late in the action, no blaze behind the fifth door to match the orchestra?Everything was much clearer in the one-to-ones of Adrienn Miksch’s sinuous, glinting-toned Judith and Bálint Szabó’s powerful yet vulnerable Bluebeard (pictured above) The psychodynamics whereby even as the woman gets closer to the man, her forcefulness weakens him until the point where both become the losers, were compellingly acted out. The evening’s most involving moment, both musically and dramatically, was the revelation of Bluebeard’s pool of tears – Szabó’s now-stricken Duke clutching the throne poignantly, turned away from his Judith – and its aftermath, Hungarian strings ardently and tragically flaming. The terrifying sounds of the climax did not disappoint, either. Not quite on the level of Iván Fischer's Budapest Festival Orchestra concert performance earlier this year, this was still distinguished work from Eötvös and his orchestra.One last enigma: why did Favre cling on to mythic garb for the regal pair and the Stepfordised former wives? And while you hoped that having a female director might ring the changes on Judith’s ultimate submissiveness, I guess what happens on stage is tied to the freezing of Bartók’s final pages. Perhaps a sequel where Judith finally emerges from the castle a strong woman rather than an abuse victim (Debussy's and Maeterlinck’s Mélisande) might work.  Eötvös would certainly be up to the challenge.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/senza-sanguebluebeards-castle-hackney-empire-uneven-french-hungarian-mix,3
90,"La Damnation de Faust, LSO, Rattle, Barbican review - infernal dynamite",La Damnation de Faust,LSO,2017-09-18,Peter Quantrill,"For his monster concerts in 1840s Paris, Berlioz took pride in assembling and marshalling a ""great beast of an orchestra"". At the Barbican on Sunday night, the LSO filled the stage and fitted the bill. Their thoroughbred tradition of Berlioz performance, long nurtured by the late Sir Colin Davis, looks set fair to be renewed by Sir Simon Rattle. Just as they had done last week in a remarkable survey of modern English music to open his tenure as music director, they gave him everything in La Damnation de Faust.Cramped acoustic be damned: there was playing here of unabashed violence, backed up by a contribution of thrilling exuberance from the London Symphony Chorus, who appeared to seize their moment like the prisoners in Fidelio, after years of being sidelined and overlooked by Valery Gergiev’s programming.Not that Rattle’s Berlioz is in hock to the memory of Davis. He turns the screw more tightly. The preludial material of Part 1 simply flew by, and the awkwardly pseudo-operatic construction of Part 2 was rounded and buffed and polished into shape where Sir John Eliot Gardiner, at his recent Prom, had relished the heterogenous character of this unclassifiable ""dramatic legend"". With his Faust got up as Berlioz and his Marguerite channelling the watery spirit of Ophelia, Gardiner presented an evening packed full of ideas; in as much as the piece ever will, this Faust made sense as the French translation of a German story, written on a hinge turning from Beethoven 9 to Tristan und Isolde.Replacing Gerald Finley at short notice, Christopher Purves made an urbane devil of the world, pitched somewhere between Alberich and Swiss Tony, score-bound for his Song of the Flea and Serenade but resonantly insinuating a power finally unleashed with Faust’s Damnation. The finest singing of the night came from Karen Cargill (pictured above with Bryan Hymel), embodying Marguerite not as a virginal ingénue but an eager lover. From the heartbeat pulse of her King of Thule ballad and the glowing core of her mezzo she drew a portrait of ardent distraction traced at every step by Alexander Nemtsov’s viola – and how lovely it was to hear in their last note a Wagnerian fusion of voice and instrument.From the profound solitude of Marguerite’s scene to open Part 4 came to mind a pitiful letter written a couple of years before Faust by Berlioz’s son Louis to his aunt, terrified by his father’s absence and his mother’s slide into alcoholic incapacity: ""Every day she waits for a letter which never comes."" Cargil made it into the still point around which the story turns, while preparing us for the work’s lyric climax in Faust’s great invocation of ""Nature immense"". This found Hymel in something approaching the heroic stature of his Enée for the Royal Opera’s Trojans after some pinched and strained moments earlier on.Cargill was not the only one visibly affected by the evening’s closing coup de théâtre, as rank upon rank of children from the Tiffin School gradually filled the floor of the stalls to play their part in Berlioz’s sublimely extended epilogue, which on this occasion was not a bar too long. I would gladly return for the repeat performance on Tuesday just to hear the last five minutes again.@PeterQuantrill ",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music-opera/la-damnation-de-faust-lso-rattle-barbican-review-infernal-dynamite,4
91,"Pagliacci/L’enfant et les sortilèges, Opera North review - off and on with the motley",Pagliacci/L’enfant et les sortilèges,Opera North,2017-09-18,Robert Beale,"The first two one-acters in Opera North’s season called The Little Greats were unveiled on Saturday. There are six in all, scheduled on a mix-and-match basis so Leeds opera-goers can choose their own tapas menu: grab one show, choose from various pairs, or even try three on a Saturday (including a matinee) if you want to.Leoncavallo’s Pagliacci and Ravel’s L’enfant et les sortilèges were both originally slated to be conducted by Aleksandar Markovic when he was the company’s music director. But the entire enterprise is the most thoroughgoing example yet of its ensemble philosophy, with principal singers in one production popping up in support roles in another and chorus members frequently stepping into the limelight. It seems only natural that Tobias Ringborg, already part of the season’s conducting team, has stepped up to the rostrum for Pagliacci while Martin André takes over L’Enfant.Set and lighting design for all six productions is by Charles Edwards, and there will be a front cloth at each performance showing the assembled team – directors, performers, chorus and all – in a group photograph. Edwards is also director of Pagliacci, and he has used the picture in his reinterpretation of the classic story of “strolling players”, picking up on the idea of the company in rehearsal. In this version the performers are themselves. Concept photos of the other operas in the series are visible on the walls of the rehearsal space, and the chorus are first heard sitting down rehearsing their notes. Props that will recur in other Little Greats shows (notably the grandfather clock for L’Enfant et les Sortilèges) are simply lying around.So it’s not so much “On with the motley” as off with it, most of the time – though Peter Auty, as Canio, gets to wear the clown’s face-paint and wig for the final run-through (pictured right). Nedda (Elin Pritchard) is having an affair with the conductor, Silvio (Phillip Rhodes).It all begins with Tonio (Richard Burkhard) giving the prologue, suitably adapted, in English (“You’ll see a company rehearsing an opera”), though the story itself is sung in Italian – until the famous final line, as Tonio reverts to English to shout that “The performance is over”.It all works remarkably well and is almost a motto piece for the entire series (though I hope this verismo does not extend to real stabbings behind the scenes in the Grand Theatre). Peter Auty plays Canio with focussed, obsessive intensity, his timbre equal to the demands of Leoncavallo’s fin-de-siècle lushness, though occasionally a little thin at the very top. Pritchard (pictured below with Auty) is a feisty lady and sings Nedda with beauty as well as conviction.Richard Burkhard, ever a pleasure to hear, makes a remarkable baddy (he earned panto-style boos at the end) precisely because he’s not a hunchback caricature, but someone you can believe in. Phillip Rhodes refrains from any digs at power-crazed maestri in his acting – if anything, he’s the straight guy here, just plain lustful – and balances his colleagues in vocal power. And Joseph Shovelton makes Beppe a contrasting cheeky-chappy cameo.Annabel Arden directs L’Enfant et les Sortilèges in a manner that, like her other best work for Opera North, is faithful to the score and the book but full of imaginative touches. Of course the Child (Wallis Giunta – an inspired piece of casting, pictured below being harassed by Arithmetic) has his hand-held electronic device to engage his attention at the outset, rather than listen to his Mother (Ann Taylor): what youngster today wouldn’t? A gifted cast round up the other roles – Fflur Wyn, Quirijn de Lang, Katie Bray, John Graham Hall, John Savournin, Lorna James, Kathryn Walker, Victoria Sharp, Rachel J Mosley and Ann Taylor herself – the sort of team only an ensemble enterprise of this kind could provide for Ravel’s 45-minute fantasy.It’s definitely on with the motley in the costume department (Hannah Clark the designer) as chairs, teapot, fire, wallpaper figures, cats, squirrel, storybook princess and the rest all come to life, following Colette’s delicious libretto. The story, with its hints at adolescent awakenings alongside dawning awareness of the need to help one’s fellow creatures as a child grows up, has been interpreted in deep and subtle ways before, but in Arden’s version it retains an innocence that’s wholly appropriate, and on the first night won much laughter from its post-interval audience.Musically it was enchanting to hear, the Orchestra of Opera North exchanging the gutsy passion they’d given Ringborg in Pagliacci for a gentler, more whimsical soundworld for L’Enfant under André. Together they made an auspicious beginning for a season that could be even better than the previous Little Greats festival back in 2004.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/pagliaccil%E2%80%99enfant-et-les-sortil%C3%A8ges-opera-north-review-and-motley,5
92,"Die Zauberflöte, Royal Opera review – enjoyable revival of much loved production",Die Zauberflöte,Royal Opera  – enjoyable revival of much loved production,2017-09-13,Bernard Hughes,"This is the sixth revival of David McVicar’s production of Die Zauberflöte at Covent Garden since its debut in 2003. It was heard most recently in 2015, and is modestly described in the Royal Opera’s own publicity as a “classic”. Having not seen it until now, I enjoyed the singing and was impressed with the set and lighting, but I found the staging in some ways neither fish nor fowl.Last year, Alexandra Coghlan for theartsdesk found Simon McBurney’s production at English National Opera to be “revelatory” in its inventive theatricality. Here McVicar, and revival director Thomas Guthrie, dip their toe in these waters with the giant puppet snake that starts the opera, and the masked animals dancing weirdly when Tamino plays the flute in Act One. But for the most part the staging is fairly traditional and perhaps a touch tame, when set against the ambition of the set design.The set is grandiose, all dark marble columns that loom in and out, with occasionally colourful backdrops: a bright yellow sun in the finale, a red sky behind Sarastro’s first entrance, a craggy blue for the Queen of the Night (a stern Sabine Devieilhe). The costumes are mostly muted colours, the lighting mostly low. But all this seems somehow at odds with the colourful exuberance of so much of the music, and the artless folk-like melodies that predominate.I would not be the first to observe that the story is the sheerest nonsense, cobbled together from disparate sources by the entrepreneur and original Papageno, Emanuel Schikaneder. The spoken dialogue (delivered here in German) is comic, but at times the audience, especially in the first half, seemed to be laughing rather dutifully. The second half provoked more spontaneous laughs, Roderick Williams as Papageno channelling his inner Stan Laurel. The slapstick, and attempts at audience interaction, are broad, but engaging and funny.The singing was (almost) uniformly excellent. For me the standout moments were the bass arias for Sarastro (Royal Opera debutant Mika Kares) in Act Two. In “O Isis und Osiris” in particular he was rich and resonant, a proper bass for a proper bass aria. Kares (pictured above) had a statuesque authority in the role that contrasted well with Williams’s foolish but well-meaning Papageno. I must praise the Three Boys, James Fernandes, Oliver Simpson and Jayden Tejuoso, whose singing was crystal clear and had evident enjoyment in their appearances.Devieilhe as the Queen of the Night (pictured below) gave a coldly furious “Der hölle Rache” that had sufficient wow factor, and made up for a slightly imprecise Act One aria. Mauro Peter, another Royal Opera debutant, had no difficulty filling the stage as Tamino. Siobhan Stagg’s Pamina was an assertive heroine, but also affecting in her Act Two misery, floating high notes with the utmost control.It was notable that the libretto’s more problematic sexist lines – “women do little and talk a lot” or “without a man, a woman cannot fulfil her destiny” – were greeted with laughter from the audience. There is no need to rail against these offences to modern sensibility: derision is a much more powerful response. And Mozart’s musical depiction of Pamina as a strong woman is likewise.The conductor Julia Jones maintained steady tempos and the orchestra were poised and controlled, never anything less than refined, but never pushing the boat out. The horns sounded terrific as did, fittingly, flautist Danuel Pailthorpe.This production is visually very striking and beautiful to look at. It was also good to listen to. But although I did enjoy it a great deal – and the evening did go past very quickly – in the end I was left wondering if there was quite enough magic in this Magic Flute.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/die-zauberfl%C3%B6te-royal-opera-review-%E2%80%93-enjoyable-revival-much-loved-production,4
93,"La Bohème, Royal Opera review - spectacle and sentiment not yet in focus",La Bohème,Royal Opera,2017-09-12,David Nice,"“I’m not in the mood” – “non sono in vena” – sings aspiring poet Rodolfo as he settles down to write a lead article. Was it me, or had the mood not settled by the premiere of the Royal Opera’s first new production of Puccini's structurally perfect favourite for 43 years? The singing was good to occasionally glorious, Antonio Pappano’s conducting predictably idiomatic and supportive. So was it wrong to expect our most imaginative opera director, Richard Jones, to have found his own idiosyncratic angle on a fairly unsinkable masterpiece?At the time of directing Puccini’s The Girl of the Golden West for English National Opera, Jones remarked how the composer and his librettists do so much of the work that it would be daft to mess with it much. Yet his community of gold-rush miners brimmed with finely-observed characterisations, and the final coup, a moving one, stays with me. This Bohème, surprisingly rooted in the 19th century like John Copley’s predecessor, is so far fuzzier round the edges.Maybe more rehearsal time would have helped, or perhaps the opera’s special version of realism is simply at odds with any kind of Jonesian stylisation. Certainly the scene where the Bohemians gather at the Café Momus on Christmas Eve (pictured above with Simona Mihai's Musetta in red) has his trademark straight lines, usually enjoying a special turn of the screw with each new production; so far, at least, this doesn’t quite work. Admirable, at least, to have so much downstage and delivered out front – I suspect the essentials can be clearly seen wherever you happen to be sitting in the Opera House.Jones’s design team of Stewart Laing (sets and costumes) and Mimi Jordan Sherin (lighting) also delivers on something for Royal Opera regulars to coo over in its three illusionist shopping arcades, eventually yielding, not quite seamlessly, to the interior of the café itself. The rest offers subtle twists on what you might expect – a low-beamed attic (7b, for some reason) with corners for the lovesick Rodolfo and Marcello to hide their emotions in, a bare stage with a cabin tavern at the customs post for Act Three (though seemingly on the roof, since the outside of 7b is there at the back). And lots of snow, with convincing simulation from the principals of feeling ""devilish cold"" (""freddo cane""), though no moonlight and no candle-snuffed-out darkness for the start of Mimì’s and Rodolfo’s getting-to-know-you. The end of winter which will signal their ultimate parting casts a cruel green light on the two final chords of Act Three, and the attic has a brighter sun shining in, bad timing for consumptive Mimì’s demise.Which Nicole Car delivers with the necessary sensitivity. Earlier, she’s all impulsiveness – a girl of passionate extremes, we quickly realise when she tells her willing listener of how much the first rays of sun in her room at the start of spring mean to her. Car is so good at the sudden bursts of lyricism, especially affecting in the third and best of the acts here (pictured above with Mariusz Kwiecień's Marcello), Pappano’s febrile but authentically Puccinian/Toscaniniesque sense of movement underpinning her to perfection. Michael Fabiano’s “Che gelida manina” is also carefully paced as the first exchange of confidence. His Rodolfo, though, seems a bit of a jerk – no water to revive a fainting girl as illustrated by Puccini’s pizzicati, just a prod of her inert form with his foot which seems more callous than embarrassed. Here’s a tenor of tireless upper-register strength, convincingly stricken in Act Three but overplaying his hand in the stagey sobs at the end of an otherwise truthful Fourth Act.Vocal quality is also consistent in Mariusz Kwiecień’s Marcello and his Musetta, Simona Mihai, down to sing Mimi in later performances (it might in a future run be an interesting an idea to have the girls switch roles in select performances, like Lia Williams and Juliet Stevenson in the Almeida’s Mary Stuart). Mihai shows us the full ardour beneath the soubrettish posturing, but despite the attention grabbing on the Momus tables, the relationship with Marcello isn’t quite centre stage, and her rich suitor Alcindoro (Wyn Pencarreg), shorn of the usual gags, simply makes no impression.That’s true, too, of the landlord Benoit (Jeremy White), rather more seriously of Florian Sempey’s Schaunard and Luca Tittotto’s Colline – they’re just generic Bohemians with hair to match and stalwart voices. The blokey horseplay doesn’t quite come off with this team, and though the rapid graffiti-ing antics to substitute for the mock dances in Act Four look good (pictured above), they don’t quite tie in with what's being sung. So much here is sensitively done, and well timed with the music, that I wanted to feel for it more. The ingredients are there, but yet unformed. Give it time, the right team and a brushing-up of Act Two and it could yet be a hit.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-boh%C3%A8me-royal-opera-review-spectacle-and-sentiment-not-yet-focus,3
94,"Princess Ida, National Gilbert & Sullivan Opera Company review - sparkling comedy, wobbly sets",Princess Ida,National Gilbert & Sullivan Opera Company,2017-09-01,Richard Bratby,"I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: you have to be pretty silly to take Gilbert and Sullivan seriously. But even sillier not to. And positively heroic to revive the pair’s 1884 three-acter Princess Ida: the show which – updated to a futuristic sushi bar – was responsible in 1992 for one of English National Opera’s all-time great fiascos (well, if you will hire Ken Russell as director...). Vivian Coates’s colourful new production for the National Gilbert & Sullivan Opera Company keeps the action firmly in the cod-medieval Neverland, lifted straight from Tennyson, that G&S specify. You might call it traditional; but for anyone aged under 50 the old D’Oyly Carte way of doing things is barely a folk memory. Seeing a Savoy Opera played straight is actually rather refreshing.But Princess Ida is still a problem piece, thanks largely to a plot whose cheerful mockery of such Victorian hot topics as female education and Darwin’s theory of evolution could easily prompt a 21st century sense of humour failure. If, that is, Gilbert (nothing if not an equal opportunity offender) hadn't spent the whole of Act One holding masculine vanity – whether King Gama’s spiteful bien-pensant meddling or Prince Hilarion’s limp sense of entitlement – up to even more savage ridicule. Gilbert’s real target – as ever – is the absurdity of trying to bend human nature to any rigid system or hierarchy. And as ever, where Gilbert provides the wit, Sullivan supplies the warmth. It’s very noticeable that the proto-feminist Princess is the only character who maintains much in the way of dignity. In the exquisite Act Two quartet The World is But a Broken Toy, the battle of the sexes is temporarily laid aside in a wry acknowledgment of common human folly: but it’s Ida’s voice that soars above the three men.And it certainly soared in this performance at the Malvern Theatres; Emma Walsh’s soprano as Princess Ida (pictured above) blending luminously with Nick Sales (Cyril) Matthew Kellett (Florian) and Laurie Slavin (a winningly light-voiced Prince Hilarion). These four were the heart of a cast studded with Savoyard royalty. Gaynor Keeble – a lacerating Kostelnicka at Longborough last year – clearly enjoyed letting her battleaxe flag fly as the scheming Lady Blanche, maintaining an imperious hauteur even while wearing a broom on her head. Richard Suart (pictured below) and Donald Maxwell, meanwhile, were a little‘n’large dream team as Kings Gama and Hildebrand respectively. Suart ought to be listed as a national treasure: channelling Olivier as Richard III and cackling and lurching about the stage on his crutches like some malignant rubber-faced spider. But even the smaller roles were wittily characterised. Natalie Montakhab was an enjoyably mischievous Lady Psyche, and James Cleverton, Matthew Siveter and Stephen Godward managed to project a certain lumpish amiability even while clanking about the stage in full armour as Gama’s thick-as-mince soldier sons.There was never any question of an ensemble cast this good letting the music do all the work, and Coates drew some richly comic moments from the spoken dialogue too – so important in G&S. When not singing, Walsh projected the brisk, no nonsense manner of Miss Jean Brodie, and there was a definite Carry On vibe about Florian, Cyril and Hilarion’s cross-dressing antics. Smart, lively choreography by Mary MacDonagh complemented some sonorous choral singing, and the operetta-medieval costumes – ranging from doublet and hose for the chaps to some extraordinary disco Valkyrie numbers for Ida’s all-girl army – helped distract from the slightly pantomime-ish scenery.I’m afraid the scenery was one area in which – unlike King Gama – I definitely have something to grumble about. There’s no overwhelming need for a new G&S production to go down the route of a Jonathan Miller-style updating (still less a Ken Russell one), but a cast and a director as classy as this deserve something a bit more imaginative, a bit better made, than unconvincing painted flats. It doesn’t need to be costly, as long as it doesn’t look cheap. And then there’s the orchestra, which sounded bigger and better nourished than on previous NGSOC tours, and proved capable of some extremely eloquent playing (the woodwinds, in particular, really bubbled).But while Aidan Faughey, conducting, kept things bustling along nicely and could deliver an infectious rhythmic kick, there was an overall coarseness of texture, coupled to an occasional raggedness, which prevented Sullivan’s score from working its full magic. English Touring Opera’s Patience earlier this year demonstrated how glorious this music can sound when played with absolute finesse. The NGSOC is doing valuable work with first rate but under-served repertoire, and this hugely enjoyable Princess Ida demonstrates how they continue to raise their game. But the grace, subtlety and melodic invention of Sullivan’s music is only a hair’s breadth from Mendelssohn; and through him, Mozart. No matter how topsy-turvy the action on stage, G&S needs to be conducted like it’s The Marriage of Figaro. Accept nothing less.@RichardBratby",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/princess-ida-national-gilbert-sullivan-opera-company-review-sparkling-comedy-wobbly-sets,4
95,"Prom 61 review: Fleming, Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra, Oramo - heliotropic ecstasies",Prom 61 review: Fleming,Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra,2017-08-31,David Nice,"No sunshine without shadows was one possible theme rippling through this diva sandwich of a Prom. Even Richard Strauss's chaste nymph Daphne, achieving longed-for metamorphosis as a tree, finds darkness among the roots; and though Renée ""The Beautiful Voice"" Fleming has a heliotropic tendency in her refulgent upper register, her mezzo-ish colours are strong, too. Besides, Scandinavians are always aware of transience in sunny summer days, and the outer panels of this curious programme were fine-tuned to that.The opener - ""parking-lot music"" as another Swedish composer, Anders Hillborg, wryly described the slot - was a contemporary one-day butterfly of the all-background, where's-the-main-event variety, a bit of a wasted opportunity. In Liguria (2012), Stockholm-born Andrea Tarrodi gave us her impressions of the ""cinque terre"" way along the Ligurian coast. A colossal storm had washed away some of the hillside when I walked it, so the big thrash at the beginning was not as anti-Italian as some might have thought. Then we waited for a happening; a four-note pattern in the cor anglais seemed to promise it. But not much else; a haze, splashes of colour, a bit of fatuous beach-play led by the xylophone. Well done by Sakari Oramo and the Swedish players; one of those pieces where musicologists talk about the ""sound-world"" because there's not much else to it. Carl Nielsen, on the other hand, never loses his grip for a moment in the Second Symphony - ""Four Temperaments,"" but all belonging to the Geminian composer. I've always loved Nielsen's description of his dreamy younger self, lazing by the harbour on a sunny day, in the phlegmatic lolloping of the second movement. The first is a whirlwind of choleric entertainment tinged by optimism, the third a towering hymn to melancholia always magnificently shaped by Sakari Oramo (pictured above).His real coup - and there's no surer-footed conductor of Nielsen alive today, as the cycle of symphonies with the BBC Symphony Orchestra richly showed - is to make total sense of the tricky finale: all bluster until it, too, hits the reef of melancholy and emerges in a wiser march-vein startlingly akin to Elgar in cheekier Pomp and Circumstance mode - a difficult ending with which to convince, but Oramo nails it. His Stockholm players are slightly less stout and steaky than the BBCSO - violins wiry rather than fully impassioned - but the orchestra's horns are magnificent, its woodwind unusual, especially the very feminine first oboe, and lower colours always keenly etched.The wind made their presence subtly felt, too, in the pastorals of Barber's Knoxville: Summer of 1915 and the epilogue of Strauss's Daphne, where the maiden's rooting to the spot is eerily conveyed by the darker instruments. Fleming wasn't exactly kitted out for James Agee's summer-evening nostalgia - gingham might have been more apt than the glittering gown and wrap - and her opulence was an unusual choice for the piece's essential simplicity (anyone remember Dawn Upshaw, a very different American voice?) But her presence is always sympathetic, the way she engages with the orchestra and seems to enjoy their playing charming. So she carried it off, and if not many of the words were clear from where I was sitting, that's a known Albert Hall anomaly. Barber's best-loved song, ""Sure on this shining night"", made a simple, essential first-half encore.The second-half bonne bouche was Strauss's ""Morgen!"", with one of the orchestra's three concert masters, Andrej Power, as the chief principal singer; and if it showed briefly how Fleming now has to work harder to support softer singing these days, it made the perfect poetic complement to what for me is his most moving operatic finale. Daphne's quiet curtain is a perfect meditation in which the soprano vanishes after her upward-reaching ecstasy, only to be heard from within the body of the tree, duetting with oboe and harp while strings buzz around the laurel. Mythological heaven, and on this evidence it shouldn't be the last we're hearing of Fleming as the often ideal Strauss soprano.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music-opera/prom-61-review-fleming-royal-stockholm-philharmonic-orchestra-oramo,4
96,Edinburgh Festival 2017 review: Verdi's Macbeth - exhilarating and overwhelming,Edinburgh Festival 2017 review: Verdi's Macbeth - exhilarating and overwhelming,,2017-08-21,David Kettle,"Skeletal horses; piles of newborn babies smothered in a bloody sheet; a whole garden centre of prickly pears. There’s no denying that Italian director Emma Dante’s new production of Verdi’s Macbeth, which Turin’s Teatro Regio brings to the Edinburgh International Festival, is visually dazzling, even at times hallucinatory.There’s a nagging concern, however, about what all the visual flamboyance actually adds up to – those perpetually procreating witches, seemingly modelled on the long-haired ghoul from Japanese horror film Ring; the imposing crown-formed decors; the circus fire eaters and acrobats heralding the arrival of King Duncan.Rather than combining together in a singular perspective on Verdi’s dark Shakespeare adaptation, this Macbeth feels like Dante’s deeply personal response, driven seemingly by her own personal mythology. If it doesn’t always make sense, it’s a thrilling ride nonetheless.Back in 1947, it was Glyndebourne that brought Macbeth – the International Festival’s first ever staged opera – to Edinburgh. Seventy years later, Macbeth is the first of two productions from Turin’s Teatro Regio, the International Festival’s resident company for 2017, which also stages an opulent La bohème next week and performs Verdi’s Requiem in the Usher Hall.And it’s hard not to be seduced by the visual splendour of Dante’s production, designed with devil-may-care flair by Carmine Maringola. Their stages are often teeming with hectic activity, alive with movement, the Teatro Regio’s already substantial chorus (put to very good use) joined by actors and a corps de ballet from Palermo to create several memorable images, not least the immense, writhing blood-stained sheet (pictured below) that serves to unify much of the first two acts. Rare episodes when cast members simply stand and sing come as welcome moments of calm and focus in among all the freneticism. Cristian Zucaro’s lighting, too, plays a pivotal role, with figures lurking half-seen in the shadows at the back of the stage.It doesn’t all hit its target. Dante’s recasting of Birnam Wood as a forest of cacti, perhaps drawing on her own Sicilian background, feels faintly ridiculous, as does Lady Macbeth’s elaborate, beautifully choreographed dance with nine self-propelled hospital beds in her sleepwalking scene. But even those images have an unsettling, sometimes uncanny power to them that lodges them in the mind.But if it’s a visually splendid production, then musically it’s just as strong, with a cast of singers all robust and forcefully projected. Marko Mimica is a loyal, big-hearted Banquo, and Gabriele Viviani’s Macbeth treads a fine line between put-upon puppet and angry, ambitious anti-hero, particularly searing in his final death scene, reinstated from Verdi’s original 1847 version. Above all, Oksana Dyka’s Lady Macbeth is a terrifyingly intense creation, unafraid of spitting out her lines or reducing her honeyed tone to a snarl or a howl (it was Verdi, after all, who requested “the voice of a devil” for the role), and commanding both the stage and the opera’s unfolding.Best of all, however, is conductor Gianandrea Noseda’s miraculous Turin band in the pit. Together they give a vivid, raw, feverishly detailed account of Verdi’s score, one that’s alive with telling meaning. This Macbeth is an exhilarating, overwhelming production – even if it’s one that occasionally dispenses with conventional coherence.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/edinburgh-festival-2017-review-verdis-macbeth-exhilarating-and-overwhelming,4
97,"Prom 31 review: La Damnation de Faust, Gardiner - Berlioz tumbles out in rainbow colours",Prom 31 review: La Damnation de Faust,Gardiner,2017-08-09,David Nice,"The road to hell is paved with brilliant ideas in Berlioz's idiosyncratic take on the Faust legend. John Eliot Gardiner proved better than anyone in last night's Prom that this splendidly lopsided ""dramatic legend"" can only be weakened by its many stagings; all the drama is in the music, and especially in the orchestra, from rollicking country dances and fanfaring Hungarians through to the shrieking night birds on the ride to the abyss and the six harps dappling the plains of heaven in what for modern tastes is a quite unnecessary ""Epilogue in Heaven"" for redeemed Marguerite.Gardiner is a leaping, rather than walking, advertisement for the adage that age only makes you younger; he tore through the livelier scenes with the sharpest of edges from his Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique. Youth was mostly an advantage for the many choruses, stage-managed presumably by the conductor but ostensibly by Laurent Naouri's charismatic Mephistopheles (pictured below). With the young men from the National Youth Choir of Scotland - following on from the GB equivalent in the previous evening's Prom - the drunken fugal ""Amen"" for the death of a rat sounded splendidly like a laugh-out-loud football chorus. And what a great idea to have them as ""Students"" contrasting with the ""Soldiers"" of the Monteverdi Choir in what is usually - but not here - an anticlimactic ending to Part Two.Only the rollicking Pandemonium of Mephistopheles' reception in hell could have done with a few more mature voices to bolster it, but it had an agility as rare as Naouri's high-speed delivery of the leering Serenade - a payoff in having a baritone rather than a bass for the devil, a singular gesticulator at that. Ashley Riches could sing the part anon, too, on the evidence of his chorus-leader Brander.In Michael Spyres we have a great tenor stylist for the French repertoire, as his earlier appearance with Chelsea Opera Group in Massenet's Le Roi de Lahore and his more recent evening with Joyce El-Khoury and Carlo Rizzi already told us (someone had better book him for Massenet's Le Cid soonest). His intelligence and colour brought significance to every phrase - just as well, because we'd gone back to the bad Proms habit of no supertitles after the false dawn of Sunday's Khovanshchina; who could doubt the meaning of ""je souffre"" as Faust prepares to take his own life? And if the ""Invocation to Nature"" usually calls for a heftier kind of of tenor, he got round that one with focused tone-colour, too, promising a long and useful vocal life.It was also a huge pleasure to hear mezzo Ann Hallenberg out of Handelian trouser-roles - a feminine and youthful object of desire, perhaps lacking some sensuality and the ultimate poignancy in the great Lament - who can forget Christine Rice at ENO? - but blending well with Spyres in the love duet and always graceful of stage presence. Of the many orchestral solo partners for the singers, standing Bach Passion-style, Michael Niesemann's cor anglais sounded more like a ghost behind Marguerite than another human voice, but that's the period instrument for you. Will-o-the-wisp piccolos at one end of the scale and galumphing ophicleides - early tubas - at the other made their mark; the strings were always elegant, portamento often making a nice substitute for vibrato.If the first half was unalloyed pleasure, the second had just a few moments where comparisons with performances more moving and more apocalyptic in turn might not have helped it. But the final let-down, the wet acceptance of Marguerite into heaven, is Berlioz's.It glided and shone as well as it could, and the Albert Hall with its halo around the sound was still the best possible place to hear it. But Mahler in the Faust-finale of his Eighth Symphony does it so much better (and, like Goethe, unlike Berlioz, he allows his Faust to be redeemed by the ""eternal feminine"").

They're needed more than ever in Musorgsky's typically quirky survey of rival interest-groups at the beginning of young Tsar Peter I's reign, though I like to think that newcomers to Khovanshchina (""The Khovansky Business"") would have got the message about each formidable personage and scene without them, so vivid was this realisation of the way Musorgsky characterises roistering princes, humble scribes and calm Old Believers.Semyon Bychkov revealed the inexorable flow and the frequent shocks of a score commonly held as ""ragged"" and ""fragmentary"" (Proms programme), the incredible beauty rather than harshness of what here was mostly Shostakovich's timbre-perfect orchestration - Musorgsky left the opera unfinished and mostly unscored at his death - and the way the orchestra underpins every gesture from what was here a first-rate team of leading singers from eight nations.With very discreet intervention from director Paul Curran to place the characters, and lights coming into their own for the final great blaze (pictured above) - why not, too, for the opening ""Dawn on the Moscow River""? - this still remained the clearest of concert performances, rather than what have come to be called ""concert stagings"": the polar opposite to Graham Vick's Khovanskygate in a big Birmingham tent, possibly the most extraordinary operatic event I've ever experienced, pleading the chaos of the opera as a worldwide phenomenon very pertinent to today's demagoguery, not just a Russian tragedy. That this Prom worked at the same level of intensity but in an entirely different way ranks it as another major achievement.The gorgeous flexibility Bychkov got from the BBC Symphony Orchestra in the radiant Prelude showed that his was not going to be a relentlessly black-earth interpretation (if only he could have applied this kind of suppleness to Mozart's Cosi fan tutte at the Royal Opera). It seemed that his understanding of the superb Russian text by Musorgsky himself meant that the drama had to move at the natural pace of human speech, so there was no room for lingering. Cast-wise, the quality began as it would continue, with the Scribe of Norbert Ernst more heroic than character-tenor in timbre, ringing out in the Albert Hall, and George Gagnidze a formidable characteriser from the start as Shaklovity, the boyar who will assure eventual control for the young regent.Audience jaws dropped less for Croatian Ante Jerkunica's virile Ivan Khovansky (pictured above on the right with Gagnidze) - hopes had been for the massive authority of an older bass, while this one was lean and not too strong at the top of the register - than for Estonian Ain Anger's Dosifey, leader of the Old Believers. Many will remember their amazement when that colossal and beautiful tone first hit us in the Proms Tannhäuser. How it fills the space, and how a single resonant note can make you quiver with emotion. A bass in a thousand, absolutely.Every inch the other star, and rich in her vocal colouring of a beguiling, slightly enigmatic character, was Elena Maximova as Marfa (pictured below), under Dosifey's guidance but also, perplexingly, a seer with pagan roots and a sensualist, one-time lover of Ivan's son Andrey (Christopher Ventris, as youthful-sounding in helden-lyric tenor territory as he'd been singing Siegmund in the Budapest Ring, and usefully contrasted with the sharper edge of the evening's other leading tenor, Vsevolod Grivnov, as cultured Prince Golitsyn). The pair's awed anticipation of the end was surely the most moving stretch of the evening, and that's saying something. It's a shame Bychkov didn't favour the more spiritual apocalypse of Ravel and Stravinsky for Diaghilev; this one felt too abrupt, but full marks to the conductor for making other smaller changes to the Shostakovich version. If Maximova had a tendency to press forward in her dramatic urgency, Bychkov was there to follow her, and otherwise he kept a magisterial grip on the drama, always attentive to every colour. With cor anglais player Alison Teale riveting in sorrowful humility and slinky oriental mode, violas and cellos humanising their characters, horns colouring one of Dosifey's noblest exits to startling effect and a general sheen which could only be compared to Abbado's Vienna recording of the work, the BBCSO sounded as world-class here as it did last year for the late Jiří Bělohlávek's account of Janáček's The Makropulos Affair.The essential Slavic quality to religious chants and mass assertions of fearfulness and sorrow came from the Slovak Philharmonic Chorus, working alongside a full-strength BBC Singers. At first their responses as a single character teasing and threatening violence to the Scribe could have done with a bit more vivid drama, but Bychkov did the extra work with the orchestra in the scene where Ivan Khovansky's unruly guard, the Streltsy, are brought to book, a tableau which ends in one of many spellbinding quiet choruses. The ultimate achievement rests with a great conductor and master-dramatist, persuading me as no other interpreter has done in the live performances I've seen that the musical values of the work are as unremittingly high as the dramatic contrasts.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/prom-29-review-bbcso-bychkov-musorgskys-khovanshchina-sears-concert,5
99,"La clemenza di Tito, Glyndebourne review - fine musical manoeuvres in the dark",La clemenza di Tito,Glyndebourne,2017-07-27,David Nice,"So much light in the Glyndebourne production of Brett Dean's Hamlet; so much darkness in Mozart's La clemenza di Tito according to director Claus Guth. Something is irredeemably rotten in the state of ancient Rome, at odds with the fundamental enlightenment and radiance of Mozart's last complete opera. And yet the basis is a sentimental one: two little boys playing around a lake not dissimilar to Glyndebourne's grow up for one – the fundamentally loving Sesto – to betray the other, Emperor Titus. Is the shooting of a wild magpie which betrayed the idyll to be replayed in adult human terms? I wish I cared more.The wild reedbeds of the two leading characters' childhood are still there against a pitch-black background; above, when the video of the past isn't playing – with a technical hitch through last night's Overture – two grim neo-classical rooms represent the Roman palace, often populated by that cliche of concept opera, men in black suits (played by both sexes of the ever-game and resonant Glyndebourne chorus and unnecessary extra actors). Christian Schmidt's designs don't really work, half messy naturalism, half metaphor (one we actually could have done with in the much worse Glyndebourne production of Mozart's La finta giardiniera, where the crumbling ballroom failed to capture the contrast between civilization and the wilds).It's a pity, because much of what is acted and sung out against this is the best of personenregie, the director's art of getting the singers to engage humanly and meaningfully with each other, and has focus and fire (pictured above: the Emperor's beloved prospective consort Berenice is sent away for state reasons). What we see would be possible in just about any setting including the Roman (Glyndebourne's last and only previous production, by Nicholas Hytner, had pretty Pompeiian reds and blues framing a tepid drama). The revelatory clarity and flexible expression Glyndebourne Music Director Robin Ticciati draws from the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment are matched by nearly all the singing from superb stylists.Yet even here there's a catch. The decent, ritual-trapped Emperor, Richard Croft – a superb replacement for Steve Davislim, who left owing to ""differences"" – looks twice the age of his best friend Sesto (wondrous Anna Stéphany an equally silvery replacement for Kate Lindsey, who found herself with child). Not only does it take longer to twig that they're the two boys of the video sequences, but the relationship seems more that of father Idomeneo and son Idamante in Mozart's earlier, more ambitious opera seria masterpiece.Alice Coote's Vitellia (pictured below with Stéphany and Clive Bayley's Publio), full of colours and perceptive patches of interpretation, is also more of Tito's generation than that of the young people in the cast (the others are Michèle Losier as Sesto's friend Annio, a more likely candidate for the boy friend and making a huge impression in her fine Act Two aria, and the meltingly musical Joélle Harvey as Annio's beloved Servilia, at one brief point slated to be the Emperor's consort). Coote sometimes overshoots the mark, though not as gravely as in her recent concert performance of Handel's Ariodante, in which role my colleague Alexandra Coghlan admired her far more than I did. We need a bit of sexy seduction in the lovely upward chromatic figures to which Mozart sets the word ""alletta"" (""allures"") in her first aria; the great final Rondo is played as a hit-and-miss mad scene with the house lights up (why?), its motivation not quite developing from what's gone before.Stéphany, though, is a revelation – at least to anyone who didn't see her second-cast Octavian in the Royal Opera Der Rosenkavalier. Here, as there, she looks the handsome lead boy to perfection; and it's so exciting to hear a youthful mezzo voice flexible enough to do anything. Ticciati supports her to the hilt with space and the odd silence in her two tremendous set pieces (credits really due in the programme to the basset clarinet obbligato soloist, as for the basset horn in Vitellia's ""Non più di fiori"" - now, thanks to a commenter below, identifiable respectively as Katherine Spencer and Antony Pay).The conductor's ""speaking"" pauses, a feature of his work at Glyndebourne ever since the touring Jenůfa, are reflected in less successful ones during the recitative – the director's responsibility, I'm guessing – which hold up the drama rather than turning the screw as intended. They become maddening in Tito's anguish at whether to execute or pardon his treacherous best friend in Act Two; Richard Croft does his best to draw us into the emperor's head, but it doesn't quite work. The cumulative aria ""Se all'impero,"" though, couldn't be finer; having started in Act One a bit under the note, Croft nails both the music and the expression in tandem with the OAE's flaming violin arpeggios. After all, this is a gift from the nub of Mozart's enlightened take on an old opera seria text, for all its toadying to the newly-crowned Emperor Leopold: ""If I cannot assure the loyalty of my realms by love, I care not for a devotion born of fear."" Not a common sentiment among today's demagogues.That turning-point ought to herald a genuinely happy ending. But while Tito's liberation as the soaring magpie is partial cause for joy, we see him handing over power to the sinister manipulator Publio (Clive Bayley, suitably cold and lugubrious). No regie director ever allowed a happy ending if he or she could help it; so what started in the dark ends in the dark. All's definitely not well that ends well in this Clemency; and again that's a shame, because the performance of the music breathes sweetness and light.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-clemenza-di-tito-glyndebourne-review-fine-musical-manoeuvres-dark,3
100,"Le nozze di Figaro, Clonter Opera review - a wedding full of future stars",Le nozze di Figaro,Clonter Opera,2017-07-24,Robert Beale,"Clonter Opera is a finishing school for young opera performers, with its own well appointed theatre and professional administration and artistic direction, based on a farm in Cheshire near Jodrell Bank. It’s seen a succession of promising young post-conservatoire singers come to perform in fully staged productions for many years, and is also (from an audience point of view) the only countryside summer opera venue of any substance in the north of England. It even manages to accommodate the entire house capacity with proper, covered eating facilities under its roof – appropriate to the local weather and in that respect outdoing Glyndebourne.The fun of seeing a Clonter show lies mainly in spotting those among its casts who may turn out to be star names of the future, but in recent years its production and musical standards have been raised ever higher, with Clive Timms at the musical helm (conducting the reduced-score Clonter Sinfonia) and Robin Humphreys assisting, alongside some talented directors. Their intensive work over two weeks can bring remarkable results.Such is the case with Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro . Director Stephen Medcalf – who has created imaginative and telling productions for Opera North and Buxton Festival, among others – sets it in Spain (where else?), but in the 20th century: the fascist period, actually. That gives him and designer Nate Gibson the chance to pay homage to Dali and Gaudi in the setting (though in a minimalist way) and to put Count Almaviva into army uniform and make him a seriously sinister character, while Figaro is apparently his chauffeur as well as factotum. If I hadn’t read the programme note, I might have thought it was a variation on the later episodes of Downton Abbey, but then I suppose the charmless aristocracy and their households were much the same all over Europe in the thirties.Clive Timms urges the music along with impeccable timing and precision, ever attentive but with a team of principals who clearly know their stuff and hardly need his prompting. The ensembles were very fine indeed, in balance and impact. Margo Arsane (Susanna) and Henry Neill (Figaro) stood out from the opening scene. She’s just graduated from the Guildhall (and before that Lyon and Munich) and is a most accomplished performer, acting and reacting to the story all the time, and her soprano is pure and clear, with power available but never over-used. He is a product of the Royal Academy opera school and a gifted actor-singer with a well developed tone and bags of energy and charm. ""Se vuol ballare"" set the pace, and he never looked back.The others have much to offer, too: Josep-Ramon Olivé as Almaviva (pictured above), another Guildhall product, has confidence and stage presence, Andrew Irwin (Chetham’s and the Royal Welsh College) brings a burnished tone and a fine comic gift as both Basilio and Curzio, while Angharad Lyddon (Royal Academy) as Cherubino sings ""Voi che sapete"" delightfully and has mastered the art, and walk, of being a girl playing a boy who at times is pretending to be a girl.Elizabeth Skinner (Guildhall) is the Countess – she brings a lovely mature sound to her role; Eugene Dillon-Hooper (RNCM) is an imperious but believable Dr Bartolo, with Jade Moffat (Guidhall) a finely sung Marcellina. There were good contributions from Edward Robinson (RNCM) as Antonio and Corinne Cowling (Guildhall) as Barbarina, completing an impressive cast list. Of course you get no chorus in a Clonter production, but the team did their best to make up for that.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/le-nozze-di-figaro-clonter-opera-review-wedding-full-future-stars,4
101,"Prom 9 review: Fidelio, BBCPO, Mena - classy prison drama rarely blazes",Prom 9 review: Fidelio,BBCPO,2017-07-22,David Nice,"What a pity Beethoven never composed an appendage to Fidelio called The Sorrows of Young Marzelline. One crucial moment apart, the music he gives to his second soprano in his only opera isn't his best, but Louise Alder so lived the role of the gaoler's daughter in love with a woman disguised as a man that everything else felt rather less intense. It's only fair to say that there were other singers facing bigger challenges very stylishly, for the most part, but neither they nor the BBC Philharmonic under its chief conductor Juanjo Menja made us feel as though their lives depended on the outcome. And that ultimate lack of blazing commitment, in what should be the most incandescent of prison dramas, sold it all a bit short.True, this was an unashamed concert-performance Prom with no directorial supervision, principals delivering score-free – with one exception, James Creswell, a more than adequate late replacement for Brindley Sherratt as gaoler Rocco – in front of the orchestra, with co-ordination not always the tightest. This, Beethoven's much more celebrated revision of the original Leonore swapping drama for a pageant-finale, worked best in that oratorio-like final scene – though like much else it was bright and pleasant rather than shattering or deeply moving. It was hard to come from the Chamber Orchestra of Europe under Haitink, projecting every phrase of Mozart and Schumann into the Albert Hall space, and be brought back down to earth with the more usual situation of fuzzy strings lacking ideal bite. No doubt the answer would be to stand in the Arena, an occasional option, but no way was this playing on the same level. And the horns were having a bad night.Nor was focus always there in Ricarda Merbeth's Leonore (pictured above with Stuart Skelton – nice dress, but a trouser suit would have been more appropriate for the heroine's male disguise). Her lower middle-range tended to disappear in these acoustics, though it was obvious why she's a fit for the part: no soprano I've heard live has essayed the testing top so fully or flawlessly. None, either, has made clearer work of what can be a treacherous bark of a duet when the wife who's risked her life for her political-prisoner husband is finally reunited with him. Stuart Skelton could manage it, too, though even he was tested by the ludicrous high vision of ""an angel, Leonore"" at the end of his aria: perhaps it can only work as part of a stage performance delivered in extremis. Skelton was otherwise palpably in control, phrasing stylishly and weighting the big entry on the word ""Gott"", swelling it as only a heroic tenor can.Villainous prison governor Pizarro can only work at a level of testosterone-driven edginess; Detlef Roth conveyed nothing more than a petulant bank-manager, despite a couple of energetic footstamps. Creswell's subordinate could have eaten him for breakfast; as they sang alongside each other, one got the feeling of the same mésalliance as when King Philip in Verdi's Don Carlos has more vocal power than the only one supposedly lording it over him, the Grand Inquisitor. We could have done with more colours and force from the Orfeón Donostiarra, Spain's finest choral society, playing their compatriots albeit singing in German, but emphatically not the essential professional opera chorus. Better, perhaps, to have assembled voices from the London music colleges.Only the three not-so-long graduated young Brits in the cast offered perfection. Alder (pictured above with Mena), having made her surprise Proms debut three years ago stepping in as the Glyndebourne cover Sophie in Der Rosenkavalier, has deservedly shot to fame since then, winning the Dame Joan Sutherland Audience Prize at the BBC 2017 Cardiff Singer of the World Competition, and she owns the stage. Her launch of the great canon-quartet ""Mir ist so wunderbar"" provided the one truly moving moment of the evening. Tenor Benjamin Hulett was a fine match as the lad her Marzelline treats so badly, and David Soar declaimed to perfection as deus ex machina Don Fernando. But inevitably their subordinate roles were limited.Amplifying the (minimal) spoken dialogue meant a plunge in levels for the music. Cultivated, mostly lively orchestral playing just needed more heft, despite excellent work from timpanist Paul Turner. It didn't tell the story by itself, and given that the Proms organisers still won't provide supertitle screens around the hall – it can be done – more of the performers needed to work harder to carry the narrative and compel focus from those in the audience with their heads in the programme.Next page: watch Louise Alder sing 'No word from Tom' from Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress at the BBC Cardiff Singer of the World Competition",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/prom-9-review-fidelio-bbcpo-mena-classy-prison-drama-rarely-blazes,3
102,"Jette Parker Young Artists Summer Performance, Royal Opera review - vocal promise, poor stagecraft",Jette Parker Young Artists Summer Performance,Royal Opera,2017-07-18,David Nice,"They get to work with the best music and language coaches in the business. They make their mark in small parts throughout the Royal Opera season and showcase their art more prominently at the end of it, proving to the world that there are major talents among them (four outstanding ones, I reckon, on this showing). The big question mark is why, for this crucial event, the Jette Parker singers were saddled with one director, also on the Programme, and a movement co-ordinator who seem to have been little help with the interaction between characters, with feeling comfortable in their skins and not having to resort to stock gestures.I’ll get over the carping and celebrate the abundant excellence of this year’s singers shortly. But take the opening excerpt, early Verdi at his original best in the opening scene of I due Foscari's second act. Only a solo viola and cello set the sombre mood, superbly taken by Royal Opera principals under the experienced guidance of David Syrus. Tenor David Junghoon Kim proved as idiomatic as they, Italianate to the life; we saw that his Jacopo Foscari is in prison, we heard that he’s terrorised by phantoms. But who was this woman in smart business wear and high heels, circling him like a potential Miss Whippy and keeping her distance until he finally rushes unconvincingly into her arms? Supposedly his faithful wife Lucrezia, deeply concerned for him, but you wouldn’t know it from the way the two (pictured below) ended up standing apart and waving their arms about in repetitive gestures. Only the fine singing of the long phrases in the final stretta allowed Vlada Borovko to escape from the straitjacket in which director Gerard Jones had placed her. He'd already made a dog's dinner of the vocally excellent Wilton's Handel Oreste, sub-student style; that should have set alarm bells ringing.And so it went on, in one poorly-etched scene after another. The second, the tender love-duet of Cinderella and her Prince Charming at the ball of Massenet’s Cendrillon, had a surprisingly ill-at-ease Angela Simkin, whom I've heard sing so much better,  in the trousers role, a replacement for the unwell Emily Edmonds as the ""unknown beauty"", Kate Howden, and unidiomatic conducting from Matthew Scott Rogers. In what followed, three singers were truly at their ease – Nigerian-born American soprano Francesca Chiejina, radiant of facial expression and opulent of voice when needed opposite the equally stage-confident and vocally distinctive Thomas Atkins in a delicious little pastoral from Mascagni’s L’Amico Fritz, and Jennifer Davis, whom I’d already seen and heard excel alongside Atkins in this year's Europe Day Concert at St John’s Smith Square, amazing us with the ideal Straussian bloom at the top of the voice in the final scene of Arabella. Poor Gyula Nagy, as her Mr Right who’s gone and done everything wrong but is to be forgiven, had no help at all as the music of her staircase descent unfolded to an unseen slow entrance; Nagy's Mandryka was left to pace back and forth three times, to no effect, and vocally he didn't fit the part (it's essentially a bass-baritone rather than a baritone role). Amateurish blocking marred what should have been a very funny trio from Rossini’s Le comte Ory, too, though there was real promise in the crisp musical guidance of another Jette Parker Young Artist, repetiteur and conductor James Hendry.With half the Second Act of Don Giovanni - from the great Sextet onwards - to conclude, we were on safer ground: known territory and an ideal sense of Mozartian pace and vitality from Syrus (having come straight from Haitink’s unsurpassable Mozart at the afternoon Prom, I was struck by the good fortune of getting his one-time sidekick at the Royal Opera as another ideal interpreter, and the singers must have been grateful, too). There wasn’t too much meddling with the arias. Davis’s ""Mi tradi"" (the soprano pictured above with Nagy) and Atkins’ ""Il mio tesoro"" were performances you’d be delighted to hear in a main Royal Opera production, very stylish, with excellent breath control, and dramatically firm; Borovko, less easy on stage, sang under the note in the slow section of ""Non mi dir"" but it was all there in essence - not easy in this fiendish aria - and she can manage the coloratura in the final sequence, unlike many Donna Annas I’ve heard.Nagy seemed more in his element as Giovanni than as Mandryka; there had clearly been a lot of hard work on the Italian sparring with his Leporello, David Shipley. Jones G had clearly taken a leaf out of Jones R's playbook in a few touches; but the denouement still didn’t work. Much better the moral final ensemble, with the three singers from the Rossini scene – Chiejina, Simkin and Kim – incorporated to add lustre to a glamorous final line-up. All good enough to give hope for the future, and a pointer to at least four singers who have top-league careers ahead of them.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/jette-parker-young-artists-summer-performance-royal-opera-review-vocal-promise-poor-stagecraft,3
103,"Katya Kabanova, Opera Holland Park review - clarity and pace in Janáček's Volga tragedy",Katya Kabanova,Opera Holland Park,2017-07-17,Gavin Dixon,"Katya Kabanova is an ideal fit for Opera Holland Park’s verismo-focussed programming. It’s Czech, of course, but the dramatic style is very close to the Italian opera of the day, the story all gritty realism, the music punctuated with intense emotive episodes. This staging, a revival of Olivia Fuchs’s 2009 production, does the work full justice, a straightforward account that doesn’t overcomplicate the clear-cut narrative and morality. Musically, too, this was an impressive performance, with Sian Edwards (pictured below with the orchestra) leading a well-paced account, nuanced but with no holding back at those searing climaxes.The opera is based on a Russian play, The Storm by Aleksandr Ostrovsky. Katya is unhappily married to Tichon, who is controlled by his manipulative mother, Kabanicha. When Kabanicha orders Tichon away on business, Katya embarks on an affair with Boris, spurred on by Varvara, the family’s adopted daughter. When Tichon returns, Katya confesses all, and ultimately throws herself in the river Volga.Janáček took little interest in the Russian setting, so designer Yannis Thavoris is wise to give the production a more abstract 19th-century feel. The scenes alternate between indoor and outdoor settings, but here we basically have a single set, the large stage floor lit in blue with wooden walkways running across – the Volga a ubiquitous presence throughout and a recurring symbol of fate. For the indoor scenes, a rotating circular platform is positioned stage right. At the start, it is filled with Victorian drawing room furniture and half enclosed with an arching metal grille, a powerful symbol of Katya’s oppression in the family home. Later, when Katya and Boris meet and furtively declare their love, they step from the walkway into the ""water"", Boris first and then Katya following, a similarly potent indicator of the social transgression of their actions.That’s about it for directorial intervention, with Fuchs otherwise presenting Janáček’s drama as is. The dysfunctional family dynamic at the start of the opera is powerfully conveyed, with Nicky Spence and Anne Mason as Tichon and Kabanicha an unsettling but wholly convincing mother and son (pictured below with Julia Sporsén and Clare Presland). Both sing well, and Mason in particular manages dominate the huge orchestral accompaniments she is typically given. Julia Sporsén is gripping in the title role. She doesn’t have a particularly elegant tone, especially at the top, but she is secure and sings with a real dramatic intensity. For the love music with Boris, she produces a completely different tone, soft, round and utterly endearing. Peter Hoare matches her as Boris. It’s not much of a role, and Janáček doesn’t present him as particularly complex, so Hoare’s reliable tenor and amiable stage presence fit the bill.As usual at Holland Park, the supporting roles are well cast, and include some very fine voices. Clare Presland produces a clear and elegant tone for the role of Varvara, the scheming mezzo of the piece. The short libretto manages to squeeze in a subplot about her romance with Kudrjaš. Paul Curievici doesn’t quite match her for tonal control, but his blustering stage persona makes for an entertaining dynamic between the pair. Dikòj, Boris’s uncle, appears at the start of several scenes, his narrations filling in context and background. The Russian bass Mikhail Svetlov sounds suitably weighty here, with the sort of mature but still fresh voice that’s invaluable for such roles.A large chorus is assembled. They don’t have much to sing, but Fuchs makes good use of them as a largely mute observing crowd – great costumes too. The orchestra was a little rough round the edges to begin with, but found their form by the end of the first act. The brass and percussion were particularly effective in the storm music and at all the various emotional climaxes. A special mention for timpanist Tim Gunnell, whose incisive fate motif punctuates the score.The airy and open-sided Holland Park pavilion doesn’t lend itself to the psychological claustrophobia that Janáček seeks, but Sian Edwards still managed to deliver plenty of intensity and focus. Rather than leitmotifs for the characters, Janáček employs different moods in the music to depict each, and Edwards did an excellent job of delineating these separate styles. She deserves much credit for the success of this revival, as does the entire cast for the compelling musical drama they make of this ensemble piece.@saquabote",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/katya-kabanova-opera-holland-park-review-clarity-and-pace-jan%C3%A1%C4%8Deks-volga-tragedy,4
104,"El-Khoury, Spyres, Hallé, Rizzi, Cadogan Hall review - bel canto lives again",El-Khoury,Spyres,2017-07-15,David Nice,"Unless you're an undiscriminating fan of bel canto, the lesser Italian and French operas of the 1830s and '40s - that's to say, not Verdi's Nabucco and Macbeth or Berlioz's Benvenuto Cellini - need to be approached with caution. Once you've lowered expectations to a simpler level of compositional style, you then have to hope for stylists of the first order to make it work. That doesn't happen too often these days, but the inspirational company Opera Rara, responsible for this often spectacular programme of operatic excerpts, knows where to find them. In soprano Joyce El-Khoury, tenor Michael Spyres and, an equal partner in the pleasures of the evening, conductor Carlo Rizzi conducting an amazingly idiomatic Hallé, it found the magic recipe for showcase success.It was as well to have it announced that the Lebanese-Canadian soprano was recovering from a cold; catarrh stops the flow in lyric lines, and that was occasionally apparent. But what a spectacular voice this is, allied - as with Spyres - to supreme musicianship. The top makes the ears ring, but can also be reduced to a sliver of sound in true bel canto style; the stage presence is perfect, dramatic evocation economical but crystal-clear. El-Khoury, Spyres and Rizzi (pictured below by Neil Bennett) between them managed to rebirth the excerpts from the one opera I thought I knew well, Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor, culminating in a shared ability to sing the eight-bar melodic phrases of the Act 1 duet in a single breath. Sheer artistry.But what of the unfamiliar, its presence linked by repertoire for two apparently great singers of the 19th century, Julie Doras-Grace and Gilbert Duprez? The best cases were made for an aria and duet from Halévy's Guido et Ginevra - interestingly orchestrated in what, we were told, are reminiscences of the hero's early Romance, and with a high quotient of melodic originality - and the Act 1 air from Auber's Le lac des fées. Spyres always makes a good case for an unorthodox turn of phrase. His beaten-bronze sound in the French repertoire is ideal; even if the high notes are never actually thrilling - he got there without the bottling which troubled me in the Royal Opera's Mitridate - the middle range is perfectly valorous, and he always projects the meaning of the text.More stock-in-trade were the numbers from Meyerbeer's Robert le Diable - lovely phrasing of the crucial word ""grâce"" from El-Khoury, though - Rossini's Otello (the hero's entrance cavatina) and Hérold's Le Pré aux clercs, bland material despite the violin solo beautifully taken by Hallé leader Simon Blendis. The Hallé's first trumpet, Gareth Small, also gilded his bel canto spotlight with handsomely applied vibrato to the Halévy aria and the Pas de Six from Donizetti's La Favorite, much more original as ballet music than Verdi's Paris divertissement for the recast I Lombardi, Jerusalem. Verdi's glory days as a dance master were yet to come, while Donizetti surprises us with orchestral sophistication, especially in a delicious duet for the two oboes.It was hard not to feel a sudden affection for this pisseur of 70-odd operas at his best; time to go and listen to the Opera Rara recording of Les Martyrs featuring the evening's two stars - appropriately they served up a powerhouse duet from that rediscovered grand opera as their encore - plus their two discs, soon to be released but available last night, including the concert's plums. Not, perhaps, since Nelly Miricioiu revived the bel canto art towards the end of her career have its possibilities seemed so exciting.Next page: watch a short excerpt of El-Khoury, Spyres and Rizzi recording the Act 1 Duet from Lucia di Lammermoor",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/el-khoury-spyres-hall%C3%A9-rizzi-cadogan-hall-review-bel-canto-lives-again,4
105,"The Magic Flute, Longborough Festival review - sparkling and moving",The Magic Flute,Longborough Festival,2017-07-14,stephen Walsh,"About The Magic Flute there’s a certain amount of domestic theatre and a great deal of pantomime. It calls for fun, sentiment, movement, a measure of spectacle, and plenty of direct communication with the audience. But like the mechanicals’ play in A Midsummer Night’s Dream it needs no excuse, no big ideas.At Longborough, Thomas Guthrie flirts briefly with such things. A boy lies in bed reading, I suppose, a fairy-tale; Papageno appears brushing his teeth; Tamino and Pamina come on, inexplicably, as puppets (that return momentarily for the ordeals). But these are fleeting concepts, swiftly abandoned in favour of an evening that sparkles and moves, in every sense, looks stylish and unfussy, and mostly works beautifully on the musical level.Partly thanks to Anthony Negus’s alert conducting, Guthrie paces this Flute much better than he did Figaro last year. With an open stage, back curtain, and minimal props (designer Ruth Paton), the performance nips along from scene to scene. It has wit, but not much slapstick. Glasses of water are handed up through trap doors; the boys wheel Pamina off in a barrow; Papageno’s suicide noose is held up by one of Sarastro’s priests. But magic is in comparatively short supply, and Wayne Dowdeswell’s lighting, for once, has its dud moments, notably with the unlit, unreadable, boards announcing the scenes.But I like the way the production promotes the music above everything else, and is intriguingly, if sometimes oddly cast. Not once are Mozart and Schikaneder upstaged and here and there they will be smiling in heaven. Beate Mordal, a lively Susanna last year, is an unforgettable Pamina, a natural, compulsively watchable actress, and with lovely, burnished tone that brought tears to the eyes in “Ach, ich fühl’s,” false tragedy though it is, but could also soften touchingly for her picaresque duets with Grant Doyle’s Papageno.Doyle himself (pictured right) makes a likeable, rather than rib-tickling Papageno, good vocally in the folksy idiom – so different from Figaro’s music, in which he shone last year. He could do with more dialogue, done here (as with Fidelio, but more acceptably) in English against the sung German. Julian Hubbard is in many ways an extraordinary Tamino, a strapping but well focused tenor who sings Mozart as if it were late Verdi, and – remarkably enough – gets away with it by sheer conviction. It’s a voice one could imagine as Radames or even Otello, hardly Don Ottavio or Ferrando.Jihoon Kim, from Korea, is also a somewhat unusual Sarastro, rather ponderous in his handling of the German, heavy-toned but impressive and dignified, especially in “O Isis und Osiris”. Hanna Dahlenburg is more in the conventional vein of Queens of the Night, brilliant and mostly precise in the upper regions she has to inhabit vocally while roaming the nether regions in person. Her three attendants are superb: Katherine Crompton, Sioned Gwen Davies and Carolyn Dobbin, and no less good are the three boys, transmogrified here into “spirits” because sung by girls (Rosie Lomas, Lucy Knight, Olympia Hetherington). If you regret the loss of boyish purity here as I do a bit, you can try to squeeze into alternate performances where real boys are cast. But you’ll probably have to steal a ticket. Benjamin Bevan is a stylish, reassuring Speaker, Colin Judson a late stand-in as an athletic, if not very diabolical Monostatos, a “Wild Things” cook with spatula.Negus moves from Wagner to Mozart without a tremor. As an assistant at WNO versatility was his second name, and listening to this expertly paced Flute one wonders how many other first-rate British conductors are languishing in the rehearsal rooms of our big-name-obsessed opera companies (Richard Farnes at Opera North, now voluntarily spending more time with his family, is a spectacular case in point, though he did get one top job). But Negus has made Longborough musically, and that’s more than most conductors could or would have done.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/magic-flute-longborough-festival-review-sparkling-and-moving,4
106,"Buxton Festival review - early Verdi, earlier Mozart and refreshing Britten",Buxton Festival review - early Verdi,earlier Mozart and refreshing Britten,2017-07-10,Richard Bratby,"“The subject is neither political nor religious; it is fantastical” wrote Verdi to the librettist Piave about his opera Macbeth. “The opera is not about the rise of a modern fascist: nor is it about political tyranny. It is a study in character” adds director Elijah Moshinsky in the programme for this opening production of the 2017 Buxton International Festival. To which (at least if your last encounter with Macbeth was Welsh National Opera’s production last year, seemingly set in a Travelodge somewhere near Edinburgh Airport) it’s tempting to respond, for this relief much thanks.Moshinsky has gone for the relatively rarely performed 1847 Florence version of the opera – part of a focus on early Verdi at Buxton that saw him direct a stylish Giovanna d’Arco in 2015 and which will culminate in a new production of Alzira next year. We lose Lady Macbeth’s La luce langue and the final chorus, as well as the ballet music that always gets chopped now anyway. In its place we gain a swift, cinematic pace coupled to an almost forensic focus on the two central characters – concluding with a stark dying aria for Macbeth himself.The production strips things back too. Designer Russell Craig’s drab reddish box of a set serves for all four acts, and the lighting is so gloomy that for the first few minutes I thought there’d been a technical malfunction. There are no props beyond a few benches and the odd dagger, and the costumes are opera-generic, with plenty of the inevitable trenchcoats and leather jerkins. True, there’s no clumsily shoe-horned concept at work here. But I wondered at first if Moshinsky hadn’t gone too far in pursuit of that relentless focus: certainly, he seemed unsure of what to do with the chorus apart from march them on and off, performing sloppily synchronised gestures as they sang. Macabre video projections by Stanley Orwin-Fraser (otherwise unseen, except briefly during one of the witches’ early scenes) swirled all over Macbeth’s Act Three visions, as if someone had suddenly remembered Verdi’s comment about the fantastical.Still, none of this mattered alongside two volcanic central performances by Stephen Gadd (Macbeth, pictured above) and Kate Ladner (Lady Macbeth, pictured below left). Their pairing – along with Stephen Barlow’s taut, atmospheric conducting – carried the whole performance. Macbeth is sometimes called Verdi’s “anti-bel canto” opera (especially in this original version), though these two had no problem pouring out long, ardent lines. But neither, crucially, was afraid to put their voice at the service of the drama: Gadd beginning with a washed out sound that grew in heroism and power as the drama unfolded, consistent with his portrayal of a Macbeth who spends much of the opera accepting his terrible destiny before facing it with fearless resolve.Ladner ranged from sibillant hisses and low, curdled asides to terrifying, hawk-like shrieks, all the while projecting a sensuality which made it hard to take your eyes off her while she was on stage. Her sleepwalking scene was a masterclass in tight, luminous vocal control; Gadd’s grief at her demise was painfully raw. This was a believably devoted couple for whom - by the end – you felt a disturbing degree of empathy. Against Gadd’s dark vocal grandeur it was a smart bit of casting to set the softer-edged singing of Oleg Tsibulko as Banquo. Jung Soo Yun’s sweet toned Macduff won a deserved ovation, and as Malcolm, Luke Sinclair addressed his followers from a stageside box. But this was Gadd and Ladner’s show, and taken overall, as a means of concentrating the entire drama on their relationship, the austerity of Moshinsky’s vision worked well. Where it counts, this Macbeth is gripping.  Coming the night after Macbeth, Britten’s Albert Herring felt, if not like undiluted sunshine, then definitely a refreshing spring shower. The only hint of thunder (since we know that nothing really bad is going to happen to Albert) comes in the downpour which, at the beginning of Act Two in Francis Matthews’s production, threatens to rain off the Loxford May Day celebrations. But that actually fits quite neatly with the hints of John Piper in Adrian Linford’s bright, just-naturalistic-enough designs. It’s hard to imagine any production of Albert Herring that strays too far from its original time and setting, but Matthews and Linford place it somewhere around the year of its premiere, 1947, with enough trestle tables and R White’s Lemonade adverts to evoke that Make-do-and-Mend era, plus a civic feast straight out of Enid Blyton (when was the last time you saw, let alone ate, a pink blancmange)?But that’s just the centre of a whole network of 1940s-inspired cultural references, most notably the addition of a non-speaking figure described as “The Stranger” (Simeon John-Wake), whose trilby, sharp suit and insinuating smile mark him out as a distinctly Transatlantic tempter amidst the homely pullovers and cardigans of rural Suffolk. His role seems to be to ensure that Bradley Smith’s bespectacled Prufrock of an Albert (pictured above) very definitely eats that peach – and to partner him in a sort of Rodgers and Hammerstein dream ballet during Act Two’s shimmering orchestral interlude. It’s a strange, transformative sequence, and it casts a spell over the whole piece. To read some commentaries on Albert Herring, you’d think it was a sociology textbook caricature of English rural society (and knowing what a snob Britten was, you’d expect the worst). In fact, with help from Eric Crozier's libretto, generosity of spirit triumphs, and this vividly realised little world becomes something universal. Matthews’s flashes of fantasy lift the whole thing into the realm of Powell and Pressburger.Meanwhile, we don’t miss a single delicious detail. A near-ideal ensemble cast plays affectionately off each other, supported in the pit (as for Macbeth) by a Northern Chamber Orchestra who sounded, under conductor Justin Doyle, like they were enjoying every note – fresh, boisterous, and keenly alert to Britten’s constantly-shifting colours, whether the grumbling bass line beneath Superintendant Budd (John Malloy)’s police report, or the comically sensuous quote from Tristan und Isolde as Sid (Morgan Pearse, whose urbane light baritone was a nice match for the easy confidence with which he carried himself on stage) spikes Albert’s lemonade with rum. As Nancy, the warmth of Kathryn Rudge’s singing belied her peroxide blonde, village bombshell appearance; it was hard, too, to forget the anguish of Heather Shipp as Albert’s mollycoddling mother. These touches of characterisation helped make the final resolution a bracing splash of cold water, rather than a pat moral to the tale.By that point, a dishevelled but beaming Albert is a new man, and it was an impressive feature of Bradley Smith’s performance that the earnest young lad of the earlier scenes was still plausibly the same character. Smith’s clear, conversational tenor projected an integrity that made his confusion touching and his final transformation wholly life affirming. But it’s hard to pick out individual performances. From Yvonne Howard (pictured above left, with Bradley Smith), bringing a touch of the valkyrie to Lady Billows and Lucy Schaufer as her minion Florence, puffing herself up vocally in emulation of her mistress’s manner; to the genteelly squiffy schoolmarm (Mary Hegarty) and her three brilliantly heartless, sausage roll-filching pupils (Sophie Gallagher, Nicholas Challier - whose voice was provided offstage on this occasion by Charlotte Trepess - and Bonnie Callaghan: pure Just William), this was a team effort, audibly enjoyed by a Buxton crowd for whom it may have struck particularly close to home (we drove through at least two aspiring Best Kept Villages on the road up through Staffordshire). In other circumstances, it’d probably get a long run and a good few revivals.If Harry Silverstein’s staging of Mozart’s Lucio Silla fell flat by comparison, that’s not entirely the fault of the production. Although this 1772 Milan carnival commission contains just enough inspiration to lift it out of the “impressive for a 16 year old” category, it’s very telling that the adult Mozart never touched opera seria unless he was paid a great deal of money to do so - and that the Buxton audience (through no fault of the performers) laughed openly at the drama’s supposedly edifying final twist. The challenge for a modern director of opera seria is to find a replacement for whatever it was, beyond the music, that 18th century audiences found compelling in these heavily stylised, frequently static dramas.And for any solution, finding a convincing visual language is vital. In that respect, Silverstein isn’t the first to fail, though he wasn’t helped by sets which (if you wanted to be uncharitable) looked like they might have been all that designer Linda Buchanan could afford once Macbeth and Herring had got first dibs on the Festival budget. Bare scaffolding frameworks were lit in lurid washes of blue and pink, and draped (at least until Joshua Ellicott as Silla tore them off in a tantrum) in tatty bits of plastic sheeting. A spotlight trailed the characters erratically around the stage. Costumes, meanwhile, varied from Ruritanian military uniforms to what I’m informed were 1980s party dresses. Madeleine Pierard managed to bring a desperate heroism to the castrato role of Cecilio while dressed in turn up jeans and a hoodie.The visual incoherence and lack of atmosphere might have been survivable if the drama had ignited. There were some fascinating individual performances, as well as energetic (if occasionally raw) support from Laurence Cummings and The English Concert in the pit. Karolina Plicková (Cinna, a trouser role - pictured above left with Fflur Wyn) carried herself with a persuasively masculine swagger, and as Celia the sunlight that radiated from Fflur Wyn’s singing lit up the stage – as it always does. Rebecca Bottone, as Silla’s unwilling lust-object Giunia compensated for slightly strained coloratura with a commanding, stricken stage presence, finding a piercing emotional intensity in her Act Three aria Fra i pensir – one of the score’s verifiable moments of 24 carat genius. Pierard, as her husband, achieved a comparable focus and a haunting poignancy in another, Act Two’s Ah se a morir, and when the pair shared a scene you were briefly aware of what was missing elsewhere: a sense of human connection.Silverstein just didn’t seem to have many ideas about what to do with his characters during the later stretches of their sometimes overlong arias (even a 16 year old Mozart is still only a 16 year old). Too often, he simply left them striding back and forth in that big, empty, ugly space while the other cast members stood around like lemons. It felt like a very long evening – and that’s not something you ever want to say about Mozart.Still, you can’t win ‘em all, and two out of three is a strike rate that some of our permanent national companies might envy. This ambitious Peak District festival, in its gorgeous little Frank Matcham theatre, remains one of the UK’s most consistently rewarding operatic summer treats: worth seeing, and unquestionably worth going to see.  ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/buxton-festival-review-early-verdi-earlier-mozart-and-refreshing-britten,4
107,"BambinO / Last And First Men, Manchester International Festival",BambinO / Last And First Men,Manchester International Festival,2017-07-07,Robert Beale,"The Manchester International Festival – a biennale of new creative work – this year has a new artistic director in John McGrath, and there’s no large-scale new opera or prominent ""classical"" work, it would seem, other than Raymond Yiu’s song cycle, The World Was Once All Miracle, performed on Tuesday by Roderick Williams with the BBC Philharmonic. But the BBC Philharmonic also teamed up with Icelandic composer-photographer-creator Jóhann Jóhannsson for an ambitious premiere at the Bridgewater Hall, Last And First Men, that McGrath clearly sees as one of the festival’s most substantial offerings.Meanwhile Scottish Opera, its composer-in-residence Lliam Paterson and director Phelim McDermott of theatre company Improbable, have brought BambinO, a new ""opera for babies"", running at various venues in Greater Manchester throughout the festival.I saw it on its day out in Wigan. It’s a remarkably successful concept, as the 14 babies present with their mums and dads – adults usually have to bring a baby to be admitted, and I was one of few allowed to join them as observers – were absorbed from the gentle beginning, in which cellist Laura Sergeant and percussionist Stuart Semple joined solo singers Charlotte Hoather (pictured left) and Timothy Connor to invite them into a world of music, colour and imagination. At start and finish they make a vocal quartet along with instrumental sounds and birdsong effects, and by the end the babies are part of the show, as they pick up and examine the soft-toy bird models that create their own sound, too.The piece has a traditional structure, with two acts and an ""intermission"" of alternative noises, and a story of mummy bird brooding on an egg which turns into another bird and finally flies away to make his own life in the world. It’s sung in Italian, mostly, which works because the words don’t matter – it’s the melodies, and the sounds of classically-trained voices used with mime and costume, that entrance.The score is full of pastiche, incidentally, which is no criticism as it’s cleverly done and even takes a leaf from Mozart’s book when it comes to bird-like duetting – and the whole feel and presentation are those of 18th century music theatre, which when you think about it was probably the last period, Britten and Messiaen excepted, in which birdsong and art music were considered compatible aural experiences. So full marks to BambinO. Opera can work for babies, and maybe one day they’ll come to enjoy it as adults, too.Back to Last And First Men. It was a multi-media show, with black and white movie film, pre-recorded narration (by Tilda Swinton), lighting effects (Stuart Bailes) and a music score which is part electronic, part live orchestra – Jóhannsson himself (pictured below by Jonathan Greetarson) performed with it on electronic organ – plus two soprano soloists, Else Torp and Kate Macoboy, all conducted by Daníel Bjarnason.The film is haunting: it shows eerie shots of the strange, massive, abstract war memorials Tito had built in his power state Yugoslavia after the Second World War. There are just decaying monuments and empty sky – as if we have stumbled on the last relics of a lost mighty community apparently alien to ourselves. The narration makes it clear: we hear from Olaf Stapledon’s 1930 work of science futurism, Last And First Men, coming to us as a voice from 2,000 million years in the future when mankind has evolved to an 18th and last form and is living on Neptune, his sole refuge in the over-heating Solar System. And even there he knows that he is doomed.It was as much a think-piece as a musical one. Indeed, the music score on its own would seem slow-moving and monotonous in the extreme, with multiple doublings of essentially bare textures. The important thing is that it joins with the film, the text, the lighting (and there are times when one or the other takes a rest and the remainder hold attention), to make its point. As Beecham more or less said, it’s not music people love, it’s the noise it makes. This audience loved it, as much as the babies loved BambinO.@RobertBealeMcr",https://theartsdesk.com/new-music-opera/bambino-last-and-first-men-manchester-international-festival,4
108,"Die Walküre, Grange Park Opera review - imaginative and intelligent",Die Walküre,Grange Park Opera,2017-06-30,Gavin Dixon,"Grange Park Opera is aiming big. The company is in a new venue, the grounds of West Horsley Place in Surrey, where they have built themselves a spectacular new opera house in less than a year. The building is not yet complete, but is close enough to stage a full summer season, including this new production of Die Walküre, the second opera of Wagner’s Ring cycle. The opera is a major undertaking for any company, but Grange Park has taken it in its stride, presenting an imaginative and intelligent staging, and to high musical standards, not least from the almost uniformly fine cast.It’s a single-set affair – a large balconied room of a stately home. But set designer Jamie Vartan and lighting designer David Plater create so much variety that it is easy to forget that there are only minimal prop changes between the acts. Director Stephen Medcalf focuses on the narcissism, even sadism, that leads Hunding to exploit Sieglinde, and Wotan to exploit Brünnhilde, the connection apparent in the shared visual style between the first two acts. Medcalf is comfortable with the incongruity of Hunding’s home in the first act becoming Wotan’s in the second. Both are collectors, Hunding a Victorian naturalist, his home filled with glass cabinets of stuffed animals, Wotan of military regalia. Even the sword Nothung sits in a glass display case, and of course Sieglinde and Brünnhilde are similarly treated as trophies.Medcalf adds a mute subplot, a relationship between the butler and a chambermaid, again mirroring the two abusive relationships. If you don’t like that sort of directorial addition, you can usually ignore it, but not here. In the second act it descends into graphic sexual violence, enacted in the background as Wotan sings. Callous? Perhaps, but it works perfectly as the focal point for Medcalf’s interpretation; it is very difficult to see Wotan as the hero here.All these ideas are secondary to the sheer theatricality of the staging, and the greatest strength of the production is the Personenregie, Medcalf continually drawing imaginative, often counterintuitive, reactions from the characters. The chemistry between the Siegmund and Sieglinde in Act I isn’t easy to express, but here the gradual emergence of their love is palpable. Similarly with the gradual acceptance of Brünnhilde’s fate in the finale, expressed to us with increasing certainty through the hardening interactions between her and Wotan. But the uncertainty of individual characters is even more compelling. The Annunciation of Death scene in Act II is a highlight, with Brünnhilde initially uncertain and reluctant to do her duty, and Siegmund similarly divided, although the moment of his resolve is sharply defined.The standout performance in Act I is from Claire Rutter as Sieglinde. Her tone is pure and clear, and her German articulation impeccable. Bryan Register, as Siegmund (main picture), seems to hold back initially, but his vocal prowess soon becomes clear. Wälse! Wälse! Wo ist dein Schwert? was sensational, and the finale of Act I makes a similar impact. Alan Ewing is bassy and forceful, although there was a curious nasal quality to his tone, perhaps the result of a head cold. A shame, because his portrayal of the patient but vengeful Hunding is dramatically ideal.Act II takes place around a huge circular table, with Wotan the Lord of the Manor and Fricka an upright and pompous visiting Victorian lady, bustle and all. The dynamic between Thomas Hall’s Wotan and Sara Fulgoni’s Fricka (both pictured right) is excellent, Wotan attempting to play down the Wälse affair, as if it was simply a business matter, while Fricka continually insists on the moral implications. Hall is a lean figure, and his voice is not huge, but he has the ideal stage presence for the role, and his portrayal of Wotan is the key note of this production – strong and authoritative, but fatally compromised in every situation. Fulgoni is similarly compelling as Fricka, although a little less clear in articulation.The second half of Die Walküre relies mostly on Wotan and Brünnhilde, and the combination of the Thomas Hall and Jane Dutton again proves close to ideal. Dutton isn’t on the very highest rank of Wagnerian voices, but she is more than proficient, and her acting is superlative. She has all the top notes, although they don’t always sound natural, and her voice audibly tired in the last act. A shout-out, too, for Brünnhilde’s fellow Valkyries. At the opening of Act III, they are presented as yet more specimens in Wotan’s collection, each on display in a glass cabinet, before coming to life for a menacing war dance – all attired in Prussian military uniform, pointy helmets and all. The ensemble is in fine vocal form, their Hojotohos ringing around the small auditorium.The Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra copes well with the huge demands of Wagner’s score. The woodwind soloists shone, particularly the bass clarinet. The brass occasionally sounded stretched, especially the horns in the first act, and the lower brass could do with a little more weight. Conductor Stephen Barlow leads a patient but suitably dramatic and fluid musical interpretation. He gives plenty of space to the singers, and paces the music to the action. So the quiet pedal points are often daringly extended to allow time for the stage action, while all the set pieces – the Act I finale, the Ride of the Valkyries – are properly driven for full dramatic impact.This Walküre follows a well-received Tristan und Isolde, which was in the company’s repertoire at its previous home until last year. When that was first unveiled, in 2011, there was talk from the management of a Ring cycle, or at least several instalments. This new production augers well for the company’s Wagnerian ambitions, which no doubt will continue apace when their own Valhalla is complete.@saquabote",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/die-walk%C3%BCre-grange-park-opera-review-imaginative-and-intelligent,5
109,"Ariadne auf Naxos, Glyndebourne review – seriously compelling revival",Ariadne auf Naxos,Glyndebourne  – seriously compelling revival,2017-06-27,Peter Quantrill,"It’s often said that Ariadne auf Naxos is all about The Composer – not only Richard Strauss but an affectionate parody of his younger self – and Katharina Thoma takes this idea seriously in her Glyndebourne production. In the role, Angela Brower plays an important if silent part in the Opera proper, and brings an upbeat flourish to an absorbing if rather pensive reflection on this uncategorisable piece of theatre.Part spoken play, part tragedy, part commedia dell’arte, Ariadne is 100 percent meta-opera. From the outset, place and time are established so firmly – wartime Glyndebourne – that it takes a few minutes to get over the cast singing and speaking in German, as apparently it did when the production was first staged in 2013. If this indicates a strategy of disconcertion – and why not? – it sits uneasily with the homespun feel of the stagecraft in the Prologue. Sir George Christie would surely raise an eyebrow at the supernumeraries milling around a rather drab recreation of his front room. This part of the evening, at least, should be funny; perhaps the pacing will tighten and the payoff lines will zing during the run.There are some very damaged people on stage when the curtain opens on the Opera proper to reveal the old house become a hospital. The patients make an unlikely jumble of shellshocked squaddies and depressed luvvies recovering from the cataclysm which brought the Prologue to end in flames. This is Glynditz, the (mostly) affectionate trade nickname for the old place, where leaving is more of a challenge than arriving. There is a point well made, of opera as a therapeutic space, not only for its audience but its actors. You don’t have to be mad to work here, the production seems to say, but it helps.Directing the revival of her own production, Thoma exploits the gifts and talents of four principals who are also new to Glyndebourne. Brower plays The Composer straight, less neurotic than many predecessors in the role, taking all the few opportunities available to her for warm and not only urgently lyrical flourishes. The stage is held by Lise Davidsen in the title role as a convincingly young woman, dumped and in despair: quite a contrast to the washed-up diva guyed so mercilessly by Christof Loy in his Royal Opera staging.Davidsen (pictured right) plays on her statuesque presence in the Prologue, but she fills the entire house in the Opera with a thrilling if sometimes steel-tipped soprano. Scarcely less impressive are the tenor AJ Glueckert, full of Heldentenor sap as her late-arriving redeemer, Bacchus; and Erin Morley, playing Zerbinetta not as a nemesis but the yang to Ariadne’s yin: it takes real courage to sing her set-piece as a mad scene out of Bellini, and not just for laughs. Supporting roles are well cast: as the Music Master, Sir Thomas Allen does what he can to whip the Prologue into shape, and Hyesang Park (Naiad), Avery Amereau (Dryad) and Ruzan Mantashyan (Echo) make a strong and beguiling trio of companions to Ariadne.Also making his Glyndebourne debut, Cornelius Meister directs the London Philharmonic in an account of greater clarity than wit, rhythmically a little stiff in the Prologue and beset by a few glitches of coordination in the comic ensembles of the Opera. Once it’s run in, the show will be well worth seeing by anyone who doesn’t think they already know what this elusive piece is really ""about"" – and for Davidsen, who should not be short of future engagements.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/ariadne-auf-naxos-glyndebourne-review-%E2%80%93-seriously-compelling-revival,4
110,"Mitridate, Re di Ponto, Royal Opera review - Crowe and costumes light up pointless revival",Mitridate,Re di Ponto,2017-06-27,David Nice,"Why stage a stiff opera about half-frozen royals by a not-yet-divine Mozartino? The best Mitridate really deserves is one of those intimate concert performances with brilliant young singers at which Ian Page's Classical Opera excels. Yet this is the third revival of a 1991 Royal Opera production by Graham Vick, never among his more probing psychological studies (which in any case the 14-year old Mozart, impressive but no teenage genius here, hardly deserves). The best in show is Paul Brown's colourful if restrictive costuming, and this latest cast looked very promising on paper. The actual results aren’t enough.Only that effervescent soprano Lucy Crowe (pictured below) is fully stylish. She plays the “other” lady in the flimsy drama, the one who isn’t fought over by King Mitridate and his two sons, Farnace and Sifare (the brother the love-object in question, Aspasia, really loves). And if Crowe’s Ismene seems to get the best music, that may be due to the force of her personality – though I’d wager that her pretty slow minuet at the beginning of the third act is the only aria that comes close to the future Mozart of at-one-with-the-world gracefulness. She also wears the one costume I’d covet and carries out her Indian Kathak dance movements with real charm. The rest are good in parts. Albina Shagimuratova and Salome Jicia boast brilliant upper registers but need to develop their chest voices if they’re to be heard lower down. They’re not always at one with the orchestra under sprightly Christophe Rousset, though whether that’s his fault or theirs is hard to say. Countertenor Bejun Mehta (pictured below with Jicia) as the villainous brother who repents cuts a vocal dash to begin with, but all personality evaporates in his long and tedious final aria: no master of pace or substance at 14, Mozart cripples the last act with two such bog-wades, and even the big number claimed to be the best in the opera by virtue of its horn obbligato is generic. If there are any other flashes of things to come, they appear in the accompanied recitatives and the inner lining of Aspasia’s second aria, though that’s pushing it a bit.Michael Spyres, so good in Massenet and Berlioz recently, closes up his burnished tenor in the stratosphere as rampaging Mitridate; fellow tenor Rupert Charlesworth, a last-minute replacement for Andrew Tortise as Roman Marzio, is more consistent up there in the surprise aria he gets at the last minute, and very stylish in his coloratura, but even he shows signs of strain (maybe it would help if the orchestra were playing at authentic pitch). Beefing up king and tribune with camp movement groups might work if their execution were a little more polished. Brown’s overall look fails to cohere, much like the work as a whole. If you’re a fan of any of the singers, go along, but don’t expect anything close to a great opera.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/mitridate-re-di-ponto-royal-opera-review-crowe-and-costumes-light-pointless-revival,2
111,"Albert Herring, The Grange Festival review - playing it straight yields classic comedy gold",Albert Herring,The Grange Festival,2017-06-26,David Nice,"Perfect comedies for the country-house opera scene? Mozart's Figaro and Così, Strauss's Ariadne - and Britten's Albert Herring, now 70 years and a few days old, but as ageless as the rest. With the passing of time it's ever more obvious that this satire of provincial East Anglian tricks and manners also has universal appeal and stands with the best. Eric Crozier was surely Britten's finest librettist once Auden stepped aside after Paul Bunyan, his Da Ponte or Hofmannsthal. The sharp wit of text and music needs absolute focus and playing it as straight as possible. It got both from a splendid ensemble under John Copley - wisely not messing with the work already done by composer and librettist on sense of place and character, offering only a slight update from the original 1900 - and of another veteran who knew Britten and Pears well, Steuart Bedford, in the pit.What extraordinary work from the Aurora Orchestra: from the vivid acidic bustling of Florence Pike, housekeeeper to Loxford eminence Lady Billows, you'd think a full symphony orchestra was at work, not just the 13 chamber-opera players. I'm reminded of tenor Ben Johnson who, when asked on the radio if Britten wrote especially well for the tenor voice, responded that he wrote superbly for all voices and all instruments. The harp alone seems to do the work of three or four; the woodwind enhance the Shakespearean pathos of the later scenes, especially when Britten writes his first ghostly operatic duet for alto flute and bass clarinet.In perfect synch with their instrumental colleagues throughout, the singers are both magnificent soloists and - again as becomes especially apparent in Act 3 - team players. Richard Pinkstone gives us a different, and utterly credible, take on shop-boy Albert, the good boy voted May King since all the village girls are, in the words of the chief moralist, ""not virgins but trollops"". Tied to his widowed mum's apron strings but clearly strong enough to break loose from the first, this Albert has the operatic-tenor heft for the will to freedom in the voice from his very first scene, rather than the usual softer grain of the lyric-character choral scholar. The emancipation sees him very much in control (pictured above with Kitty Whately and Adrian Thompson); again, it's completely believable.Around him the standard-bearers of provincial propriety lurk vulture-like, but even though they're types, we've all met them - even Orla Boylan's incredible transformation from a candid Tatyana and Sieglinde of yore into dragon dowager (pictured below) splendidly observed in the askance disapproval with which she views all and sundry and the constant distracted fiddling at the fete: part Dame Edna, part Geraldine James's Lady Maud in Blott on the Landscape, but never overplaying it and unleashing all her dramatic-soprano power when she needs it. Her accomplices include Clarissa Meek's gaunt Miss Pike - another classy lesson in letting the music and the words do a lot of the work - the toothy-radiant Miss Wordsworth of Anna Gillingham, very funny in the fete rehearsal with her pupils (Jack Stone, Emily Vine and Catriona Hewitson) and the clarion pomposity of Adrian Thompson's Mayor. Andri Björn Róbertsson's slow-witted Plod and Kathleen Wilkinson's Mum don't play it for laughs, but the show is none the worse for that.Britten's parodies are always done with love and respect, so that they can end up being surprisingly moving - in the first place, the Reverend Gedge's homily on virtue, radiantly sung by Alexander Robin-Baker. Vocally, he's a more virile baritone than the more sensitive Timothy Nelson, a rather Liederish butcher's lad Sid in his first scene, but Nelson looks the part and is charmingly paired with the inimitable Kitty Whately as the pretty-compassionate Nancy (pictured below). Her Act Three aria of repentance, punctuated by rondo-like reappearances of the music for the hunt of the missing Albert, kicks off a final chain of surprisingly deep set pieces, culminating in the remarkable Passacaglia where all the adults bar the putatively dead one sing about mortality in a queasy mix of pathos and bathos (again, Mozart and Da Ponte couldn't have done it better).The fun of the fete to crown the one true virgin works as brilliantly as ever in Copley's skilful staging and the perfect designs of Tim Reed, Prue Handley and Kevin Treacy, whose lighting effects a storm-brewing sunset transition to the poignant nocturne of the following scene. There's a lot of manoeuvring of realistic stage sets - presumably by the resident Grange chorus, wordless in this opera - but it's done smoothly so as not to mess with the superb instrumental interludes.An evening of unalloyed pleasure, then, all the better for the comfortable seats with bags of leg room in the theatre - Grange Park's previous incumbents had taken all the extant fittings away - and the opening up of the view down to the lake, with fresh possibilities of walking to it. The only blot on the landscape is the champagne-bar extension blocking a view of the house's neoclassical portico. On the evidence of my first visit to the ""new"" Grange, though, artistic standards are at the highest level; this is the best show I've seen there since the daring shot at Prokofiev's The Gambler a decade ago, and a comic complement to the equally superlative Death in Venice at Garsington, also conducted by Bedford.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/albert-herring-grange-festival-review-playing-it-straight-yields-classic-comedy-gold,5
112,"Fidelio, Longborough Festival review - death to the concept of concepts",Fidelio,Longborough Festival,2017-06-26,stephen Walsh,"Opera directors must, I suppose, direct. But one could wish that they kept their mouths shut, at least outside the rehearsal studio. The condescension in Longborough’s programme-book interview with the director (Orpha Phelan) and designer (Madeleine Boyd) of the festival’s new Fidelio beggars belief. And when the curtain goes up, or to be exact, when you enter the theatre and are confronted with the usual “back story” of a production line of white clad, masked hospital technicians packing drugs, filling syringes, and then – unbelievably – playing eurhythmics in time with Beethoven’s Overture, you may well find yourself wishing a speedy death (by injection?) to the whole concept of concepts.The Phelan-Boyd idea, for what it’s worth, seems to be that the inmates of Don Pizarro’s gaol are kept there, not by bars, but by drugs. The fact that this makes nonsense of the wonderful Prisoners’ Chorus, which is all about freedom and release, is simply bad luck, and hardly matters anyway, since this great moment is presented upstage behind a laboratory clutter of tables, bottles etc and almost wholly misses its effect, despite excellent singing by the chorus and by the (uncredited) solo tenor.“Prisons are never dark,” Boyd also informs us, having presumably overlooked Florestan’s first line, “Gott! welch’ Dunkel hier!”, which luckily Orpha Phelan has noticed and sets in a suitably opaque gloom, visually the best part of the production (lighting by Wayne Dowdeswell). But the inevitable updating (to make sure we, the poor blockheaded audience, pick up the relevance of political prisoners to our own enlightened times) runs to having Pizarro in a wheel chair, the victim of a credit-sequence shooting by someone or other, perhaps Florestan (whose imprisonment might then seem justified), and Florestan painstakingly revived by eurhythmic CPR through much of the final scene.The real problem with all this nonsense is that, when it comes to actually directing the opera as a musical drama, Phelan flounders. Fidelio is a work of sublime moments, as she reminds us, but it is not without its dramaturgical problems. These are not much helped by singing the opera in German but speaking the (rewritten) dialogue in English.But above all they are not helped by the failure to enact the personal drama that is embodied in moments like the grave-digging scene, where Leonora has to be seen to help Rocco dig while simultaneously agonizing over the apparently lifeless corpse that might be her husband. Phelan’s direction here is limp and unfocused; and the stage business in the final scene – the CPR, followed by the still semi-conscious Florestan having his trousers ostentatiously changed by prison warders – suggests yet again the directorial fear that music, even Beethoven’s, can’t be trusted to hold the audience’s attention on its own. This is where directing opera actually gets difficult: a problem not of concepts but of sheer musicality.So what of the music? It’s a solid rather than memorable affair under the Franco-Israeli Gad Kadosh, on the quick side and not always quite secure in ensemble. Elizabeth Atherton (pictured right with John Paul Huckle) sings stylishly as Leonora and handles the male “disguise” (actually green unisex overalls) as well as most, but she is not quite a Leonora vocally, lacking the ideal weight of voice, and perhaps reflecting Boyd’s penetratingly up-to-the-minute observation about “these modern times, when people don’t have to identify themselves so much as male/female”. Adrian Dwyer, by contrast, has the right Florestan sound, and is mostly very good in the aria, if inclined to thin out his tone at the top. But Simon Thorpe is a disappointing Pizarro, scarcely dark enough in timbre, perhaps more baritone than bass. Maybe he’d be happier standing up.The most apt performance vocally is John Paul Huckle’s Rocco, sturdy in phrasing and colour, and a good image of the well-meaning but morally fragile common man. His American accent is slightly disconcerting in the dialogue, not least because of the modish (uncredited) translation. But his relative youth works well. His job calls for strength, not wit or wisdom. Lucy Hall is a lively, secretarial Marzelline, until she literally lets her hair down and removes her specs at the thought of marrying Fidelio. Sam Furness is a suitably direct Jacquino, a bit of a vocal bully, an old-fashioned male. On the other hand Timothy Dawkins’s well-sung Minister – here for some reason promoted, or demoted, to Colonel – is a very modern male, a soldier in government. But wait! What about Napoleon?",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/fidelio-longborough-festival-review-death-concept-concepts,2
113,"Otello, Royal Opera review — Kaufmann makes a pretty Moor",Otello,Royal Opera  — Kaufmann makes a pretty Moor,2017-06-22,ismene Brown,"Recorded on disc, this cast would be extraordinary for much of the time — to look at, not so much. Royal Opera conductor Antonio Pappano lured Jonas Kaufmann to London for his first attempt on the Everest of tenor roles, and with so many recent uncertainties about his vocal condition, last night the German took his debut cautiously but beautifully — his astonishing good looks enhanced with a spritz of  Mediterranean bronzing rather than the full-on Moorish blackening of yesteryear.The flattering look dilutes the dramatic effect, however. Less perfection needed. For you need to suspend much disbelief to accept Kaufmann (pictured below) as a man so prey to doubt about his sexual appeal to his wife that he kills her simply because of an insinuation that another man flirted with her. He is by unfair advantage a glorious man, up there with Roger Federer and Cary Grant, and masculine vulnerability is not credible in his case without some considerable effort on the director's part.For this Otello to be imprisoned in Keith Warner’s lifeless new production, set inside a chilly black box set, and with all the high emotions staged with perplexing physical awkwardness, does not help breach disbelief. (I noted with pleasure the special brevity to which the costumier had tailored his jerkin over his long, graceful legs.)In fact reasons for this Otello’s lack of self-esteem are hard to see in the production. None of Shakespeare’s suggestions are there — the racial card is minimised to vanishing point, Maria Agresta’s Desdemona is not intimidatingly gorgeous, Marco Vratogna’s bull-headed, shaven Iago is a blatant bad sort and Frédéric Antoun’s delicate Cassio is no threat to anyone.There’s little imaginative stimulus in the setting — this Venetian colony on Cyprus has nothing of Mediterranean light, sea or sensuality, everything being starkly lit and black, with a boxy bench or two, and walls that are prone to move ponderously about. With nowhere to sit or recline, the chief singers must loll or writhe on the floor, trying to sing their high notes while prone, which always costs tone. Poor Desdemona spends a lot of time crawling, kneeling and lying in her big dresses, when it looks ridiculous. Equally ridiculous is the vast white Lion of St Mark statue that trundles across the stage for a few seconds, and is next seen in bits in Otello’s loft.Really, the thing’s a trial to look at, and thoroughly discouraging of the fatally heated ensemble verismo required of Verdi's distilled scenes.But there could be no finer encouragement to the casts than Pappano, who from the first notes whips the Royal Opera House orchestra like Poseidon whipping the seas or Zeus the fates. Three hours whirl by, neatly split by one interval. What a fantastic volume of sound from the Royal Opera chorus in the opening, their stasis making eloquent contrast with the raging of Verdi’s scene-painting. Every word in the libretto seems to be reflected in the composer’s scoring, and Pappano pounces on the sparkles, birds, breezes, and the natural features that the staging chooses to ignore.The moment Kaufmann came ashore, trumpeting success over the Muslims, you heard a man of nobility and courage, though he had to force the volume to ride Pappano’s monster waves of brass. Later performances might show a less hesitant stage commitment to the relationship with Agresta, and to the physical embodying of Otello’s loss of mental control of his jealousy. A Kaufmann-Pappano audio recording soon, please, not video, so that he can exploit his potentially thrilling vocal characterising without the distraction of physically acting it under a bad director.The Italian Agresta (pictured above) is intriguing. Her grainy soprano, with a spreading vibrato, sounded heavy in the first act, yet vanished to almost nothing in her lower register. Still the honesty of her Desdemona grew on me, and became greatly moving in her final scene, singing to her inconsistent vocal limits in a way that was dramatically compelling, haunted in the ""salces"" and achingly sad in the Ave Maria.Vratogna’s Iago (pictured above) is a bit of a mystery in the scheme of what Pappano seems to be indicating. He dominated the stage physically, with a suitably black-hued baritone and brooding predatoriness, but barked out Iago’s part with such violence of timbre and undisguised unpleasantness that the idea of Kaufmann’s well-bred Otello being best mates with him was implausible. Some reining in would benefit all round.Thomas Atkins sounded good as Roderigo, there is a nice slick sword fight in Act 1 choreographed by Ran Arthur Braun, and some of the chorus sopranos sound more wobbly than desirable.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/otello-royal-opera-review-%E2%80%94-kaufmann-makes-pretty-moor,3
114,"Pelléas et Mélisande, Garsington Opera review - brilliant but frustrating",Pelléas et Mélisande,Garsington Opera,2017-06-17,stephen Walsh,"A drama of passion for essentially passive characters, Debussy’s one and only completed opera is a masterpiece of paradox. How do you stage a work whose dramatis personae hardly seem aware of their own destructive feelings, and who inhabit their island world like the blind who, according to Pelléas, used to visit the curative fountain but stopped doing so when the king himself went blind?Michael Boyd, in his beautiful but occasionally frustrating production for Garsington Opera, approaches - if he doesn’t wholly solve – this problem by treating each of the 15 scenes as a kind of static tableau in which the characters often seem incapable of approaching or even looking at each other. “Don’t touch me” are Mélisande’s first words to Golaud, and still in the penultimate scene the adoring Pelléas admits, “I have not yet dared look her in the eye.”At the same time Boyd cleverly animates the drama by linking the rat-tat-tat of short scenes with action not envisaged by either the composer or the author of the original play, Maurice Maeterlinck, but necessitated by the lengthy interludes Debussy extended at short notice to cover the scene changes. Golaud’s son Yniold appears first in Act 3 of the score, but is here present from the start, on Golaud’s or Mélisande’s arm, playing ball with the moon, and even rescuing Mélisande’s crown from the well into which we have, no less uncanonically, watched her drop it during the prelude.No scene changes here. Everything takes place in a single fixed set (designer Tom Piper, lighting by Malcolm Rippeth) that resembles nothing so much as the grand salon of a sunken liner, all blue and gold, with staircases right, left and centre, an apparently floating balcony, various dark corners, and a general air of submarine decay. Whatever else one might say about the performance, it’s stunningly watchable. Boyd’s dramaturgy is like a film: for instance, entering the dungeon Golaud and Pelléas descend a rickety staircase from high on the left, but later re-emerge at stage level centre, implying a shifting space far larger than the visible frame. The forest becomes the castle hall, the castle becomes the cave. The whole of Allemonde – an island nowhere – is crammed into this moribund salon of misunderstood and barely even recognised emotion.But while Boyd’s characters freeze or stand helpless, the Philharmonia Orchestra under Jac van Steen leave us in no doubt about the brooding, sometimes raging passions they’re unable to express. This is a brilliant, uninhibited reading of Debussy’s not entirely restrained score. While Golaud gives a few cursory tugs at Mélisande’s hair after catching her in flagrante delictu with Pelléas on the balcony, the orchestra swirls and heaves his repressed violence; and while the lovers declare their passion at 20 paces in the penultimate scene, van Steen and co. itemise their true desires. The playing throughout is superb.Like Wagner, Debussy reveals almost everything in the orchestra. But the singers also need attention, and though van Steen coordinates this rich and complex music – stage and pit – without a hitch, there are times when one would like to hear a little more of the voices. Only Paul Gay’s perhaps too aged Golaud (he has, after all the same mother as the youthful Pelléas), and Brian Bannatyne-Scott’s Arkel ride the orchestra dependably. William Davies does his overtime as Yniold with an expertise beyond his years, but often comes off second best in terms of balance. Susan Bickley is a warm, comforting Geneviève, also more in evidence than the score implies, and none the worse for that.At the focus of it all, Andrea Carroll and Jonathan McGovern (pictured above) look and sound well enough, but suffer somewhat from the restraint imposed on them by the production. Carroll, a dark-haired, mezzoish Mélisande, is good at the poised and mysterious but lacks consistent intensity. McGovern, a high baritone Pelléas in plain shirt and trousers (he has sung Papageno and Purcell’s Aeneas, but also Monteverdi’s Orfeo) likewise sings with great polish but never quite convinces that love is a case of kill or be killed.Any Pelléas as beautiful and musically accomplished as this will intrigue and fascinate like few other operas. To judge by the audience response, I may be almost alone in also wanting a shade more electricity in the lack of communication.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/pell%C3%A9as-et-m%C3%A9lisande-garsington-opera-review-brilliant-frustrating,4
115,"Der Rosenkavalier, Welsh National Opera review - hard to imagine a stronger cast",Der Rosenkavalier,Welsh National Opera,2017-06-13,stephen Walsh,"Der Rosenkavalier, you might think, is one of those operas that belong in a specific place and time and no other. “In Vienna,” says Strauss's score, “in the first years of Maria Theresia’s reign” (i.e. the 1740s). But this, of course, is a provocation. For the Welsh National Opera, Olivia Fuchs updates it to, roughly, the date of composition (1910-11), or perhaps even a few years later, to judge from the flickering gunfire, and the heavy emphasis on militarism in the programme. And she supplies the Marschallin with a Doppelgänger in the person of an old lady dressed 1930s/40s, who haunts the stage whenever the Marschallin (aged 32) moans about her age, which is a good deal of the time.Fuchs is a fine stage director and a good stylist. Apart from some anachronisms in the text and a few vulgarities in what publicists would call the sex scenes (Act 1), her version works pretty well. The same plain, panelled set (designer Niki Turner) does well enough for the Marschallin’s bedroom, marginally less well, repainted, for the parvenu Faninal’s palace. The honey trap in the inn springs brilliantly, with noisy, bouncy children, flashing lights, etc.But oh! these Doppelgängers or alter egos, or whatever they are, cluttering the stage and double-underlining ideas that are already laboured in the libretto. Let’s hope directors grow out of them soon. I imagine them all sitting around together in opera directors’ clubs swapping brilliant new concepts like politicians discussing the abolition of student fees, then going off and all doing exactly the same madly innovative and daring thing with Fidelio (Salzburg), Ulysses (Grange), Tristan (Longborough, but thankfully ditched in the revival), and now Rosenkavalier. Away with it all, I say. Back to the text and then by all means invent on that basis. That’s what the musicians are doing, and in Cardiff they do it marvellously.It would be hard to imagine a stronger cast, vocally at least. Rebecca Evans (pictured right) is short of stature for the Marschallin, but she overcomes this with beautiful, elegant Strauss singing worthy of Schwarzkopf or even Lotte Lehmann. The character herself, though revered by Strauss-lovers, is brittle: strong on manners and protocol but morally bankrupt. We aren’t fooled that her one-night stand with Octavian is anything more than a prelude to the latest disappointment. But Evans is so stately in her dismissal of poor, repulsive Ochs, so dignified in her relinquishing of Octavian, that we almost accept her as a tragic figure whose time has come.Lucia Cervoni’s Octavian, similarly, is strong on style, with lovely warm colourings in every register and reasonable command of the difficult art of being a girl pretending to be a boy dressed as a girl, though she is not helped by her trouserless state in the first act, exposing the one exposable aspect of the anatomy that, curiously enough, distinguishes the sexes: leg posture. Louise Alder’s Sophie sparkles from the start, in touchingly exaggerated spontaneity at the thought of marriage to never mind who, then vibrant emotion at the real possibility of Octavian. Her singing, effortlessly lyrical, would surely have sent the composer into raptures. What he would have said about Octavian’s Silver Rose costume – basically a suit of armour – is another matter. But I suppose the Rose-bearer is a kind of soldier, a knight at least, justified in his sword-play with Ochs, and thankfully not, as Fuchs might have made it, gun-play, though the sword is an ornamental one from the mantelpiece, and maybe the armour is as well.Brindley Sherratt’s Ochs, on the other hand, is not quite the usual scruff, but a decayed squire in check trousers and Loden coat. His rustic patter is fluent-sounding (who ever knows what he actually sings or if he sings all of it?), though not heavily accented, and the voice is a strong bass, with a solid low E at the end of Act 2. Adrian Clarke makes the best of Faninal, a character neither sympathetic nor funny, and with nothing very memorable to sing.There are other minor upsets: too much waltzing around by the Valzacchis (Madeleine Shaw and Peter Van Hulle, for some reason got up as a clown), a stylish but underpowered Italian tenor (Paul Charles Clarke). But all is overridden by a classic performance by the orchestra under their new, Czech conductor Tomáš Hanus, evidently a master of the movement and big phrasing of late romantic music. I can’t wait to hear him in Khovanshchina and From The House of the Dead. But no Doppelgängers, please.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/der-rosenkavalier-welsh-national-opera-review-hard-imagine-stronger-cast,4
116,"Hamlet, Glyndebourne review - integrity if not genius in Brett Dean's score",Hamlet,Glyndebourne,2017-06-12,David Nice,"Nature’s germens tumble all together rather readily in more recent operatic Shakespeare. Following the overblown storm before the storm of Reimann’s Lear and the premature angst of Ryan Wigglesworth’s The Winter’s Tale, what's rotten in the state of Denmark rushes to the surface a little too quickly in Brett Dean's bold new take on the most challenging of all the tragedies. This is an impressive labour of love from all concerned at a level which only Glyndebourne at its best can manage, led with supreme authority by conductor Vladimir Jurowski and director Neil Armfield. Yet the score worries itself close to death very soon and, even if the pace, the dynamics and the moods become more varied as a long but never otiose evening progresses, it ultimately falls short of essential pity and terror.There is total integrity, but not genius. For that, perhaps, a more daring paraphrase of Hamlet’s gist would have been necessary. Imagine, for instance, what a filleted Gerald Barry treatment might have made of the existential absurdities (a wacky Soviet production of the 1930s with music by the young Shostakovich suggests a fascinating precedent). Instead, despite the opening “…or not to be” putting the spotlight immediately on Allan Clayton’s charismatic protagonist (pictured below with Kim Begley's Polonius and Rod Gilfry's Claudius), Matthew Jocelyn’s skilful libretto stays faithful to the flabbergasting text and the drama’s trajectory. Sometimes characters purloin others’ lines; there is a metaphysical chorus, and short ensembles, from trios to sextets, that are perhaps the least successful aspect of the writing in their amorphousness.Some of the departures rob us of crucial aspects in the original drama: Hamlet’s father’s ghost sings at the heart-in-mouth moment where the son loses his mother’s belief in his revelation, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern – countertenors Rupert Enticknap and Christopher Lowrey, brilliant – never leave with Hamlet for England, but instead live on to parrot Osric before and during the fatal fencing match. If you’re going to outline all the main events, the sombre break in time outlined by the Prince’s absence seems to me essential.No point, though, in lamenting what’s not there. What is could have been the more vivid if Dean’s setting of the text were more speech-melodic. Despite Clayton’s superb articulation, much of the human music in the soliloquies is lost; for all the whistling strangeness that accompanies the Yorick monologue, its deeper pathos – still reverberating with me from Andrew Scott’s astounding delivery in the recent Almeida production – is lacking. What comes across as strongest in the vocal writing is Claudius’s attempt to pray for his sins, mesmerisingly delivered by Rod Gilfry (though it was surely a mistake to omit his final “My words fly up, my thoughts remain below,” the ironic twist to Hamlet’s scruples in not killing his father’s usurper in his orisons). The ensuing scene with Gertrude might have been musically stronger, too, but Sarah Connolly’s magnificent presence and urgency make it work almost as well as in the play.The real soul is in the orchestra, even if its busy-ness doesn’t always seem closely related to action or thoughts. The pair of clarinets we first hear writhing in a twitchy court scene are phantasmagorical throughout; though the tuba and bass lines for the Ghost are overdone, they serve an impressive purpose. The introduction of an accordion, the wielder of which (the terrific James Crabb) comes onstage with the players (The Murder of Gonzago pictured above, with Sarah Connolly's Gertrude and Rod Gilfry's Claudius looking on), adds a crucial variety to the textures; the auditorium ensembles above left and right make this a work you have to experience in the theatre, especially in the antiphonal side drum rattles. The eight choral voices in the pit add an extra supernatural dimension, too.There are new sonorities after the interval, chiefly in Ophelia’s mad scene – which you may see as gripping music theatre, or Barbara Hannigan doing her usual however superbly (pictured below in an early scene with David Butt Philip's Laertes) – and the encounter with the gravedigger. The indomitable John Tomlinson trebles up as this skull-tosser, Player 1 and Ghost, as in some productions of the play. He makes the most of settings which could be sharper; Jacques Imbrailo as Horatio and Butt Philip’s Laertes have fewer chances, though their presence is undeniable, and it will be fascinating to see what the other young tenor makes of Hamlet on the tour.Armfield, a director of whom we haven’t seen enough in the UK recently, knows exactly how to operate the drama and move the characters around. He does so without mannerism and making full use of Ralph Myers’ malleable set – contrasting open windows with closed shutters, handsome rooms and backstage scenes, so evocatively lit by Jon Clark, and handsomely filled with Alice Babidge’s stylish costumes. The set pieces all work, The Murder of Gonzago in cahoots with the music’s brilliant jolts and pauses, the fencing finale in spite of the fact that here the score doesn’t really build the tension keenly enough.Whether the whole moves you or not – I remained on the outside, though always fascinated – the total work of art cries out to be seen and heard. That’s especially due to the return of Jurowski, the house’s inspirational music director from 2001 to 2013, whose typically meticulous work not just with his magnificent London Philharmonic but also with the singers – he spent a whole day before the premiere making sure the covers were in a state of readiness to go on if necessary – and whose presence at every stage of the production can’t be praised too highly. Every composer needs a conductor like this to realise the ideal.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/hamlet-glyndebourne-review-integrity-if-not-genius-brett-deans-score,4
117,"A Midsummer Night's Dream, Snape Maltings",A Midsummer Night's Dream,Snape Maltings,2017-06-10,alexandra Coghlan,"It’s all there in the first few bars of Britten’s music – that unsettling tension between beauty and familiarity, and eerie, undefinable otherness. Those cello glissandi might end in glowing major chords, but the tentacle-like slides throw them into doubt. We’re no longer in a binary world of major or minor, but a harmonic landscape of infinite possibility. Netia Jones’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream delights visually in shades of grey, a gorgeous shadow-play of a production, but when she drained her designs of colour she also stripped it from the drama, leaving Britten’s opera a wan reflection of its true self.Jones’s signature video projections and animations dominate a production that is less about concept than a more generalised sense of atmosphere and sensation. The imagery draws heavily on the natural world. Spiders, deer, a monkey and a monochrome Eden of flowers and foliage (complete with snake) all bring life to the silhouetted landscape with all the grainy precision of pen-and-ink drawings. It’s a bit too emphatically literal at times but generates some gorgeous stage-pictures.Both Shakespeare’s play and Britten’s opera might revel in the other-worldly trappings of a story that plunges its quartet of lovers into a magical wood, but ultimately both are more interested in human nature, in the jealousies, loves, ambitions and desires that drive everyone, whether man or fairy, to action.So to reduce Oberon (Iestyn Davies, pictured above) and Tytania (Sophie Bevan, pictured below) to a pair of stylised ciphers – he a rigidly immobile Andy Warhol-like figure, complete with bleached hair and blanched face, she a stardust-scattered Gibson Girl – and explore no real relationship between them and their fairy charges (little Victorian schoolboys in top hats, their dark glasses an echo of Oberon’s own) beyond a little predictable violence towards Jack Lansbury’s barefoot urchin Puck, is to hollow the work out. There’s some consolation to be had in the squabbling lovers, but almost none in the Mechanicals whose scenes seem actively to avoid laughs, but without offering anything much (a real-life dog and a bicycle aside) to replace them.But if the direction lacks magic, the cast is every bit the advertised dream. Channelling all the character denied him in his movements into his song, Iestyn Davies makes a steely Oberon, all androgynous beauty and hypnotic control, spinning his melodies like a web. Blooming blowsily rich next to his purity, Sophie Bevan’s Tytania was indecently sensual – not for her the crystalline precision we more often hear in this role. Lovers Nick Pritchard, George Humphreys, Eleanor Dennis (pictured below with Humphreys) and Clare Presland remind us just how much young British vocal talent is currently available, while Clive Bayley’s late cameo as Theseus is a luxurious afterthought.Hampered dramatically by Jones’s understated approach and by an acoustic that muffles all text beyond comprehension, the Mechanicals are at least allowed to flourish musically. Lawrence Wiliford’s ravishing Flute catches the ear, and Matthew Rose’s Bottom is at once the emotional and musical anchor of the production. Chelmford Cathedral’s choristers sing with character and confidence, and Ryan Wigglesworth draws an efficient, if uncomplicated, account of Britten’s score from the Aldeburgh Festival Orchestra.Missing that awkward, indefinable sense of the uncanny, that transformative element both Britten and Shakespeare demand, this Midsummer Night’s Dream might look the business, but its moonlit happenings are ultimately all lantern and thorn-bush.@AlexaCoghlan",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/midsummer-nights-dream-snape-maltings,3
118,"Tristan und Isolde, Longborough Festival",Tristan und Isolde,Longborough Festival,2017-06-09,stephen Walsh,"The Longborough Festival was started, essentially, to perform Wagner, and Wagner is still what it does best. This revival of Carmen Jakobi’s production of Tristan und Isolde is the strongest argument imaginable for small-theatre Wagner. For once the voices can make themselves heard without bellowing; the orchestra is clear and detailed, not just a distant fog; and – a rare treat in opera of any kind – acting with the face as well as the arms and torso becomes a factor in establishing character and relationships.Isolde is a passionate young girl with a manipulative streak. But what Wagnerian soprano ever troubles to convey such mundane intricacies? At Longborough Lee Bissett does so, and with enormous intelligence and conviction. Not only does she sing with power and control, but from the start she creates, through bodily gesture and mobile facial expression, a vivid image of a young woman who is finding it hard to decide whether she hates or is in love with the man who is escorting her to marry the King of Cornwall. And once she has made up her mind, she conveys equally well the rapture and intensity, and the inevitable doom, of the love in question.Peter Wedd (pictured right) is likewise more volatile from the start than the usual impassive, courteous delegate (his initial “Was ist? Isolde?” had one almost jumping out of one’s seat). His is a Tristan palpably on the verge of a forbidden love, and petrified of the fact. Out of this portrait there develops a nearly unbearable intensity in the subsequent acts, an intensity of a kind perhaps only really achievable in an intimate theatre. The second act love duet is almost embarrassing in its proximity, as if one were eavesdropping on something too personal for public display. And Wedd’s third act delirium, magnificently sung, has an immediacy I’ve rarely experienced in this often wearisome monologue.The revival is well worth seeing, if you can cadge a ticket, just for this duo: marvellous character drama as well as great singing. But the cast as a whole has few weaknesses. Harriet Williams is a beautiful, touching Brangaene, a perfect foil to Bissett’s vengeful Isolde of the first act, and lovely offstage from her tower in the love duet; Stuart Pendred repeats his sturdy Kurwenal from the original production. Only Geoffrey Moses’s King Mark disappoints, too elderly-looking even for this aging widower, and inclined to hang below the note. Stephen Rooke (Melot), Sam Furness (Shepherd), and Adam Green (Helmsman) are all excellent.Anthony Negus goes from strength to strength in his mastery of the sweep and scale of Wagner’s discourse, but I’ve heard more reliable playing from this orchestra. There were tentative moments in the prelude, and the hunting horns in Act 2 were maybe a shade too realistically alfresco. But these are teething troubles. Jakobi has mercifully got rid of the dancing doppelgangers and the onstage bass clarinettist of the original production, though I could do without Wedd’s vision of Isolde (new, I think) in the monologue, which weakens the effect of her actual entrance before the Liebestod. Kimie Nakano’s set designs, simple but atmospheric, and exquisitely lit by Ben Ormerod, are a joy as before.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/tristan-und-isolde-longborough-festival-0,5
119,"Radamisto, Guildhall School, Milton Court",Radamisto,Guildhall School,2017-06-06,alexandra Coghlan,"''…after various Accidents, it comes to pass that he recovers both Her and his Kingdom”. Handel's Radamisto may be a tale of warring kingdoms, noble self-sacrifice and mature, wedded love, but it’s also a fairly daft piece of dramatic belief-suspension, whose various knotty conflicts get miraculously untangled in a brisk few bars of recitative, just in time for a rousing final chorus and whatever the ancient Armenian version is of a nice cup of tea.Director John Ramster is well aware of this, embracing the opera’s idiocies along with its musical glories in his witty new production for Guildhall’s students, and giving the opera’s awkward happy ending an unexpectedly plausible motivation in the process.King Tiridate is at war with King Farasmane, whose son Radamisto must do battle to restore his father’s throne and protect his wife Zenobia, whose has caught Tiridate’s eye. To complicate matters further, Tiridate is already married to Polissena, none other than Farasmane’s daughter and Radamisto’s sister. Suffice to say, things get complicated.Louis Carver’s stylish designs (evocatively lit by Jake Wiltshire) place the action in a modern-day museum. Classical Horsemen line the back wall, rearing out of a sprawling bas-relief, while armies of business-formal clad stewards pace up and down in the foreground. Visiting the exhibition space are two warring heads of state, who settle down (rather unwillingly) to watch an operatic take on the gallery’s history. That a classic opera production like Ramster’s should mock the current trend for immersive, site-specific stagings so deftly is surely a sign that directors really do need to find a new gimmick.Within this neat dramatic frame, Ramster’s cast present performances that marry some nice contemporary comedy – plenty of da capo by-play, and a judicious use of a silent ensemble – with consciously old-fashioned costuming (painted-on beards and eyebrows and more headpieces and bangles than an am-dram production of Kismet) and baroque armography. There’s plenty of movement to drive things forwards, which is fortunate given how little impetus comes from Chad Matthias Kelly’s pit.Despite the conductor’s best attempts to galvanise his forces, entries were missed or late, tuning erratic and the opening of arias frankly scary at times. The quality of the solo moments – the nimble violin in Polissena’s “Sposa ingrate”, and the deliciously coaxing oboe for Zenobia’s “Quando ma, spietata sorte” – makes the general muddle even less explicable.The cast coped well with the orchestra’s uncertainties. Jade Moffat’s luscious Zenobia swelled into something really exciting by the end of the evening – a richly upholstered mezzo, with plenty of colour running through it. Hers was a welcome foil to the many sopranos (not a countertenor in sight), led by Joanna Maria Skillett’s impeccable Tigrane – lithe and sparkling in her coloratura – and Elizabeth Skinner’s intermittently thrilling Fraarte.If we could have done with something a bit richer for Radamisto, Chloe Traharne’s bright mezzo did the coloratura business, and Margo Arsane was an efficient Polissena, with a nice line in comedy. Dominick Felix got all the best laughs as unlucky-in-love tyrant Tiridate, and Bertie Watson added some much needed lower-voice heft with his crooning Farasmane.Tied up in a neat bow of a dramatic conclusion (no spoilers here), Ramster’s production offers a lighter take on Handel’s tragicomedy than Christopher Alden’s for ENO, and provides a rare opportunity to hear the first version of a score later embellished with various replacement arias for Handel’s newly-arrived star Senesino. I’m not sure anyone will find it an improvement on the classic version, but as a curiosity it’s well worth seeing.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/radamisto-guildhall-school-milton-court,3
120,"La Rondine, Opera Holland Park",La Rondine,Opera Holland Park,2017-06-02,David Nice,"When are the big international opera houses going to wake up to the great British talent that is Elizabeth Llewellyn? With her opulent soprano – shaded middle register, full bloom at the top, cutting chest voice – she was born to sing Verdi and Puccini, and her stage presence is undeniable from the moment she steps out. English National Opera threw her a few roles – Micaëla, Mimì, Mozart's Countess – but then seemed to pass over her in favour of American sopranos. Now Opera Holland Park has showcased her brilliance in an opera made for a London summer night – Puccini's bittersweet Parisian waltz-dream with operetta-ish overtones, which happens to be a good company show into the bargain.The plot is light as thistledown: courtesan Magda finds true love sharing beers at a dance-hall, hesitates to tell her nice young man about her role in society, leaves him (no real spoiler involved) – Verdi's La traviata revisited in airier mode. OHP has been here before, in a production faithful to the soft Belle Époque decadence of the original setting. Martin Lloyd-Evans almost justifes his update by pulling off the big coup of the evening, with a little help from takis's designs and Martin Howland's lighting: the prim salon with its pretty pastel dresses for the bit-part girls offsetting heroine Magda in bold canary yellow gives way to Bullier's urban, apache raucousness, accommodating our courtesan transformed in leather jacket and jeans (Llewellyn and Matteo Lippi in Act Two pictured below). There's a problem here, though, when Puccini does a Gallic-Italian take on Der Rosenkavalier or Die Fledermaus with a string of waltzes; the chorus is game to do some very non-waltzy moves to it, courtesy of movement director Steve Elias, but it doesn't quite work.We also believe even less, given the post-war freedoms, in Magda sacrificing herself so readily to the demands of propriety and, Violetta-like, yielding her beloved Ruggero to the conventional demands of his mamma. It's always going to look like a weak cop-out to contemporary audiences (""I've lived between shame and riches, bye now"") happening in double-quick time in a third act where Puccini has run low on the original melodies which power the first two – but doubly so in the update.Never mind: what works here has most of the gem-like orchestral colours and vocal glamour it needs. Matthew Kofi Waldren is excellent at steering the deft mood-changes and easy lilt of the score; no doubt once he knows it better, he'll lift his head to give more cues to the singers above him. The chorus certainly needs a bit more help in the co-ordination of the typically Puccinian swagger of the second act (think Café Momus with added stridency and – later, in the first duet of the act between the new lovers – a delicious take on swooning Lehárishness).The lighter couple, caddish musician Prunier and maid Lisette (for which read Rosalinde's Adele from Die Fledermaus, a girl who also wants to go on the stage but here gets to fail at it), are decently taken by Stephen Aviss and Tereza Gevorgyan (pictured above with Llewellyn in Act Three). I'd have liked more light-tenor charm, though, from Aviss, who's perhaps too baritonal at times. But in Matteo Lippi we have the genuine Italian article for the cipherish Ruggero: affable of manner, all at one loudish dynamic level, perhaps, but the top notes are never in doubt.Nor are Llewellyn's, and our hearts are with her from the start. There isn't much depth to be found – this rondine (swallow) is no traviata – but she does convey, and often thrillingly, the idea that ""love is always new"". And with the possibility of real swallows silhouetted above the awning, and peacock cries in time for the final scene on the French riviera, this most culinary of opera/operettas is a perfect fit for its west London setting.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-rondine-opera-holland-park-0,4
121,"L'Orfeo, EBS, Gardiner, Colston Hall, Bristol",L'Orfeo,EBS,2017-05-29,stephen Walsh,"This last of Sir John Eliot Gardiner’s semi-staged Monteverdi series took us back practically to the very start of the whole genre. L’Orfeo was presented in Mantua in 1607 as a court opera, and will have been seen and heard by a fraction of the number of people who crowded into Bristol’s Colston Hall on Sunday night. Between then and the Ulysses of 1641 the first public theatre opened in Venice, and the whole nature of opera was transformed.Anyone who has come across the madrigal group I Fagiolini’s Full Monteverdi performances will have an idea of how L’Orfeo emerged from the madrigals of Monteverdi’s just-previous fourth and fifth books. I Fagiolini sing the madrigals to brilliant effect in dramatised settings, seated perhaps as customers in a restaurant, suddenly breaking into passionate conversation, declarations of love, recriminations, abuse. L’Orfeo is very like that, only arranged around an actual story – the archetypal story of early opera. And suddenly you have the first masterpiece of the lyric stage, a hybrid maybe, but one of such immaculate theatrical judgement that the transition seems the most natural process in the world.The first act, an extended celebration of Orpheus’s love for Eurydice, is in one sense no more than a string of pearls: the usual allegorical boasting by some minor deity – here the Spirit of Music, nicely sung by Hana Blažíková, accompanying herself on the harp; then a brilliant sequence of choruses, dances and orchestral ritornelli, framing one grand formal aria, Orpheus’s “Rosa del ciel”. In another sense, though, it’s a quasi Puccinian set-up, softening us up for the announcement of Eurydice’s death by snake-bite at the start of Act 2 and Orpheus’s dramatic confrontation with Charon as he tries to cross the Styx to retrieve his bride.The drama is rather ceremonious, statuesque even, but none the less moving for that. For my money, Orpheus’s “Possente spirito” is one of the greatest tenor arias in the entire repertoire, and Krystian Adam (pictured above) despatched it with tremendous panache, brilliantly accompanied by the violins and assorted brass of the English Baroque Soloists. No wonder Charon, the sombre-voiced Gianluca Buratto, succumbed, if only by the self-exculpating device of falling asleep. On the return journey, Orpheus’s failure is due, not – as in Gluck – to Eurydice’s pleadings, but to his own doubts. His turning round was startling and perfectly timed, and drew a gasp from the Colston Hall audience. Then finally his long lament, and the inevitable deus ex machina with sackbuts (trombones).A better presentation of this beautiful, serene masterpiece would be hard to imagine. The music’s madrigalian character means a lot of work for the chorus, and here the Monteverdi Choir were in their element, singing, dancing and acting with verve, precision but evident enjoyment. As with the two later operas, Elsa Rooke manoeuvred everyone around the limited and somewhat perilous space with great skill and without mishap, the whole thing discreetly costumed by Patricia Hofstede, a peasant smock here, a satin party frock there, black of course for Hades, but in general just a faint touch of the come-as-you-are (but clean and tidy).The playing, a colourful mix of instruments known to have been used in 1607 (there is no full score), was incomparably eloquent and stylish, and the solo singing generally spot on. Blažíková’s Eurydice (one of several doublings) had faint memories of her Poppea, a shade too much arm, but musically fresh and personable, and it was nice to see her in the final act ensembles: no prima donna she but a versatile team-player. For the rest, there were no weak links but too many strong ones to list. Anna Dennis was excellent, for the third time of asking, as Speranza, the Hope that is abandoned entering Hades; Lucile Richardot handled superbly her long, slow entrance as the bearer of ill tidings. But in the end it was Adam and Buratto who mattered, the first great operatic confrontation; and Gardiner, the ultimate master of ceremonies.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/lorfeo-ebs-gardiner-colston-hall-bristol,5
122,The Mikado review - Sasha Regan's all-male operetta formula hits a reef,The Mikado review - Sasha Regan's all-male operetta formula hits a reef,,2017-05-25,David Nice,"Men playing boys playing girls, women and men, all female parts convincingly falsettoed and high musical standards as backbone: Sasha Regan's single-sex Gilbert and Sullivan has worked a special magic on Iolanthe and The Pirates of Penzance, HMS Pinafore and now The Mikado, not so much. Energetic song and dance are still in evidence. But this time a hard-worked scout-camp setting – located, as advance publicity tells us to expect, some time in the heyday of Enid Blyton – brings very little to highlight Gilbert's immortal preoccupations with class and hypothetical sadism.Familiar components bring some reassurance. The usually unsung hero of the Savoy spirit is music director and lone pianist Richard Baker: sprightly, rhythmically intense, supremely elegant with ornamentation, always there for his singers. The choruses especially, both masculine and feminine, truly zing, with well-trained voices throughout the company. And the miracle of femininity is also the best in the dialogue: as before, Alan Richardson in the Prima Donna role (pictured below). A beautiful sound it isn’t, but he hits the high notes full-on and his Yum-Yum actually manages to be touching as well as believable. Perhaps the one number in which the tents and the camp fire provide a trenchant context is in his/her duet with Nanki-Poo, ""Were you not to Ko-Ko plighted""; the notion of kissing tenderness being “beyond the law” has a certain piquancy if you get the (early) 1950s setting.Would that this Yum-Yum’s lover of convenience, heir to the Japanese throne masquerading as second trombonist, were up to her level. It shouldn’t have been difficult to find a sweet baby tenor fresh from the music colleges; Richard Munday (pictured below with the company) doesn’t bring beauty to the sound – so essential for ""A Wand'ring Minstrel I”, uglified by odd vowels – and his characterisation is weak. But then comic timing when it comes down to Gilbert’s crisp lines divorced from Sullivan’s music misfires generally. Even consummate Regan regular Alex Weatherhill doesn’t get many of the laughs Katisha deserves, however cruel. Both the ferocity and the pathos are undermined by the get-up – a headscarved Royston Vasey regular without the edge. And was it really necessary to have “Kat” pump up her bicycle at one of the few points where we might find sympathy in the music? Odd, this, because Regan is usually good at the deeper moments, supremely so in the Wilton’s Music Hall Iolanthe.Role misfires also mar in some degree the Pooh-Bah (Ross Finnie, good Scottish accent which actually makes “Titipu” sound funny but not nearly self-aggrandising enough) and David McKechnie‘s Ko-Ko, who should drop the over-emphatic mockney but whose saturnine energy would serve him well in a different context. I actually liked the little list, reworked to suit the putative period with good dismissal of dissonance in “Bluebeard’s Castle, Carmelites, Wozzeck and Peter Grimes”. Others may miss the lack of topical references, but it was rather clever to avoid the obvious. Jamie Jukes’ Pitti-Sing, though stronger in tandem with the usually sidelined Peep-Bo (Richard Russell Edwards, a face made for comedy), doesn’t make the impact the character can.Otherwise, there are the usual pleasures in pointed mugging from individuals in the chorus, good gags involving heads in tent entrances, tennis rackets and cricket bats (doubling as snickersnee/axe) and lively choreography from Holly Hughes which turns the not entirely necessary overture into a ballet. Ryan Dawson Laight’s simple set capitalises on three tents and a stylised forest at the back through which participants flit like woodland fairies. Regan follows the camp setting through with inventive brio; it just doesn’t come anywhere near a new solution to avoiding the Japonaiserie in this evergreen Savoy masterpiece. Who knows, maybe we need to see kimonos shimmer, fans flash and white make-up applied again; perhaps it’s time for the old to become the new once more.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera-theatre/mikado-review-sasha-regans-all-male-operetta-formula-hits-reef,3
123,"Sebestyén, Budapest Festival Orchestra, Fischer, RFH",Sebestyén,Budapest Festival Orchestra,2017-05-24,Sebastian Scotney,"This was a very fine concert indeed, plus a lot more. The first half was a very carefully planned series of unveilings around the theme of Béla Bartók and Hungarian folk music, the second an overwhelming performance of his Duke Bluebeard’s Castle.The evening started with conductor Iván Fischer evoking the crucial incident in Béla Bartók’s life when, newly graduated as pianist and composer, he was mesmerised by the folk singing of Lidi Dósa, a peasant girl from Gerlice. It was that experience which led him to head off to the villages of Hungary and Transylvania with Zoltán Kodály to document the heritage. Fischer played well-contrasted field recordings of folk singing from the collection of over 1,000 that Bartók and Kodály made on an Edison phonograph. Fischer then revealed the great Hungarian folk legend herself – and the daughter of one of Kodály’s pupils – Márta Sebestyén.Sebestyén (pictured right by Laszlo Perger) is an astonishing performer. She is that rare phenomenon, a figure of national significance whose communicative powers on stage can completely win over a large audience, most of whom cannot understand a single word she is singing. Someone who knew Anthony Minghella very well told me recently that what had lured him to her voice and her music, and presented him with the perfect music for The English Patient, was that “when you hear it you are not sure where it comes from.”That doesn’t just mean that there are common threads running through many different national heritages of folk music, it is also a testament to Sebestyén’s capacity to shape her voice in a way that she almost seems remote from tone production, to be somehow hearing herself from a distance. I loved the way she helped this sense of illusion by hinting through gesture that she might be imitating the sound of the bagpipes, or a guitar. Joined by three string players from the Budapest Festival Orchestra (including András Szabó, an orchestral horn player, on silky smooth yet punchy folk viola), she gave a constant sense of strong rhythmic propulsion, but also of a lightness and ease. This was a demonstration of sheer joy in music-making. I could have happily listened to at least two full sets.Her two appearances on stage were separated by Bartók’s orchestral versions of Hungarian Peasant Songs from 1933. There were strong affinities in this music with Kodály’s Dances of Galánta, written in the same year. The performance brought out for the first time the sheer warmth and unanimity of the BFO’s string sections. The quality of the orchestra as a whole was there to admire throughout the second half, too. From principal clarinet Ákos Ács as strong solo lead but also a spectral presence, to the gentleness of the flute section, and the superhuman control of principal horn Zoltán Szoke, this is an orchestra which – surely – does not have a single weak link.The listener can also admire the depth and detail of the work that has gone in to the performance to elucidate and balance every texture in every bar of the music. If the thought ever enters your head that this level of preparation is going to lead to a safe performance, Fischer can be seen whipping up energy and intensity, cajoling the players to deliver the peaks of the work with intensity and conviction.Judith in Duke Bluebeard’s Castle is a signature role for Ildikó Komlósi who has performed it over 150 times. In her wonderfully judged interpretation, the character’s unremitting search for answers never seemed repetitive. There may be singers who can deliver more tonal beauty and possibly more power, but Komlósi had the audience unfailingly involved in her hopeless quest. True bass Krisztián Cser (pictured above by Hermann Peter) as Bluebeard was at his best in the story-telling episode when he tells Judith about his previous wives. The two soloists both gave authenticity, understanding and constant fresh insights into the bleak technicolour of Duke Bluebeard’s Castle.

124,"Hipermestra / La Traviata, Glyndebourne",Hipermestra / La Traviata,Glyndebourne,2017-05-22,ismene Brown," A Saudi princess in her white wedding dress digs her own grave as men pile up stones to hurl at her head — next, an Isis fighter is stabbing a knife at her neck to decapitate her. Ah, the fate of the heroine of the average baroque opera about the appalling ways of men and gods. Add in the bearded lady in a burqa, and you don’t know whether to laugh or cry on the opening day of the new Glyndebourne season. Graham Vick’s production of Francesco Cavalli’s 359-year-old opera Hipermestra is certainly extremist opera.Yet what an extreme opera this is. Here is a faithful young bride defying her father’s command to kill her new husband for tribal reasons, and then being tortured by her husband. The fact that there are 50 sisters marrying 50 brothers is an incidental cause of OTT visual comedy, but the centre is tragedy — deadly patriarchal politics, instant jealousy in a society where a woman is not permitted to act on her own initiative, internecine war between men at the gods’ command, these are themes that Vick argues plausibly are very much more of our time now than, say, La Traviata’s.And thus, when Hipermestra finally got its UK premiere, it was in provocative YouTube and news TV imagery: oil-rich Arab palaces where the mass wedding is dressed in staggering kitsch, and then later black-clad, bearded fighters stride through the palatial wreckage, as if a modern Palmyra, incongruously warbling recitatives in soft countertenors and reedy high tenors.A major factor in the spectator's reaction is the incredibly extravagant set-building by Stuart Nunn, who comically reveals oil rigs behind the opulent wedding bed, or instantly transforms the wedding salon into the hideous execution yard, while the second-act curtain raise over the bombed-out wreckage is awesome. It does a great deal to divert you from the discomfiting lack of arias and the sheer torrent of action and recitative — this is more of a sung play than an opera, in effect.There’s little noble about the behaviour, but psychologically nothing about men changes in 350 years, as Vick’s prunings show. Linceo, the husband who suddenly takes against the wife who saved him from her father’s execution order, acts out of instinctive ownership of a woman as a tribal trophy. Now that countertenors rather than castrati roam our stages, this vocally extreme role can be given the kind of macho welly and buff physique that Raffaele Pe delivers.What stamina and skill those 17th-century singers must have had to perform roles like his and Hipermestra’s, almost never-ending recitative, with no places to pause and reflect. Pe was audibly ragged towards the end — not so the lustrous Hungarian soprano Emöke Baráth in the title role, devastating in her acting of a very long-suffering role, and with singing both pellucid and deeply emotional at the great confrontations of love and loyalty forced on her by her father and husband. And what, indeed, would anyone do confronted by such a choice?Still, hype about Hipermestra should rest on Vick's gleeful interpretative liberties rather than Cavalli's neglect. It’s a relief that the parallel story of the gods’ machinations in the story has been lost in time — the original opera was five hours long — though there is one divinely jawdropping moment when Hipermestra flings herself from the ruined parapet to be rescued by a passing peacock (pictured above, the ruins of Act 3). And the bearded lady is both the sisters’ nurse and a god in bawdy disguise, played to the hilt by Mark Wilde like a cross between Les Dawson and Julian Clary — and singing like it too, which is fine.So, much supersizing here, of contemporary logical leaps, low comedy, and mad theatrical clutter; the masterstroke is that such rude visual extravagance is underpinned by tiny musical forces. William Christie and his miniature band of eight string players are part of the action, dressed as Arabian street musicians, wandering up on stage with theorbos, violones, lirones, their playing always delicate and ironically pointed under the excess, and you hardly miss Cavalli's hour-long balletic battle with 62 dancing fighters that had to be cut.At the end, as the two warriors reconcile with their ever-loving women, they shroud them in hijabs and lead them off docilely to a future that we would still shudder at, even if it’s by consent. Cosi fan tutte comes suddenly to mind in that last tableau — or rather, ""così fan tutti"". It’s how men behave.To follow Hipermestra with La Traviata looks like feminist counterpoint. This revival of Tom Cairns’ 2014 production is visually muted, designed in sombre fascistic monumentality by Hildegard Bechtler, in a less successful transplantation of period. Violetta, the notorious consumptive, lives and dies in the social whirl of the 20th century long after TB sufferers were isolated to prevent contagion. There appears to be a suggestion of her as an anachronism, a phantom from an earlier time or a 19th-century painting — the invention of the male gaze.This thought is reinforced by a magnetic shift of focus onto the father of the hero, Giorgio Germont, often the stock, stuffy baritone dad come to pour cold water on the young lovers’ ardour. In a remarkable performance, the Bolshoi soloist Igor Golovatenko effortlessly centred the story on Père Germont’s charisma. Here is not a provincial nondescript but a powerful businessman (an oligarch perhaps), who must retain his estate not through his loser son Alfredo but through the marriage of his unseen daughter to a business partner.Watching him strip off his coat, then scarf, then jacket, and then roll up his sleeves as he dealt with first the impediment of Violetta and then the recalcitrance of Alfredo was like watching Marlon Brando sort out the junior family in The Godfather. Golovatenko sings tremendously, not with boomy Russian depths but with a metallic, articulate baritone, every intention clear. No wonder Zach Borichevsky’s lanky young Alfredo came over so maladroit, touching in the acting performance, even if his tenor sounds much happier loud than soft. Whether some intonation difficulties were due to the underfloor position of the London Philharmonic Orchestra I don’t know, but in Glyndebourne's compact auditorium there can be audio problems, and Richard Farnes directed a lean, sprightly orchestral texture that sometimes favoured dance rhythms over emotional depth — “Addio del passato"" was quite the waltz-song.But the affecting Violetta of Kristina Mkhitaryan (pictured above) has the range to convert Farnes’ lilting pulses into deeply felt moments without miring them in Slav clotted cream. She began as rather a modest creature at her own soirée, adrift from the modish modern guests in her 19th-century dress. But so quickly did she and her voice grow in emotional generosity, and so startlingly moving was her final scene, that the restrained start had its own arc — a gentle white flower blooming and fading.She dies alone, the men around her vanishing as she transforms in a visionary fade, pale and shrouded in her long black hair. Is this death? Or is Violetta a male fantasy? It’s an interesting idea. But no mistake, Mkhitaryan put a full-blooded, agonised question mark over her dying cry of “Joy”.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/hipermestra-la-traviata-glyndebourne,4
125,"Y Tŵr, MTW, Sherman Theatre, Cardiff",Y Tŵr,MTW,2017-05-20,stephen Walsh,"Until yesterday my only experience of the Welsh language in the opera house was a few isolated passages in Iain Bell’s In Parenthesis last year and the surtitles WNO routinely put up alongside the English in the Millennium Centre. Now Guto Puw, a 46-year-old composer from north Wales, has written an entire opera for Music Theatre Wales and the Carmarthen-based Theatr Genedlaethol in this beautiful language of which I’m ashamed to say I know not a single word apart from a handful of road signs and the unexpected pepperings of English (“Electric – Price – Bloody Job” was one whole phrase I caught) that prove the language’s antiquity, as well as perhaps to some extent its laziness.Puw’s opera Y Tŵr (The Tower) is based by its librettist Gwyneth Glyn on a 1978 play by Gwenlyn Parry about the progress through life of two people, initially a Girl and a Lad (they are never named), then mature Man and Woman, and finally Old Man and Old Woman – seven ages reduced to three, or maybe more, since there is some progress (if that’s the right word) at each stage. It’s a grim journey in any case, watched over by the tower in which the couple seem to live and up which they proceed, age by age, until – in the libretto, though not quite so clearly in Michael McCarthy’s production – the Old Man, having been fed an overdose by his wife, disappears up the final ladder into – what? Heaven? Oblivion? You take your pick, but the disagreeable solution is the more likely to be the right one.There is the Welsh lullaby, 'Suo gân', sweet then sourAny full-length two-person show runs the risk of monotony, and I must admit I wearied of this couple some time before the end, brilliantly though they were played and sung by Caryl Hughes and Gwion Thomas. But at no point did I tire of Puw’s score in this his first opera, a work of real imaginative power, full of movement and colour, and rich in ideas that responded to and intensified the drama. This is a chamber opera, with an orchestra of a dozen or so; but Puw found in this small mixed ensemble an amazing variety of sonority, and a flow of striking musical imagery that at times had one on the edge of one’s seat waiting for more.As a drama, Y Tŵr is somewhat stereotyped and predictable. But Puw makes a virtue of this with musical reprises at each stage: there is train music (shades of Steve Reich) and butterfly music for the girl’s recurrent dream which, in the later scenes, turns increasingy nasty; and there is the Welsh lullaby, “Suo gân,” sweet in the first scene, soured by the third.Not many composers have this much feel for the balance of moods and the ability to move easily between them (as Wagner said, opera is the art of transition). My only reservation would be that, like many first operas, Y Tŵr is a trifle overscored, a little too active in the orchestra. But Puw writes fluently for the voices, who seemed to ride above the web of sound without too much strain; and, as we already know, Welsh is a lovely language to sing, even if you’ve no idea what it means.McCarthy’s staging is clear and unmannered, a single functional set (Samal Blak) with a bit of furniture moving and a symbolic rolling up of carpets to indicate a change of level. Mystery, though, is in short supply; the tower is nothing but the ladder, and the prosaic lives of these two characters (pictured above as Lad and Girl) – their loving and rowing and dreaming – are straight soap opera, largely devoid of poetry or spirituality. Maybe they deserve whatever revenge the tower has in store for them after all.I wouldn’t be quite so hard on the MTW Ensemble, but they were certainly not at their best on this first night. Richard Baker conducted with plenty of oomph, but the ensemble was less than immaculate and tuning, in exposed unisons, sometimes shaky. This will improve, and Y Tŵr should be seen, here or on tour. Good opera composers emphatically do not grow on trees, even in the land of song, and Puw promises to be one.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/y-t%C5%B5r-mtw-sherman-theatre-cardiff,4
126,"Ariodante, The English Concert, Bicket, Barbican",Ariodante,The English Concert,2017-05-17,alexandra Coghlan,"To hear The English Concert playing Handel is to arrive in technicolour Oz after a lifetime of black and white baroque in Kansas. We’re not short on period bands in the UK, but few bring this music into anything like the kind of focus that Harry Bicket and his crack team of musicians achieve, nor demonstrate such love and joy in the process. The solo line-up may have been starry, but the hero of this Ariodante was the orchestra.Even by Handel’s standards, the plot of Ariodante is a curious one. A happy beginning and ending frame a central conflict of disturbing darkness (a Much Ado-style conceit of mistaken identities, accusations of impurity and a death that turns out not to be). Coupled with some of the composer’s most extended arias – musical soliloquies of rare psychological depth – the result is a work of Shakespearean breadth, whose sudden shifts of mood and tone require careful handling if they are not to seem absurd.It’s almost a relief, then, to see a performance stripped of these, allowing the music’s mercurial moods to dart and shift unfettered. No director was credited, but, as usual with the Barbican’s operas-in-concert, there was plenty of movement and interaction from performers, singing largely without scores. No one witnessing the predatory seductions and gropings of Sonia Prina’s villainous Polinesso (pictured above with Mary Bevan's Dalinda), nor the abject despair of Matthew Brook’s King, collapsed to his knees at the thought of his daughter’s betrayal, could have felt dramatically short-changed.With the originally advertised Joyce DiDonato (Ariodante) replaced by Alice Coote, as Joelle Harvey also was as Dalinda by Mary Bevan, the performance became less of a star vehicle and more of an ensemble affair, with some superb singing right across the roles. If Christiane Karg’s radiant Ginevra (pictured below with Alice Coote's Ariodante) – nimble and composed in her coloratura, expansive if never risk-takingly bold in her mad scene – was the predictable stand-out, it was American tenor David Portillo (a lyrical David in Glyndebourne’s Meistersinger) who was the dark horse. The role of Lurcanio is a fairly thankless collage of pretty arias and incidental emotion, but his sweet-toned simplicity and unexpectedly exciting upper register turned his romantic sub-plot into something altogether more interesting.Bevan too made something rich of Dalinda – tempering the golden brightness of Karg’s soprano with her own more coppery, covered tone, and Bradley Smith’s blink-and-you’ll-miss-it Odoardo was a tantalising promise without the fulfilment of an aria.The opera’s two mezzos (not a counter-tenor in sight) were a more mixed bag. Always an assertive performer, Prina now nears caricature in both her voice and stage manner. Playing tricky semiquaver passages for laughs only works so many times, and what was once heroic coloratura now has an oddly hollowed-out quality – the energy remains, but none of the tone. Coote’s voice, by contrast, is in great shape. The visual ticks and tricks of her performance won’t be to all tastes, but it’s an unorthodox delivery that she makes work, evening out the surging, gulping frenzy of “Cieca notte” for a “Scherza infida” whose anguish was all the more powerful for its absolute control. “Dopo notte” too was kept unusually muted – an aria of rejoicing that trod the fine line between real joy and bewilderment.But for all the excitement of the voices, it’s the instruments I find myself coming back to. Alberto Grazzi’s bassoon – a baroque saxophone, crooning in sympathy with Coote’s nightclub ballad of a “Scherza infida”; the two horns (Ursula Paludan Monberg, Martin Lawrence) bringing not just the brash festal brilliance but also moments of ear-defying delicacy in their contributions; and Bicket’s own characterful continuo playing: accompaniment which elevated it to dramatic dialogue.@AlexaCoghlan",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/ariodante-english-concert-bicket-barbican,4
127,"Turandot, Opera North",Turandot,Opera North,2017-05-15,graham Rickson,"I’ve seen the future, and it’s semi-staged. The gains here are far more significant than the losses. And where Opera North’s minimalist Leeds Town Hall Ring let Peter Mumford’s video projections fill in the gaps, this new production of Turandot is costumed, lit and directed, lacking only a backdrop. The chorus are squeezed stage right, tightly crammed into the choir seats. The cast gamely do their thing in the narrow space betwixt strings and stage.For such a macabre, dark work, there’s an awful lot of grinning going on – notably from Opera North’s on-form orchestra, gleefully let off the leash in this most startlingly modern of Puccini operas. Tintinnabulists will swoon at the sight of 13 tuned gongs, and how often do we get to actually see a real cimbasso perched next to the trombones? Conductor Sir Richard Armstrong revels in the opera’s brassier excesses. It’s excessively, joyously loud in places, but I didn’t see anyone complaining.Listen blind, and it’s hard to believe that this score was written in 1924. Puccini’s stark, declamatory choral writing and outré harmonies sound as fresh as paint, and, until the problematic close, there’s not a wasted note. I’ve rarely heard anything as musically exciting as this production’s first few minutes: a series of savage chords depicting the falling of an executioner’s axe followed by the Mandarin’s angular declamation, sternly dispatched by a nattily-dressed Dean Robinson. All terrific, and then the chorus enter, their combined force powerful enough to dislodge a toupée in the rear stalls.  Annabel Arden’s staging revels in the physical constraints, the plotting and characterisation much clearer as a result. Alastair Miles’s Timur is a shabby, cowed wretch, his blindness implied with a mere smidgeon of face paint. Sunyoung Seo’s downcast, plainly dressed Liù stands out among the supporting cast, able to reduce her voice to a whisper while losing none of its colour. Rafael Rojas as Calaf is an impetuous, headstrong joy, his high register unchallenged by Puccini's louder tuttis. Set and costume designer Joanna Parker’s sole prop is a giant wobbly throne which begins to teeter precariously. Underneath which we catch a fleeting glimpse of Orla Boylan’s Turandot (pictured right) early on, a terrifying sight in metallic grey and black feathers. Her voice is suitably commanding and steely, only gradually revealing its warmth in the last act. And dressing Gavan Ring, Joseph Shovelton and Nicholas Watts’s Ping, Pang and Pong (below, left) as white faced circus clowns reminds us of their commedia dell'arte roots, the trio making brilliant use of suitcases, surgical instruments and a human skeleton.Bonaventura Bottone’s Altoun exudes scary authority. Armstrong and Arden ratchet up the tension as the evening progresses, and it’s difficult to suppress a cheer as Calaf solves Turandot’s three riddles. Rojas’s sweet-toned Nessun dorma is utter perfection, aided by immaculate chorus work, and what a surprise it is to hear this iconic aria in context: Puccini‘s refusal to linger a real slap in the face. It’s the final scene which doesn’t quite work. Turandot and Calaf’s love duet, completed after Puccini’s death by Franco Alfano, feels like too easy a resolution and can’t help sounding a bit, er, 19th century after what’s gone before. Adventurous listeners should seek out Berio’s much more radical 2001 attempt. Until that completion enters the repertoire, Opera North’s production will do, in spades. You can’t imagine Turandot being performed with greater gusto.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/turandot-opera-north,5
128,"L'Incoronazione di Poppea, EBS, Gardiner, Colston Hall, Bristol",L'Incoronazione di Poppea,EBS,2017-05-09,stephen Walsh,"Whatever musicologists may tell us about the patchy authenticity of Monteverdi’s last two operas, they unquestionably make a pair. Il ritorno di Ulisse is all about fidelity and ends with a love duet between the reunited husband and wife. L’Incoronazione di Poppea is almost entirely dedicated to infidelity and ends with a disturbingly beautiful love duet between the adulterous couple, Nero and Poppea, after he has exiled his wife, Ottavia, and ordered his moralising tutor, Seneca, to kill himself, among other equally vicious, if slightly less murderous, diktats.Happily Monteverdi’s only other surviving opera, L’Orfeo, which John Eliot Gardiner has chosen to conduct last in the cycle (on May 28) though it was by a long way the first to be composed, reinstates fidelity. It will be a great relief.Poppea, for me, is a problem piece. It spends the best part of three hours organising the satisfaction of Nero and his flibbertigibbet mistress over the dead bodies – literally or otherwise – of anyone with a modicum of virtue who gets in their way. Then it spends another 20 minutes or so congratulating them.It’s an opera with beautiful moments but mauvais quarts d’heure. It lacks development: the lovers are much the same at the end as they were at the beginning (ie. horrible), and the music, too, lacks growth, and is generally less varied, in pace and character, than that of Ulisse. One listens out for irony, but in vain – the mockery, such as it is, is directed against virtue; and in fact almost the only thing to be said in the lovers’ favour is that they are unremittingly honest. But a lack of hypocrisy is poor consolation for petty, unrestrained nastiness.Kangmin Justin Kim and Hana Blažíková (pictured above) struggled to make these figures worth the spotlight Monteverdi shines on them. Blažíková overplayed the manipulative siren like fury, weaving her body and waving her arms like a demented octopus, and her singing was only so-so, fluent but short of warmth and, especially in the final duet, inclined to drift off pitch. Kim was steadier (except, perhaps by osmosis, in the duet); an excellent, stylish countertenor, not flattered, though, by a blond wig (I suppose it was) and a long blue frock coat, and not fully equal to the repulsive persona required by the scenario.By far the best singing came from Marianna Pizzolato as Ottavia, and the bass Gianluca Buratto as poor Seneca, a character between nobility and pomposity, who speaks in platitudes but behaves throughout with dignity, almost alone in the opera. Carlo Vistoli was adequate, or a little more, as Poppea’s doomed lover Ottone (pictured below), but Anna Dennis brought the same flair to Drusilla as to the maid Melanto in Ulisse, a less pragmatic character but with something of the same vivacity.Silvia Frigato was a bright-voiced Amore; but this allegorical role is hard to pitch acceptably, triumphalism being tiresome in a cupid in black tights, and her overacting was unhelpful. Lucile Richardof was a dark-voiced Arnalta, Poppea’s nurse and an image of parvenu ruthlessness in the making. Penelope, where art thou now?As before, the playing by the English Baroque Soloists and ensemble singing by members of the Monteverdi Choir under John Eliot Gardiner was without serious flaw. It’s a treat in these semi-staged performances to be able to watch the orchestra, to see the violins and recorders and cornets pop to their feet like so many jack-in-the-boxes and to study the assorted lutes and chitarrones as they growl and jangle their way through Monteverdi’s unspecified continuo part. Gardiner conjured up a rich and often exciting sonority from the bald essentials of the manuscripts, and Elsa Rooke again choreographed matters effectively up and down the platform steps and in and around the players and conductor. It was a long evening offering plenty to enjoy, except, for this grouser, the work itself.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/lincoronazione-di-poppea-ebs-gardiner-colston-hall-bristol,3
129,"Doctor Atomic, BBCSO, Adams, Barbican",Doctor Atomic,BBCSO,2017-04-26,David Nice,"Bomb-dropping is the new black again in Trump's dysfunctional America. Awareness of that contributed to the crackling cloud of dynamic dread hanging over last night's concert staging of John Adams's opera-oratorio - my description, not his - about the July 1945 desert testing of the plutonium bomb under the supervision of self-divided Robert Oppenheimer, an American Faust. But then the music's insistent stepwise descents towards the centre of the earth, in various modes and illuminated colours, the claustrophobic volume of much of the variegated score in the no-escape close-ups of the Barbican, a superlative team of singers (miked, to boot), and Adams's own heavy insistence as a conductor of the indefatigable BBC Symphony Orchestra also intensified the oppressive horror.Adams's inspiration level is high and the shifting, complex orchestral textures and rhythms always compel even when the ideas do not. He dares more even than in the world of El Niño, the millennial response to Christ's birth which Doctor Atomic so often evokes - and it was fresh in our minds following Adams' LSO performance in the Barbican at the end of last year (this, of course, is his 70th). But where that pure oratorio's collage of texts is successfully distributed among its three soloists, counter-tenor trio and chorus, the attempt to pin them on characters which Adams and his inseparable collaborator Peter Sellars can't seem to decide whether they want to develop or not sometimes makes one wince here. The didactic opening is fine - no problem if it smacks of Brecht and Weill's Lehrstücke or ""lesson-dramas"". But then the elephant in the room is the absence of that extraordinary poet Alice Goodman, who provided two of the 20th century's best librettos - yes, Hofmannsthal-worthy - for the two previous operas, Nixon in China and The Death of Klinghoffer, and, alas, withdrew from this project at a crucial stage.Here there's poetry of a banality Goodman would never have produced, chiefly Muriel Rukeyser's in the mouth of Kitty Oppenheimer; lines like ""the hackneyed light of evening quarrelling with the bulbs"" are the wrong words in the wrong place. You're sitting there dreading the emergence of something like Ronald Duncan's ""oatmeal slippers of sleep"" in one of the worst opera libretti ever, for Britten's The Rape of Lucretia. Even the magnificent Julia Bullock (pictured right by Brett Arnold), her delivery conveying much of the urgent vocal style Adams engaged to serve the late, great Lorraine Hunt Lieberson and the still-resplendent Dawn Upshaw alongside something of Leontyne Price's vocal colour, can't quite get away with that at first.Bullock does, though, manage to move us with Kitty's gran scena at the beginning of Act Two, the opposite pole to Oppenheimer's ""Batter My Heart"". That's the Act One finale clincher which compels even if it doesn't feel quite dramatically prepared. This passion aria, dragging us downwards with pity and terror as it responds so brilliantly to Donne's text between fissile bursts of orchestral static, belongs to its co-creator, Gerald Finley. He rose to it as superbly as ever last night, leaving half the audience wild with performer-worship and the other  half stunned by the context. Let's just say that I didn't want to talk to anyone in the interval.Adams' vocal writing - so much more focused than that of contemporary Thomas Adès, however strenuous at times - gives grateful moments of significance even to the secondary characters, all of them flawlessly well taken last night. That was why Samuel Sakker's Captain James Nolan froze us in horror in one of the score's few still moments, telling of plutonium's effect on the human body, and why a second tenor, Andrew Staples, mesmerised us with his dream of falling (Adams gives the similar nightmare of Musorgsky's Pretender-to-be in Boris Godunov a good run for its money here).In Act Two, the human response to the impending catastrophe has a numinous twist in the contralto range of Tewa Indian Pasqualita, a very specific irole,  if slightly over-extended in its vatic melismas. The always impressive Jennifer Johnston had exactly the right timbre for those, the opposite pole to nature-irritated General Groves (Aubrey Allicock, authoritative and terse, pictured left). Since the first solo voice we heard was that of the firm-projecting bass Brindley Sherratt as ironical scientist Edward Teller, I wondered if the miking was necessary, but it seemed well managed and the pre-recorded soundscapes, pinning us to our seats with just the right degree of volume, were superbly well handled. Let's not forget the many phosphorescent orchestral solos, either - James Burke's clarinet writhing above a downward-dragging trio of trombones, Nicholas Korth's horn lighting up the desert moonscape.Director Kenneth Richardson made it simple and easy for the singers to work with scores - presumaby Finley didn't need to, but it would have looked uncollegial for him to give his familiar performance without one - and to convey just the right suggestion of character - not that there's a lot of it - at the same time. Lighting effects were maybe unnecessary, smoke effects definitely so; otherwise, little intruded, as in ENO's 2009 production. Insistence on American vowels and consonants could sound a bit overdone from the BBC Singers (""madder"" rather than ""matter"" in the opening chorus), but the text was always clear, hair-raisingly so in the big Vishnu apparition of Act Two - well prepared by Finley's crumpled expression suggesting Oppenheimer on the brink of breakdown before the explosion.That sustained 90-minute countdown to the inevitable demands a lot from orchestra, singers and audience. I found it more consistently compelling at ENO, but the arrival of Ground Zero and its aftermath, with Japanese voices begging for water into the void, was properly appalling. It takes a lot to rise to so terrible a subject, and Adams (pictured above taking a bow) may be the only opera composer in the world today who could bring it off. And the good news, revealed by a commenter below, is that while this performance will be broadcast on BBC Radio 3 at a later date, the same forces set down the interpretation in the studio earlier, offering us the prospect of a much-needed CD release.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/doctor-atomic-bbcso-adams-barbican,4
130,"The Exterminating Angel, Royal Opera",The Exterminating Angel,Royal Opera,2017-04-25,Peter Quantrill,"""But is any of this normal?,"" asks poor Beatriz at the end of Act One. Of course not. She and 14 other grand creatures are crossing the space of an aristocratic drawing-room from which, they are coming to realise, there is no escape. At the same time, it’s completely normal. This is opera.What appalling fun Thomas Adès has with the business of opera in The Exterminating Angel, given its UK premiere last night by the Royal Opera. Its conventions, faults, virtues, singers, audiences, even conductors: all are skewered by a pen of poison-tipped invention. Imagine chomping your way through an entire bar of artisan chocolate, 85 percent cocoa, expensively packaged, black and bitter to the end. It gets a bit much, like going cover to cover through a compendium of Gerald Scarfe cartoons.Anyone familiar with the Luis Buñuel film from which Adès and his librettist Tom Cairns have adapted their subject – and anyone intrigued by glowing reviews of the premiere production at the Salzburg Festival last summer – may rest assured: the sheep are here. They are good English sheep now, of course, whose van could be seen – and smelled – from the other end of Floral Street. From Salzburg comes the all-star ensemble cast. It is considered poor form to pick out favourites, though I will venture to say that their parts – or their astute casting – divide down generational lines.The windy fustian of John Tomlinson’s doctor, the dazed enchantment of Anne Sofie von Otter’s old bag (pictured above with Tomlinson), the eruptions of Sir Thomas Allen’s maestro, are all character roles, and hardly more so than the stiff bewilderment of the Colonel (David Adam Moore), the magnificently impulsive explorer-Count (Frédéric Antoun) or Eduardo and Beatriz (Ed Lyon and Sophie Bevan), the two young lovers. To them is given (of course) the opera’s loveliest music, a deliquescent duet of lines as softly entwining as their limbs, somewhere between life and death.The duet is as shocking in its way as the artful parodies and pastiches that litter the rest of the opera. One highlight was the return of the sheep (soon to be roast lamb) in Act Three, to a monstrous perversion of ""Sheep may safely graze"". This is a score of infernal ingenuity, hectic and even relentless in the first two acts, before switches of scene – inside and out, as in the film – bring changes of pace. Though the orchestral writing feels mostly familiar in its stratagems from the composer’s work of the last 15 years, it is now capped by vocal lines drawn as deftly as their characters, and by the sweeping wail of an ondes martenot that may represent the exterminating angel itself.Most compelling were the characters in mid-life, like Adès himself: Sally Matthews, spellbinding as a silly but increasingly sympathetic widow and mother; Iestyn Davies as her self-obsessed brother with a little Baroque lament over missing coffee spoons; the thrilling high tenor of Charles Workman as the gracious host, and his wife, superbly sung by Amanda Echalaz. At least for them some scintilla of sympathy may be roused.Designer Hildegard Bechtler has effectively repurposed her reassuringly haut-bourgeois proscenium and backdrop from the Royal Opera/La Scala production of Die Frau ohne Schatten, staged in 2012 and certainly due for revival. There were murmurs around me about the low level of Jon Clark’s lighting, but it produced many effects no less subtly effective than Cairns’s staging, not least a receding sense of revelation and a dawning of new terror as the opera moves from its climactic chaconne to a savage ""taking back"" of the triumphant close to Messiaen’s St François d’Assise.The characters enter their lethal and lethargic stupor (pictured above, the ensemble in extremis) after the first of the opera’s interpolations to the cinematic narrative, a set of piano variations on (we are told) a Sephardi Jewish theme. Led by Audrey Luna’s coloratura diva, they finally sing their way out of it to a psalm-like text: ""I am the wail of jackals, I am the violin for your songs"". Music is the force that Adès believes in.@peterquantrill",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/exterminating-angel-royal-opera,4
131,"Il Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria, EBS, Gardiner, Colston Hall, Bristol",Il Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria,EBS,2017-04-13,stephen Walsh,"“Never give one concert if you can give a hundred” might stand as a motto for the conductor who once hauled his choir and orchestra round the world performing all 200 or so of Bach’s cantatas. And mathematically Sir John Eliot Gardiner’s latest project is a nearly exact honouring of that idea. Three operas by Monteverdi survive (out of 10 or a dozen), and Gardiner claims to be taking his semi-staged productions to 33 cities – just one short of the hundred performances.To complete the arithmetic, the tour is honouring Monteverdi’s 450th birthday this year; and to complete the geography, the performing odyssey began last night, in Bristol, with his penultimate opera, the one about Ulysses (alias Odysseus) and his return to Ithaca after the Trojan wars and his subsequent years of Homeric wanderingThe Ritorno in Monteverdi’s title is crucial. The opera begins with Ulysses’s arrival back on his native island, and its real subject is recognition and reunion. Ulysses has a series of encounters, each time at first unrecognised, then quickly recognised except in the crucial last case, the reunion with his wife, Penelope, who obstinately refuses to believe he is who he seems until he accurately describes the embroidered coverlet on her bed. Monteverdi makes huge dramatic play of the Shakespearean idea that those who love the most are slowest to recognise its object.At the other end of the scale are the light-headed servant girls who will love anything in trousers, and who urge everyone else to do the same. And in the middle are Penelope’s suitors, whose love is selective and calculating, a mere simulacrum. Metaphorically they can’t string Ulysses’s bow, beautifully shown in Elsa Rooke’s staging in the form of Penelope’s raised arm, which Ulysses himself (still disguised) then enfolds symbolically with his own. These different types of love provide the slow rhythm of the drama, superbly paced throughout except near the end of the long evening, when the buffo interludes perhaps slightly outstay their welcome.It’s incredible that Monteverdi was once thought of as a prehistoric figure, inchoate and primitive. Gardiner’s Ritorno showed that, on the contrary, his style of recitative, constantly in motion between a sort of dry chatter and informal lyrical song, with every shade in between, is probably the most sophisticated form of word-setting known to man. It not only gives amazing freedom of expression, but it also opens out differences of character: between Penelope (the dark-voiced, stately French mezzo Lucile Richardot) and Ulysses (the well-named Furio Zanasi, temperamental, verbose, angry at his treatment by the relentless gods - the two finally together pictured above); or between the three suitors, or even within individual characters, like the goddess Minerva (the brilliant Hana Blažíková), who appears first as a carefree shepherd boy. The music, so superficially simple in its means, emerges as a kaleidoscope of character and dramatic expression, engaging, colourful, witty, and profoundly moving.Gardiner’s cast fulfilled all these criteria, weaving their way deftly round and through the orchestra, with its superb array of chitarrones and archlutes, its trumpeting cornetti and Gwyneth Farkas’s baroque harp, which had also at one point to survive the attentions of the glutton Irus (Robert Burt). Gianluca Buratto was outstanding in the triple role of Time, Neptune and the suitor Antinoo, a resonant but supple bass (pictured right as Neptune); Anna Dennis, with some of the prettiest music and most scandalous philosophy as the maid Melanto, sang and acted with spirit and style; and there were notable performances also from Francisco Fernández-Rueda, as the old shepherd Eumete, Krystian Adam as Telemachus, and others too numerous to list.The playing by the English Baroque Soloists seemed to me nearly flawless, and I liked very much Rooke’s discreet but poised use of the quite limited Colston Hall platform, somehow at times creating the flavour – if hardly the detail – of a Mantegna canvas. I’ve praised semi-stagings here before now. They spare us the more extreme conceptual nonsenses, and put directors on their mettle to capture the essence with restricted means. It’s amazing how well it can work. Let’s hope for something as good in Poppea and Orfeo.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/il-ritorno-dulisse-patria-ebs-gardiner-colston-hall-bristol,5
132,"Patience/Tosca, English Touring Opera",Patience/Tosca,English Touring Opera,2017-04-12,Richard Bratby,"How well do you know your bad Victorian poetry? “When through the purple corridors the screaming scarlet Ibis flew/In terror, and a horrid dew dripped from the moaning Mandragores.” Go on, guess the author. Or how about this? “What time the poet hath hymned/The writhing maid, lithe-limbed,/Quivering on amaranthine asphodel"". Got it yet? The first is Oscar Wilde’s The Sphinx, from 1881. The second, WS Gilbert’s libretto for Patience – written in the same year, and skewering Wilde with gleeful relish and lethal precision.If Liam Steel’s new production of Patience for English Touring Opera proves anything, it’s that the sheer accuracy of Gilbert’s satire is both a strength and a potential liability. Sullivan’s music makes Colonel Calverley’s Act One patter song bustle along so entertainingly (and in Andrew Slater’s performance it’s accompanied by vigorous physical activity) that that there isn’t much time to wonder about the exact cultural references behind Gilbert’s “Smack of Lord Waterford”, “Coolness of Paget” or “Swagger of Roderick”, to say nothing of the “keen penetration of Paddington Pollaky”. ETO provides a glossary in the programme, bringing to mind David Mitchell’s line as Shakespeare in Upstart Crow: ”It just requires lengthy explanations and copious footnotes. If you do your research, my stuff is actually really funny.”But ETO’s Patience really is funny, and never more so than when Bradley Travis’s Reginald Bunthorne (pictured above) holds the stage. He languishes. He droops. He carries a huge peacock-feather quill and wears a floppy velvet cap. He strikes stained-glass attitudes on pedestals, he brandishes lilies and gazes soulfully from beneath his lank Early English haircut. Travis is the Bunthorne of your dreams; infinitely more than just an Oscar Wilde tribute act, he’s so far inside Gilbert’s ludicrous but basically loveable creation that you can imagine him going home and contemplating his blue china. His light, agreeable baritone is perfect for the job too, making him an ideal centre for the rest of this excellent ensemble cast. It’s a nice piece of vocal casting that Ross Ramgobin (pictured below, with Lauren Zolezzi as Patience) – dapper and droll as the more grounded, if equally vain Archibald Grosvenor – has a slightly richer, more sensuous voice; just as the slight signs of wear and tear on Andrew Slater’s baritone as Colonel Calverley befit an old soldier.In fact, this whole production is proof of the old truth that the more seriously you take Gilbert and Sullivan, the richer the comic rewards: you could feel the audience’s sympathy swinging behind Valerie Reed’s Lady Jane (that’ll happen when the director sends you on to sing your big Act Two aria carrying a double bass). Lauren Zolezzi plays Patience wide-eyed and utterly deadpan: all the funnier when Travis and Ramgobin swoon and fawn over her, or when in her dainty milkmaid’s frock she effortlessly lifts a massive milkchurn. And all the more affecting – and delicious – when her clear, firm soprano peals over Sullivan’s high notes and curls elegantly round the end of a phrase. Steel keeps the action smartly choreographed, with cast and chorus (lovesick maidens in pastel gowns like something out of Lord Leighton, Heavy Dragoons, pictured below, belting out their choruses with brilliant clarity) forming suitably picturesque tableaux on Florence de Maré’s William Morris-patterned arbour of a set, though there were moments when transitions between scenes might have been tighter. The maidens, too, could perhaps have used a slightly larger repertoire of languid gestures.But Sullivan has a way of disarming all reservations – and I’m not sure that even Iolanthe has more enchanting music. “The most beautiful score written for the English stage since Handel,” declares conductor Timothy Burke, and he conducts like he means it, too: bringing up the blackness of the basses in Bunthorne’s mock-tragic Act One confession, letting oboe counter-melodies soar weightlessly over vocal ensembles and making Sullivan’s exquisitely detailed accompaniments dance like gavottes. The orchestra responded with brightness and grace, reinforcing the sense that ETO has rediscovered a real treasure and presented it with affection and a winningly light touch. If Patience had a French name on the title page (and musically, it’s easily in the Chabrier class), it would be staged with huge fanfare (and budget to match) at Covent Garden. Let’s just be grateful that it doesn't. Patience is touring with Blanche McIntyre’s new production of Puccini's Tosca (Act One pictured above), and some early reviews were unkind, with Florence de Maré’s semi-abstract set coming in for particular flak. You can see why: the backdrop is midnight black throughout and the same obstacle course of grey latticed walkways and steps serves for all three acts, helped and occasionally hindered by Mark Howland’s lighting (a spotlight on Tosca for Vissi d’arte – come on now, seriously?). Actually, there’s far worse out there. De Maré’s set is at least as effective as Frank Philipp Schlössman’s designs for ENO’s lacklustre recent Tosca, and rather more consistent as a concept. It’s just that – however nimbly the cast negotiate it, and however effective it proves for staging big moments such as the Te Deum at the end of Act One, or Tosca’s final (and in this production, genuinely hair-raising) death leap – the presence of a massive trip hazard centre stage prompts thoughts of risk assessments rather than love and art. But with that proviso, what we saw at Wolverhampton Grand Theatre was a red-blooded Tosca with all the essentials very much in the right place, and in Paula Sides’s Floria Tosca (pictured above with Samuel Sakker) a performance of really compelling intensity. This is a woman who’s been wound up to breaking-point: Sides transforms in the flash of an eye from jealous spitfire to clingy young sweetheart, and her voice has a fierce, focused intensity that can snap, whip-like, from tremulous fragility to searchlight brilliance. She colours each word. Simultaneously girlishly impulsive and effortlessly sensuous, in her final scenes with Cavaradossi she was wide-eyed with euphoria: a woman who might perfectly credibly jump off a battlement. You wondered if Samuel Sakker's Cavaradossi knew exactly what he was dealing with – his wide-grained, dark-hued tenor wasn’t always matched by smooth phrasing, but his transition from the sunny young artist of Act One to brutalised, unbelieving victim in the final scenes was persuasive.ETO has double-cast the three principal roles, but Craig Smith (pictured above) appears as Scarpia in all but six performances. Tall, pale and harsh-featured (and really inhabiting de Maré’s greatcoated and jackbooted Napoleonic-era costume) he cuts a predatory figure: cruelty radiating from gimlet eyes. His vocal performance matches his appearance. Breathy, and occasionally breaking into a bark, it’s not the sonorous pitch-black singing we’ve come to expect from a Scarpia, but it never felt less than appropriate to this distinctly reptilian reading of the character. As is often the case with ETO, minor roles are cast from strength: Matthew Stiff’s bumbling, complacent Sacristan and Aled Hall’s uniformed pit-bull of a Spoletta were as characterfully acted as they were sung. Michael Rosewell conducted with headlong energy, finding colours – splashes of harp, snaking bassoon counterpoints – in the slightly reduced orchestration that can go unnoticed with plusher outfits (I don’t think I’ve ever heard the different bells of the Roman dawn sound quite so distinctive).Of course, with casts varying over ETO’s long tour, your experience may differ. And this isn’t a Tosca for WC2 canary fanciers. It’s Puccini in his natural element: built for big audiences and theatres of all sizes; fast, punchy, passionate and raw, and designed to grip a crowd like the incomparable thriller it is. It’s a tribute to McIntyre, Rosewell and their compulsively watchable cast that on this night, at least, it ended up doing quite a lot more than that.  @RichardBratby",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/patiencetosca-english-touring-opera,4

It’s always a dilemma for opera companies. Something lightweight, even comic, provides contrast but also risks trivialising Bartók’s dark, symbolist drama. Something equally brooding risks submerging the audience into an evening of endless gloom. For its collaboration with Glasgow-based experimental theatre company Vanishing Point, however, Scottish Opera has come up with a bold, ambitious solution: to pair Bluebeard’s Castle with a brand new piece, written expressly to complement it.The work in question is The 8th Door, created jointly by Scottish Opera’s composer in residence Lliam Paterson and Vanishing Point’s artistic director Matthew Lenton. And the combined result is an engrossing, often challenging evening that casts Bartók’s opera in a new and unusual light, and provides a provocative new context for its elusive symbolism.It’s hard to describe what The 8th Door actually is – maybe simply a 40-minute cantata by Paterson played and sung in the pit, while a staging by Lenton takes place up top. Certainly there are moments when those two worlds feel unconnected, simply happening to unfold at the same time. Yet at others they’re carefully choreographed together, the smallest actions finding parallels in Paterson’s music. It’s a beguiling effect.Paterson’s score, for five amplified voices and a large orchestra heavy on percussion, perhaps inevitably sounds a lot like Berio at times, especially his Sinfonia, and there are clear nods to Andriessen, Adams and others, too. But it’s a glittering, engrossing creation, sometimes frustrating in its swelling textures that simply dissipate, but thoroughly effective in its gradual transition from settings of love poems in English to a harsher-sounding Hungarian, leading us inexorably towards the dark psychodrama of Bartók’s opera after the interval. There might be a sense that Paterson – still only in his mid-20s – is still finding his individual voice, but there’s no doubting the strength and overall originality of his concept.Lenton’s stage counterpart (pictured above) couldn’t be simpler: two actors, sitting in front of video cameras, their faces projected live onto a giant screen at the back of the stage, tell an entirely wordless tale of flirtation, desire, tenderness, lust and disillusion. It’s carried off superbly by performers Elicia Daly and Robert Jack, who convey the couple’s fragile tenderness with aching honesty, and just when you think there’s little to link pit and stage, a blink or a turn of the head will summon a cascading climax or glitter of percussion. Most importantly, it set up Bluebeard beautifully: here, we’re perhaps seeing the real-world characters behind Bartók’s archetypes, or maybe the opera is an earlier relationship under examination. It’s simple, but it works a treat.And first-time opera director Lenton has come up with a wonderfully simple concept for his thoughtful staging of Bluebeard’s Castle, too. We’re in a normal modern flat – with just one rather than the libretto’s seven doors – but Judith’s exhortations that her new lover fling open his portals to let in the light trigger chaotic transformations to the interior’s tidy order: flowers and tendrils sprout from the furniture; a flurry of gold dust hints at his wealth; and in a staging masterstroke, designer Kai Fischer's immaculate set fragments to reveal the expanse of Bluebeard’s lands beyond.Not everything works: the sudden plunge into grand guignol with the appearance of Bluebeard’s former wives, and its sudden lurch into literalism, strikes a perplexing note after the subtlety and suggestion of the rest of the staging. But it’s a powerful, beautifully considered concept all the same.And it’s carried along by breathtaking performances from Bluebeard veteran Robert Hayward (pictured above) and Karen Cargill as Judith on phenomenally strong form, her voice clear, crisp and golden, her characterisation flickering restlessly between power, vulnerability, even coquettishness. Her Judith feels truly alive, a long way from an empty symbol. Hayward is equally vibrant as Bluebeard, endlessly patient with his new lover’s demands, pitched between imposing power and weary vulnerability.They get solid support from Sian Edwards and Scottish Opera’s orchestra in the pit, who are supple and sensuous throughout the evening, and full of bristling detail in Paterson’s demanding score. Their performance could sometimes do with a little more raw power, even if supplementary brass make a sudden appearance in boxes either side of the stage for Bartók’s biggest climax.Pairing Bluebeard with a newly devised piece was a bold, risky endeavour from Scottish Opera. The result, though, is a magnificent achievement – not without its faults, certainly, but just the kind of challenging, boundary-pushing work that Scottish Opera is increasingly moving into, and should be congratulated on.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/bluebeards-castle-8th-door-scottish-opera,4
134,"Madama Butterfly, Royal Opera",Madama Butterfly,Royal Opera,2017-03-31,David Nice,"""È un'immensa pietà"" - ""it's heartbreaking,"" rather than ""it's a huge pity"" - sings consul Sharpless of ""Butterfly"" Cio-Cio San's fatal belief that her American husband will return to her. Heartbreak is what we expected from Ermonela Jaho after her lacerating performances as Puccini's Suor Angelica at the Royal Opera and Leoncavallo's Zazà at the Barbican, and heartbreak is what we got in the most nuanced of interpretations. How much richer it was, though, in perfect accord with Antonio Pappano, who knows and conducts this most beautiful and, ultimately, most devastating of scores better than anyone alive.Perfection rests in the close-on 90 minute shape of Act Two, charting the hopes, dreams and mental torture of the deserted Japanese child bride; without Pappano's perfect sense of pace and colour, it wouldn't have come across as the supreme operatic achievement it is. Jaho uses all the colour at her disposal, too; having kept the tone mostly light but never falsely girlish for the wedding and love scene of Act One - essentially a prologue - she can be womanly and even grande dame-ish towards rich suitor Yamadori, as well as revealing a core of steel which will serve her at the end and a searing line in the desperate will to believe. I'm sure that the close-ups of the livescreening would have added to the emotional impact; from the Amphitheatre it's hard to see facial nuance.""Un bel di"" (""One fine day"") starts luminously soft, and unfolds as the great visionary monologue it is - a private meditation, despite the presence of maid Suzuki. The silence before it was one of many which spoke volumes in a way that I've never encountered here before; and lines on the cusp of it were just as moving as the more dramatic moments. How piercing were the lines ""I'm no longer what I was. These lips have breathed too many sighs...and these eyes have gaze too hard into the distance"", wind and string chords mesmerisingly soft against them, as Butterfly prepares the vigil for Pinkerton's return (Elizabeth DeShong, Harry Langton and Jaho pictured above). It's one of many scenes where directos Moshe Leiser and Patrice Caurier respect the simplicity of the original stage directions (I've always like the scenes behind the panels, though last night the lighting went awry from time to time, maybe to do with the livescreening). If Butterfly, Suzuki and the child could be seen sitting there during the interlude as well as an exquisite ""Humming Chorus"", the tension would be perfectly maintained; as it is, a dropcloth to prepare for the dawn cues audience fidgeting before the drama is reasserted. Better that, though, than the disastrous interval in the Minghella production for ENO.Adding to the devastation of Butterfly's predicament is the Suzuki of Elizabeth DeShong, possibly the most opulent mezzo we've had in the role, with a wonderful contralto extension in the lower range, and a sympathetic presence. The men are less good, as too often. Argentinian tenor Marcelo Puente (pictured above right with Scott Hendricks) looks the part of the callow American naval officer, but with the bleat in the voice belies Pinkerton's dash: this is a sheep in wolf's clothing, and though the raw material is promising, the dodgy technique suggests imminent burn-out if it isn't sorted soon. Puente is no more comfortable than most tenors with Pinkerton's burning ardour to deflower his 15-year-old child bride.Scott Hendricks, the perfect young Verdi baritone when I saw him as Rodrigo in a Cologne Don Carlo back in the 1990s, hasn't aged well vocally. Jette Parker artist Gyula Nagy, singing the brief role of the Imperial Commissioner, might have made a better Sharpless; it's surely one of the few Italian baritone roles that can be safely entrusted to an apprentice singer. Former Jette Parker singer Yuriy Yurchuk as Yamadori and Carlo Bosi's Goro also showed more vocal security than the two male principals. But ultimately it's Butterfly and the exquisite-to-cruel colours in which Puccini, the master-orchestrator, paints her, that make the opera, and in this respect a great score has rarely been better served. The similarly committed Ana María Martínez should impress, too, when she takes over from Jaho on 13 April for four performances.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/madama-butterfly-royal-opera-1,4
135,"Alceste, Early Opera Company, Curnyn, Wigmore Hall",Alceste,Early Opera Company,2017-03-30,David Nice,"A wife dies to save her husband; a hero goes to hell and back to retrieve her from the underworld. Nothing of this dark myth, other than a rollicking row across the Styx from a bass singing Charon, ferryman of the dead, remains in Handel's incidental music to Alceste, a play on the subject by Tobias Smollett (of Roderick Random fame) which never reached a putatively extravagant Covent Garden staging and which has vanished from sight. Instead we have a masque-like score in which the principle characters don't sing. In the company of an inventive little serenade by Boyce and a great Concerto grosso, it gave us an evening of ""endless pleasure, endless love"" under the ever-stylish guidance of Christian Curnyn.With his Early Opera Company, he's already recorded the Alceste music, adding a couple of numbers from two of the operas – one from Admeto, Handel's Italian setting of the Alceste legend, the other a Passacaglia from Radamisto to give a scene in the Elysian fields some body. Neither appeared last night, while both chorus and orchestra were reduced in size. No problem with any of that; the two-per-part chorus, including the soloists, was perfect, and to sit for the first time ever at the back of the upstairs gallery was to hear the gutsy, spirited sound pinging off the wooden panelling behind (note: this may be the best place to be in the entire Wigmore Hall). And the first half plums were so generous that there was no need of an artificially extended second-half divertissement.In the Concerto grosso Op. 6 No. 1, ripieno soloists Catherine Martin and Oliver Webber gave a spirited lead to the small but meaty string ensemble – a very different sound to the airy elegance Curnyn is currently extracting from the ENO Orchestra in a peerless Partenope, though feminine endings were certainly not in short supply throughout the evening. Oboes gave a further sheen in unison with the strings for excerpts from Boyce's Solomon, a serenata whose simple pastoral ""He""/""She"" exchanges gave no hint of any reason for the title.No matter; there were surprises here. First came the inflections word-sensitive tenor Benjamin Hulett, singing of ""He""'s ""fair and comely"" love, brought to Boyce's surprise setting of ""the accents wound"". Then there were the two trumpets – gleaming, note-perfect David Hendry and David Carstairs – bringing a special radiance to the fizzing soprano aria, and the dark colours of the ""southern breeze"" in the last number before the choral entry.Anything Boyce can do, though, Handel can do even better. His ceremonial ""Grande Entrée"" for Admetus and Alceste, also trumpet-bright, has extraordinary downward and upward rushing scales. Of the choruses, the opening figure of the repeated ""Thrice happy"" is both memorable and interestingly distributed among the parts. Hulett showed flawless brilliance in fast runs, matched for character by James Platt's one appearance as feisty Charon. Mary Bevan (pictured right by Tina Haldane) charmed in the kind of Morpheus number which by 1749 Handel could do, if you'll forgive the phrase under the circumstances, in his sleep: it's pretty, but lacks the depth a really great aria can give to a single act of a Handel opera.Yet this, after all, was only a pair of ceremonials for the outer acts of the projected grand drama. One soprano more might have brought greater range; the younger of the talented Bevan sisters is impeccable in her musicianship, but a tad more cut would have brought off a duel with Handel's staggering writing for strings in ""Come, Fancy"" more effectively. That takes a diva of the first order like Lucy Crowe on the Chandos recording. Still, the pleasure flowed uninterrupted: just the tonic, in the form of numbers in English by a German-born composer on a Greek subject, at the end of a dark day.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music-opera/alceste-early-opera-company-curnyn-wigmore-hall,4
136,"Ormisda, St George's Hanover Square",Ormisda,St George's Hanover Square,2017-03-29,alexandra Coghlan,"The annual London Handel Festival is dutifully working its way through every one of Handel’s operas in a cycle that will eventually take us from Alcina to Xerxes before, presumably, starting all over again. But each year, alongside these headliners, we also get a pasticcio – an opera stitched together by Handel from the shiniest and most decorative musical scraps by his European colleagues. It’s these unknown works that often throw up the biggest surprises, giving us a wide-shot of a broader musical landscape now all but obliterated by Handel’s popularity.The term ""pasticcio"" originally meant pie or pastry, and like its namesake a good operatic pasticcio requires plenty of musical meat. Ormisda positively overflows with it; melodically it’s one of the most generous of all the works Handel assembled, and the combination of arias by Hasse, Vinci, Leo, Orlandini and Giacomelli was such a hit with audiences of the 1730 season that it received a massive 14 performances. (To put that in context, Giulio Cesare ran for just 13 nights.)Nearly 300 years later it’s still a winning formula, especially when performed by the ever-stylish band of Opera Settecento under Leo Duarte, and as exciting a line-up of young soloists as I’ve ever heard at the festival, including at least two recent Handel Singing Competition finalists.It’s possible that the plot of Ormisda really isn’t all that complicated, but with no surtitles and only a grainy facsimile of the original 18th century word-book for help, I can’t have been the only one struggling. The gist seems to be as follows: Ormisda, the Persian King, wishes to pass the rule of his kingdom to his eldest son Cosroe, and with it the hand of Artenice in marriage. But he reckons without her love for his younger son Arsace and his own scheming second wife Palmira, who both conspire against it.The plot is, of course, only a structure on which to hang a selection of arias, and these included some real gems. Orlandini was the dark horse of the composers, contributing not only Palmira’s effortlessly graceful “Nel tuo amor” but also Ormisda’s rippling “Si, si, lasciatemi”, while Leo’s single vengeance aria for Arsace “Tuona il ciel” provided a wonderful showpiece for mezzo Maria Ostroukhova. But it’s always Hasse who dominates, proving himself every bit Handel’s equal here with Artenice’s glorious “Passaggier che in selva oscura” and Palmira’s fiery “Se qual cor”.A finalist in the festival’s 2015 singing competition, Ostroukhova has since matured both dramatically and technically, and evolved into an assured perfomer whose dark lower register opens up into real brilliance at the top. Her Arsace smouldered and schemed with charisma, playing off the ingenuous manipulations of Ciara Hendrick’s sweetly sung Palmira. Soprano Marie Lys (another Handel Competition alumna, pictured above) grew in strength and ease as the evening progressed, spinning some lovely legatos in her two Hasse arias. Tom Verney (Cosroe) is the latest in a series of exciting young countertenors to come through the festival, making as much of this rather flaccid nice-guy role as possible, and Nicholas Mogg offered strong support as henchman Erismeno. Only John-Colyn Gyeantey’s Ormisda missed the mark a little, tending closer to Bellini than baroque in his crooning, Italianate delivery.Bring on next year’s performance of Venceslao.@AlexaCoghlan",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/ormisda-st-georges-hanover-square,4
137,"The First Commandment, Classical Opera, St John’s Smith Square",The First Commandment,Classical Opera,2017-03-22,Peter Quantrill,"Isn’t it funny? You wait ages for an opera by an eleven-year-old and then two turn up at once. The world’s feature journalists descended on Vienna at Christmas for a new take on Cinderella by Alma Deutscher. What they heard, for what it’s worth, was a precocious, glittery pastiche of Classical manners. Last night was the real deal. Die Schuldigkeit des Ersten Gebots, by Mozart: ""The Obligation to Keep the First Commandment"". Not a title to make the heart beat faster, is it? Ian Page and his increasingly prominent Classical Opera company commissioned Nigel Lewis for a snappy new English translation which duly drops the imperative. Obligations aren’t much in fashion these days.Revivals of obscure Baroque sacred dramas, however, very much are. Scarcely a month goes by without a modern premiere of an earnest sequence of recitatives and arias by Draghi, Durante or even someone you’ve heard of. The First Commandment fits right in. Indeed even at that age, it’s clear that Mozart had little to learn from his elders and already a few things to show them, notably in the way of orchestration. There was nothing that his father Leopold could teach him in the way of technique, as Stanley Sadie remarked in his late work on early Mozart; only maturity and experience were lacking. Page has observed that Leopold’s diligent work on the manuscript is limited largely to correcting typos and adding page numbers.By now Page surely knows the piece better than anyone else, ever, including the composer. With a 2014 recording of the German original under their belts, the Classical Opera players were unfailingly polished in music with an often surprising richness of inner-part detail. Greater familiarity with similar work by the sons of Bach – especially Johann Christian, whom the child Mozart had met in London – would doubtless refine appreciation of templates he may have used for the seven, expansive da capo arias and concluding terzet, and Page certainly sharpened contrasts of mood and tempo to pep up what might otherwise lapse into a lukewarm sequence of pieties.Not even the brains of JC or CPE Bach, however, had conceived of an aria with obbligato trombone. With a theatrical maturity far beyond his years, Mozart made it the centrepiece of the work: a testament of doubt and tentative faith on the part of the Christian who wavers between claims made on behalf of God and Mammon. This was sung with notable control and a steady, sympathetic tone by the tenor Alessandro Fisher, who bore little trace of the bronchitis for which apologies had been offered – and who was no less nobly partnered by Stephanie Dyer on a “period” alto trombone.There were no weak links among the five singers. The meat of the work falls to the more baritonal tenor of Sam Furness, got up as a Kilvert-style parson in an unfussily effective, Classical-era staging by Thomas Guthrie for the limited space available at St John’s. Gemma Summerfield (as Compassion) and Helen Sherman as (Justice) made much of their rather truncated roles, inevitably ceding attention to the well-judged diva antics and slightly brittle coloratura of Rebecca Bottone (pictured above) as a Worldly Spirit worthy of Thackeray’s Becky Sharp.Much fun can be had spotting the ideas that lodged in Mozart’s head and came out again in unexpected places. The mise-en-scène of Così fan tutte, for example; even the trombone solo in the Requiem. But Schuldigkeit is an unmixed pleasure of its own. Go tonight if you can.  @peterquantrill",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/first-commandment-classical-opera-st-john%E2%80%99s-smith-square,4
138,"Partenope, English National Opera",Partenope,English National Opera,2017-03-16,David Nice,"It's time again for surrealist charades at the nothing-doing mansion. Christopher Alden's Handel is back at ENO, making inconsequentiality seem wondrous. Christian Curnyn's conducting sets the tone, with orchestral playing as light as air, and a new cast – with one singer from the previous set switching roles – conceals its art behind what seems like the easiest and most organic of singing and acting.What a relief it is after aimless shenanigans over at the Royal Opera to return to a production that's so sure- (and light-) footed. No one should grumble about the frivolous setting when Handel's cod-mythological pretext, the conflict between Neapolitan founder-queen Parthenope and her loving enemy Emilio, Prince of Cumae, is entirely at the service of an amorous tangle which stretches itself out, with little plot-interest, over three nominally long acts. Amanda Holden's witty translation keeps the battle references, but is full of spiffing 1920s colloquialisms.What better location for this bagatelle than an absurdist house party, manipulated by Emilio as Man Ray? In which role a late replacement for tenor Robert Murray, house singer Rupert Charlesworth (pictured above in Nosferatu mode), absolutely dazzles with a firm, full voice offering impressive agility and footwork to match. Not quite so sure about his last manifestation as a camp guru, but that suggests there's room for a Mapp and Lucia-style Handel production if there hasn't already been one (for those of you who remember the ""Indian visitor"" to Tilling).You might argue that there are a couple of shimmies too many, but the technique of evolving business over an infinite number of da capo arias has been a challenge since Nicholas Hytner first did it in the now-legendary ENO Xerxes. Christopher's brother David Alden made it all a bit heavy-hearted in his Ariodante; Robert Carsen's Semele was a vision, David McVicar pulled it off at even greater length than this in a delicious Agrippina. Nobody in this cast falls short of the impressive physical demands. As one of Partenope's three suitors, the foppish Armindo, counter-tenor James Laing tumbles down the gorgeous white spiral staircase and hangs from it while singing with spot-on accuracy (pictured below). Later he's asked to execute a double act with a spotlight, which he does with aplomb.The three bristling arias which power the first half of Act Two all have star turns, revue-style, crowned by Parthenope's cabaret act with top hat and chair. Sarah Tynan (pictured below) is consummate, and ravishing to behold in her outer-act 1920s couture, even if some of her subtleties would carry better in a smaller house like Glyndebourne (or the original Garsington, where the goings-on of Lady Ottoline Morrell and Lytton Strachey seem to be suggested by Tynan and game Matthew Durkan as her effete sidekick Ormonte). And the scene where she's asked to light a fire in an old stove to parallel the flames of Cupid she's singing about and settles down to sleep beside it is the one point where you feel the action is a tad contrived.If there's real emotion to be found here, it comes in Act Three with the big aria and ""sleep"" number of suitor Arsace, in which the lustrous contralto of the ever-dependable Patricia Bardon comes to the fore. First time round, she played  Arsace's lover Rosmira, disguised as yet another androgynous gentleman in pursuit of the man she loves. That role is now taken by Stephanie Windsor-Lewis, who fits into the ensemble as well as anyone.True, there are always times when those of us who are never going to be hardcore Handelians find our thoughts elsewhere – my companion pointed out that his original audience would have expected to chatter through whole chunks. But Alden and his team always pull us back into focus, hugely assisted by the superb sets of Andrew Lieberman, costumes by Jon Morrell and chameleonic lighting from Adam Silverman, revived here by Kevin Sleep (much-missed Claire Glaskin's nimble movement is resurrected by Elaine Brown). Whether deliciously inconsequential Handel is your glass of champagne or not, this is that rare thing in the opera house, the total work of art.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/partenope-english-national-opera,4
139,"Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, Royal Opera",Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg,Royal Opera,2017-03-12,David Nice,"Recent British-based productions have taken Wagner's paean to creativity, the reconciliation of tradition and the individual talent, at face value. Graham Vick's long-serving Covent Garden colourfest, with its brilliant staging of the night brawl; David McVicar's sunny Biedermeier celebration at Glyndebourne; best of all, Richard Jones, making Wagner's immaculate all-about-art proposals crystal clear first for Welsh and then for English National Operas: all three have had their share of joy and lightness. Not so Kasper Holten's semi-mess of a show, which is nothing to laugh about at any point.The darker than usual ending isn't the problem. Harder to take are the vagueness with which the crucial human relationships are sketched and the botched topography of a second act which is the clumsiest realisation of anything I’ve seen on an operatic stage since Katharina Thoma’s Royal Opera Un ballo in maschera. So much the worse given a cast which, on paper at least, looked close to perfect - three of the principals, the great Bryn Terfel included, have passed their tests with flying colours in previous productions infinitely better than this one - and conducting by Antonio Pappano which, if it sometimes lacks a certain amplitude, certainly has plenty of the grace, drive and suppleness Holten's leaden-footed vision so catastrophically lacks.If you're going to throw out the four settings Wagner envisaged - a church doubling as a morning meeting-place for artistic guildsmen, a balmy midsummer evening in a city square, a cobbler's humble abode and festive water-meadows in bright sunlight (the alternative pictured above) - you'd better find something convincing with which to replace them. It's not immediately clear that Holten has failed in the task: within Mia Stensgaard’s theatre or civic building, richly wooded but in ungainly 1970s style design, a choral group are rehearsing under the watchful eye of Mastersinger Hans Sachs. It could be communist Eastern Europe until outsider Walther appears in grubby contemporary get-up.“Apprentice” David’s explanation of the song-rules to this contender for the hand of the goldsmith’s daughter – though excellently delivered in high musical style by Allan Clayton, surely a Walther in the making with a timbre not dissimilar to the present, vocally tireless incumbent, Gwyn Hughes Jones – takes place to waiters and waitresses mugging horribly as they set up tables for the “club members”. Where Jones illustrated the song-types entertainingly, Holten clearly doesn’t trust this sequence and it’s back to otiose exposition as usual. The Mastersingers appear in Masonic aprons, complete with (ungreeted) trophy wives. To judge from this, and the photos of civic UK ceremonies in the programme’s centrefold obviously advised by Holten, a central point is missed: that for all their innate conservatism, the practitioners are working men who really care about the meaning of art, not just about hollow ceremonials. Artistic, all the same, are the considered Pogner of Stephen Milling and Sebastian Holeck's clarion Kothner.You have a queasy feeling that Act 2 isn’t going to deliver on the perfumed summer night airs and blossom-scent rife in Wagner's score. Sure enough, we’re stuck in the theatre, with a bit of ominous dry ice and two lilac “trees” in pots having to make do as the context for Sachs’s great monologue. It’s soulfully sung, as at Welsh National Opera, by Terfel, albeit in generally more declamatory mode but with real artistry aided by Pappano in the throbbing-horn coda. Yet the stage picture needs to be in complicity with Sachs. It isn't. There are no cobbler’s or goldsmith’s houses either side of the stage, of course, no balcony from which maid Magdalene (Hanna Hipp, excellent) can impersonate her mistress, and Sachs happens to have brought his work with him.Johannes Martin Kränzle (pictured above with Terfel), so funny as malicious pedant and rival suitor Beckmesser for McVicar at Glyndebourne, does his shtick at a harpsichord, not with a lute, getting only a few titters, though later he manages pathos well; Hughes Jones, stuck up the steps and out of sight for many people in the audience with his Eva for much of the act, resorts to an angry rasping which makes him more a third Nibelung brother for Mime and Alberich rather than an impetuous young man. The tenor overacts, while Terfel keeps movement to a minimum; his Sachs can never have less than star quality, but how much more of a real person he was at WNO. The brawl is an unspeakable mess: a seething costume pageant, not a fight, giving Sachs nothing to react to over human folly in the Third Act other than a quick flick of newspaper.Act 3 Scene 1, set backstage on a slow revolve, allows more focus on relationships, but the love-triangle between Sachs, Eva and Walther is botched, not least when she kisses first the older and then the younger man on the lips. Rachel Willis-Sørensen (pictured below with Terfel), a golden-toned Marschallin in the second Royal Opera Rosenkavalier cast, isn’t the light lyric soprano required for Eva in the first two acts, but she comes into her own for the rhapsodic salute to Sachs – the point where all previous Evas I’ve seen have been suddenly overtaxed – and leads the best, because stillest, moment in the evening, a golden Quintet.The song festival isn’t much fun from the start; the guild parades and the dance sequences are cramped and undeserving of the ecstatic applause of the onstage crowd in evening dress. Kränzle’s Beckmesser botches well, Hughes Jones soars to win the prize, but when Terfel’s Sachs tells him to accept it, integrate with tradition and respect “Holy German Art”, someone isn’t happy. It would actually be a spoiler to reveal all, since to my surprise Holten’s alternative take on the nationalism which Wagner belatedly – and, in most people’s eyes, mistakenly – injected into his warm romantic comedy really does work on its own terms, even if it's a bit of a volte face for this Sachs. Pappano compels the orchestra and chorus to reflect it too, turning genial ritual brutal at the last minute (you can do the same to Beethoven’s Ninth).Ultimately, then, I’m glad that critical duty alone prevented me from bolting like said character, and much earlier, after the direst part of an often enervating evening. Funny how a good production and high musical values can save an uninspiring score (Ryan Wigglesworth’s The Winter’s Tale at ENO); while bad direction can almost sink a musically superlative performance. It's a sad end to Holten's regime as Director of Opera, which began well with Eugene Onegin, faltered on the side of his own stagings but achieved good things on many other fronts. Advice: catch this Meistersinger on the radio, though you'll have wait until June.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/die-meistersinger-von-n%C3%BCrnberg-royal-opera-0,2
140,"The Winter's Tale, English National Opera",The Winter's Tale,English National Opera,2017-02-28,David Nice,"After a Royal Opera performance of Birtwistle's The Minotaur, a friend spotted Hans Werner Henze in the foyer and had the temerity to ask that annoying question ""What did you think?"" ""Very competent and extremely well performed,"" came the reply. Which is the measure of Ryan Wigglesworth's Shakespeare adaptation at ENO. Every UK premiere of a new British opera can be sure of one thing -  a first-rate cast of English-speaking singers. Perhaps the real surprise here was the debut of that great actor Rory Kinnear as a director: clear and sure-footed throughout.Clarity is a quality, too, of Wigglesworth's score. His libretto, certainly, is a masterly job of Shakespearean compression, some 20 pages of text telescoping many sentiments but keeping some of the most poetically hard-hitting lines as we move from the harsh, wintry kingdom of Leontes to the spring fairy-tale of Polixenes's Bohemia 16 years later and back to reckoning and recognition. But always beware a composer who talks of ""taking on a sound-world"". Timbre and colour are vital components, of course, but when they're foregrounded at the expense of variety in musical and harmonic language or careful dramatic delineation of various characters, the result is bound to be limited. This is a parallel if not aurally similar world to George Benjamin's hugely over-rated Written on Skin, fascinating in its instrumental colour but low on dramatic pace (though in this case at least the structure is dictated by Shakespeare).Wigglesworth the Second - as we have to call him now that his namesake Mark Wigglesworth has left the ENO's Oval Office, though Ryan's conducting seems to have come on since I last heard him and lends conviction to agony - is hampered by his post-Berg-and-Mahler narrowness (and those two composers were always dramatically various and sure-footed, of course, in opera and symphony). One descending figure - think Wozzeck's ""Ah, Marie!"" - is all you'll take away from Act One: when the stakes are angsty from the start, and remain so for Hermione's brief nursery idyll with Paulina and Mamiilius, there's nowhere for Leontes' motiveless jealousy to go. Iain Paterson (pictured above with Timothy Robinson, left, as Camillo) conveys it with marvellous economy and bleakness, but the vocal lines, as in Adès, are unrewarding. There's some half-effective stuff for the chorus, shouting justice for the maligned Hermione and results from Apollo's oracle, but the orchestral interludes are unvaried in their tortuousness.The real test was going to be whether Wigglesworth could conjure a different world for Hermione's and Leontes's teenage daughter as Bohemian shepherdess and her wooing by a disguised Prince Florizel. He doesn't, in terms of musical language, even if the sounds are more ethereal. Samantha Price and Anthony Gregory (pictured below with the ENO Chorus) charm with very limited material; I suppose it's a mercy we don't get a ""hey nonny nonny"" divertissement, but this is where a popular, mood-sensitive composer like Joby Talbot, in his music for the Royal Ballet's fitfully very effective take on The Winter's Tale, can give us all the relief we need. Once again, when Polixenes' spoken explosion at his son's behaviour arrives - and it's vehemently delivered by the ever committed Leigh Melrose - it has no real contrasts to fight against.Back in ""Sicilia"", Wigglesworth does capture the glacial strangeness of the crucial Hermione-as-statue scene; Susan Bickley as Paulina at last gets a chance to exercise her formidable presence and authority, while Sophie Bevan's high-line act - again, under-engaged in Act One - caps the miracle. Where Wigglesworth excels is in stripping down orchestral textures so that one or two solo instruments or two - clarinets, a double-bass with Leontes, a ravishing flute solo - focus the magic, But the denouement would have been so much more effective if it came out of contrasts.That said, Kinnear - whose programme article is much more flavoursome than Wigglesworth's - never puts a foot wrong, and if his Bohemian scene, over-compressed in the opera, doesn't go wild on vernal contrast, that's in keeping with the same-y musical style. Leontes is a bemedalled dictator in a neoclassical hall of statues - that keeps the Apollo references and the mythmaking pertinent - while Polixenes seems bent on similar autocracy over the seas. Kinnear doesn't labour the point he makes in the programme about ""a capricious ruler, easily provoked, fatally proud, appalling in his treatment of women, ignorant of the natural world, quick to throw up barriers between his own and a neighbouring country"", but the thought does enter our heads.Kinnear is wrong about one thing in that note: there is another ""major operatic version"" of The Winter's Tale, Philippe Boesmans', preserved in a fine recording from Brussels' La Monnaie conducted by Antonio Pappano. A worthier candidate for his attentions, perhaps; but that said, this will certainly merit at least one revival by virtue of its fine team and a story simply if monotonously told. Next, though, let Kinnear loose on the other Shakespearean romances for which he declares his special love: this is one actor who really does have the objectivity and the style to be a top director.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/winters-tale-english-national-opera,4
141,"Hansel and Gretel, Opera North",Hansel and Gretel,Opera North,2017-02-27,graham Rickson,"Opera North’s updated version of Humperdinck’s Hansel and Gretel takes place in what looks like a down-at-heel Leeds housing estate, the titular siblings shown filming the story using simple domestic props and back projections. Quite how the impoverished pair have acquired a high-end video camera isn’t made clear; presumably the assorted boxes of Christmas decorations scattered around Giles Cadel’s spare set fell off the back of the same lorry. This Hansel and Gretel is overstuffed with musical delights, but Edward Dick’s production often wilfully obscures and complicates what should be an ideal first opera; under-tens reading the synopsis might have difficulty matching salient plot points with what they see on stage.Sensibly it’s sung in English, using David Pountney’s witty rhyming translation. Surtitles are provided, though clear diction makes them largely unnecessary. There are some magical moments: the journey through the forest is realised with the simplest of means, and a gingerbread cottage is conjured up by pointing the camera inside a well-stocked fridge (below left). Nestlé’s Caramac and Fry’s Turkish Delight play prominent roles.Amy Freston’s fresh-voiced Dew Fairy (pictured right) wafts a can of air freshener over the sleeping pair. Elsewhere it’s all a bit needlessly odd; the dream-pantomime becomes an extended silent film showing the children escaping to a seaside B&B with a friendly granny, and a tonally jarring epilogue seems to be set in the 1970s.After an underwhelming first half, everything suddenly springs to life in Act 3, largely due to the presence of Susan Bullock as the Witch, a terrifying vision in fur coat and sunglasses. She’s terrific, an adrenalin shot in human form. Her performance is just hammy enough, simultaneously funny and terrifying. First spotted peering through a window, she bursts in to catch Katie Bray’s Hansel and Fflur Wyn’s Gretel greedily wolfing down a sponge cake. Bullock towers over them; you suspect that she’d happily devour them raw. The neatest update is her substitution of an electric whisk for a magic wand. Rarely has a kitchen implement seemed so menacing.Watching Bullock force feeding an immobilised Hansel with uncooked cake mixture is worth the ticket price alone. She stamps, snarls and spits, and it’s difficult not to cheer when Hansel literally gives her the finger. Her demise, a fiery annihilation in a domestic gas oven is a moment to savour, though the ensuing resurrection of the gingerbread children doesn’t move as it should. Supporting roles are well cast; Stephen Gadd’s gruff Peter is a standout, and the children’s chorus sing beautifully. Orchestrally it’s excellent; the young German conductor Christoph Altstaedt conjures ravishing sonorities from an on-form orchestra, the players audibly reaping the benefits of five years' exposure to the music of Wagner.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/hansel-and-gretel-opera-north,3
142,"Juan Diego Flórez, Vincenzo Scalera, Symphony Hall, Birmingham",Juan Diego Flórez,Vincenzo Scalera,2017-02-22,Richard Bratby,"“Who says Mozart is not like Rossini?” remarked Juan Diego Flórez, about a quarter of an hour into his debut recital at Symphony Hall. “There are seven high Cs in this aria.” And with a flicker of notes from the pianist Vincenzo Scalera, he was off into ""Vado incontro"", from Mitridate by the 14-year old Mozart. He wasn’t joking, either. You could count each of those Cs as they burst – the ultimate sonic weapon in the arsenal of the superstar tenor.There was no question of them sounding unforced; perhaps, no possibility. Phrasing went by the board as one after another they flashed out. The sensation, for anyone trying to make dramatic sense of it all, was like being tailgated by a Ferrari whose driver keeps flicking their headlights onto full beam: startling, dazzling, faintly intimidating. Musical? You’re missing the point. Plus, the audience loved it and they were out in force (never a given for a song recital in Birmingham). Flórez’s magnetism precedes him, and in his blue suit, black bow tie and patent leather shoes, he cut an engaging figure – leaning against the piano, clasping one arm against his chest, and apologising politely to the front rows as he popped off stage for another sip of water.A blaze of bel canto fireworks brought the stalls to their feetFinding a persuasive musical vehicle for all that charm was a problem that eluded this concert at least as far as the interval. The Symphony Hall acoustic makes pretty much anything sound good, but it can’t generate the drawing-room intimacy that Rossini’s late salon songs (for all their tendency to punch for the stars in the final verse) really need. And without the cushioning of a full orchestra, display arias from Mozart’s Die Entführung and Rossini’s Semiramide didn’t land easily on the ear. Scalera summoned up orchestral textures with considerable flair, but not enough to conceal occasional wooliness and a certain coarseness of tone in Flórez’s passagework. Flórez's high notes are a phenomenon, no question. They just didn't sound very nice.With the second half, the emphasis changed from bel canto to verismo, and that worked quite a lot better. A trio of parlour songs by Leoncavallo dispensed almost completely with vocal fireworks: Flórez was able to shape long, curving musical lines and drape his glowing middle register sensuously over the words. Combined with Scalera’s limpid, eloquent pianism this felt like real chamber music. And counter-intuitively enough, the absence of an orchestra seemed to matter noticeably less in extracts from Puccini’s Gianni Schicchi (Rinuccio’s great hymn to the city of Florence) and La Bohème (""Che gelida manina"") and Massenet’s Werther (""Pourquoi me réveiller""), as Flórez slipped into character, revealing the attractive tonal shade that complements that brilliant light, colouring individual words and, for the first time in the evening, achieving some truly rapt pianos.Chunks of Verdi (I Lombardi and Traviata) ended the rather short official programme, and then the fun really started. Flórez singing “something in English” – the old Mario Lanza favourite ""Be My Love"", sung from an iPad (“I can’t always remember the words” he explained, smiling), and hammed up with exuberant glee. Flórez without Scalera, strumming a guitar in two Mexican popular songs, one of which was ""Besame Mucho"", and both of which were sung with an unaffected gentleness and warmth that held the hall breathlessly silent. And finally, one last blaze of unannounced bel canto fireworks to bring a good two thirds of the stalls to their feet. Flowers were placed on the stage and a little boy handed a beaming Flórez a toy Paddington Bear (well, they’re both from Peru, after all). The warmth in the room was overwhelming. Star quality, clearly, is something other than simply a flawless voice. @RichardBratby",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music-opera/juan-diego-fl%C3%B3rez-vincenzo-scalera-symphony-hall-birmingham,4
143,"Le Vin herbé, Welsh National Opera",Le Vin herbé,Welsh National Opera,2017-02-17,stephen Walsh,"Wagner’s Tristan left a huge mark on fin de siècle art, on the symbolist poets, even on their pseudonyms; Debussy himself toyed with a four-act opera on the subject. And his version, if he had ever composed it, would have been an intriguing precedent for the Swiss composer Frank Martin’s Le Vin herbé (The Drugged Wine), since both are, or would have been, derived from the same source, Joseph Bédier’s turn-of-the-century novel, Le Roman de Tristan et Isaut, a much more detailed and anecdotal conflation of the various medieval legends than Wagner’s.Martin’s so-called Oratorio profane (1938-41) was not composed for the stage and has seldom found its way there, at least in this country. But Polly Graham’s new production for Welsh National Opera shows, among other things, that the hour-and-three-quarters piece is both stage-worthy and, in its own fashion, distinctly dramatic.True, it goes out of its way to avoid the normal apparatus of operatic drama. Scored for a tiny orchestra of solo strings and piano, and with most of the vocal solos supplied by singers stepping out of the chorus, it studiously rejects theatre and characterisation in the normal sense. Only Tristan and Iseult (Martin’s spelling) are consistent portraits from start to finish. The text is mainly a poetic narrative, told by the chorus, and the form is a mosaic of brief tableaux, twenty in all, a sort of child-adult’s home theatrical, but surprisingly intense as a whole, and in the end subtly moving.It would be hard to imagine a more perfect musical performanceMartin’s score is exquisite and effective, even if a shade too long for its somewhat limited harmonic and instrumental palette. Something of Wagner remains, though refracted through Schoenberg’s serialism. But the sensibility is entirely French, with occasional shades of Debussy’s Pelléas in certain harmonic archaisms and the discreet, speech-like setting of the text. I thought it a pity that WNO decided to sing it in English, which lies less well on the music and to some extent betrays the poetic quality of the original French. But the gain in clarity, with the little orchestra upstage, though very much visible behind the singers, was a notable compensation.Graham’s staging is efficient rather than stylish, costumed modishly in flat modern dress (designer April Dalton), where an element of – not necessarily medieval – strangeness might seem to be called for, and with gantries and ramps and canvas chairs in lieu of scenery. But it would be hard to imagine a more perfect musical performance, starting with the hyper-refined instrumental playing under James Southall, and with solo singing, including by chorus members (Rosie Hay, Howard Kirk, among several others), almost without blemish.Both the solo principals were previously unknown to me. The Australian mezzo Caitlin Hulcup (pictured right with Tom Randle), though unflatteringly wardrobed, sings the soprano role of Iseult so arrestingly and with such beauty of tone and expression that one simply lets the music blot out the visual image. The Tristan, Tom Randle, is marginally less immaculate, and a slightly apologetic actor in a role that needs some air of, albeit damaged, authority. All the same, this is a thoughtful and touching portrait musically, short on Wagnerian hysterics, long on reflective detail, especially in the big monologue where he discusses with himself the significance of King Mark’s failure to murder the two of them when he finds them asleep side by side in the forest.Should Le Vin herbé be repertory? Done, as here, in a single act without interval it makes for a fairly sombre evening, with many beauties of sound and incident but some lack of emotional variety. A lighter companion, in the manner of an after-piece, would help relieve the gloom, as would a more colourful, less ruthlessly functional staging. I’ve no quarrel with Le Vin herbé as theatre in itself. But it’s not for faint hearts.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/le-vin-herb%C3%A9-welsh-national-opera,4
144,"Kaufmann, Mattila, LSO, Pappano, Barbican",Kaufmann,Mattila,2017-02-09,Peter Quantrill,"Jonas Kaufmann’s legion of admirers could rest content. A well-received Lieder evening last week demonstrated that the world’s hottest tenor property had returned, both to London for a three-concert residency at the Barbican, and indeed to singing after burst blood vessels had forced several months of rest and cancelled concerts.A welcoming party duly cheered away before he had sung a note of the Wesendonck-Lieder. They had to wait until two lines of the fourth song before savouring the peculiar joys of Kaufmann’s voice at full throttle – appropriately enough, on the phrase ""Glory of the sombre world"". Otherwise caution was the watchword – unduly so, given how these songs have been owned in public consciousness by full-sail mezzos and helden-sopranos. Understandably so, however, given the demands of Siegmund which awaited in the second half.Continually hushed by Sir Antonio Pappano, the LSO accompanied with great discretion, allowing Kaufmann to use head voice without crooning. Even while husbanding resources, he brought a tight, reedy ardour to the first song. The two studies for Tristan were masterfully confided with a nervous ecstasy that supplanted the more reassuring tenor of his Decca recording made in the comfort of a Berlin studio.This Wagner evening had got off to a rocky start with the Prelude to Tristan und Isolde. Not quite together, not quite in tune, the opening lines vibrated with a suffocating intensity which left the climax with nowhere to go, before the composer’s spatchcocked concert ending hung around in a two-minute holding pattern.Act 1 of Die Walküre was done as a straight concert performance, relieved of the cut-price and pseudo-dramaturgical trappings of a “semi-staging”. The LSO launched into a metrical and warm-blooded account of the Prelude without the spasms of pain and fear which can wrack this music in a fully operatic context. With Karita Mattila’s entry as Sieglinde, however, came the chill of a house divided. She may have sung the part with fuller and more reliable tone earlier in her career, but her dramatic assumption was complete: mingled astonishment, bewilderment and a hint of recognition from the outset, yielding to sulky emollience in her dealings with Hunding (Eric Halvarson, magnificently brusque and contemptuous), and prompting an iron, baritonal outburst of lacerating self-pity from Kaufmann’s Siegmund.In its surges and heaves Pappano grasped the special, Boy’s Own character of this act, so distinct from the rest of the Ring as an apotheosis of Romanticism, which should feel too good to be true, because it is, as the rest of the cycle spells out. After some anxious minutes in which Kaufmann clutched his chest in the singer's reflex response to vocal frailty, his cries of ""Wälse"" were magnificently sustained, if without the exhilaration of sheer volume remembered from Wolfgang Schmidt, in this hall with this orchestra 20 years ago. But enough of impertinent comparisons with eye-popping thundersheets. Kaufmann actually sings lines in this music, which is a still-unusual, astonishing feat in itself.Apprehensive purchasers for his Strauss evening next Monday may be reassured. Don’t let the tickets out of your sight…@peterquantrill",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music-opera/kaufmann-mattila-lso-pappano-barbican,4
145,"Adriana Lecouvreur, Royal Opera",Adriana Lecouvreur,Royal Opera,2017-02-08,Gavin Dixon,"Adriana Lecouvreur deserves to be better known. The opera has a toe-hold in the repertoire, with occasional appearances, usually as a showcase for the soprano in the title role. Its composer, Francesco Cilea, is known for little else, but the opera demonstrates an impressive melodic gift, an ear for orchestral colour, and a rare ability to pace music in step with a complex and extended narrative.This production, directed by David McVicar and with sets by Charles Edwards, was first staged in 2010 and is returning to Covent Garden for a first revival. It is a spectacular affair, if uncontroversial in its period stylings, but the straightforward presentation only emphasises how the opera can stand on its own merits. And the cast assembled for the revival is superb, a mix of big stars and little-known names, but all perfectly matched to their roles.The story concerns an actress, Adriana (Angela Gheorghiu) in 18th century Paris, who is in love with Maurizio, Count of Saxony (Brian Jagde), but who has a rival in the Princess de Bouillon (Ksenia Dudnikova, pictured right). The other major characters are the theatre manager, Michonnet (Gerald Finley), who is also in love with Adriana, and the princess’s husband, the Prince de Bouillon (Bálint Szabó). Over the course of four substantial acts – it’s a long opera, but it flies – the love triangle plays out in a series of theatrical and aristocratic settings.In the first act, we are backstage at Adriana’s theatre. McVicar and Edwards present a full-sized wooden frame for a theatre stage as the backdrop, facing away from us, but rotated to different angles to furnish the various palaces and homes of the later acts, including a private theatre in the third, with the stage now facing the audience – this the setting for a ballet scene, brilliantly integrated into the narrative as a fracas in the onstage audience returns attention to the story, even as the dancers continue their act. It all ends tragically, of course, and while Adriana’s death scene, in the arms of her now reconciled lover, is protracted, Cilea is able to maintain the emotion, and the dramatic pretence, right up to the final bars.Just as in 2010, this revival is primarily a platform for Angela Gheorghiu. Half of the cast sheet is given over to a tribute to the star soprano, which tells us that she has now been performing at Covent Garden for 25 years and has given nearly 150 performances there. It is pleasing to report, then, that her voice is as agile as ever, perhaps lacking the tonal purity of earlier years, but still elegant and distinctive. Adriana Lecouvreur isn’t a particularly taxing role, technically, but it requires a broad range of tone and expression, all of which Gheorghiu delivers with ease. An innovative conceit of the opera is that, when Adriana performs her theatrical roles, her lines are spoken over music, and Gheorghiu has an impressive ability to exploit the dramatic potential. Very little of the role is particularly high or loud, but Gheorghiu is always able to command the ensemble, even at moderate dynamics.For the tenor role of Maurizio, the Royal Opera has made an impressive find with Brian Jagde. He has a voice of astonishing projection and power, and he is able to convey all the emotion that the role requires. He is sometimes a little lacking in finesse, swooping up to high notes or attacking fortissimo entries with unnecessary brutality, but the sheer dramatic impact of his singing makes him a huge asset here. Definitely a name to watch. Bálint Szabó is the main bass presence, as the jilted Prince de Bouillon, with a rich, even tone, satisfying and authoritative. Just a shame we heard so little of him.The Michonnet of Gerald Finley, by contrast, is an almost ubiquitous presence throughout the opera (pictured above), his role a kind of chaperone and confidente of the heroine. Finley was in excellent voice last night. If, like me, you are more used to hearing him in Wagner and German Lieder, you’ll be impressed by the fluency and elegance of his Italian – clearly a versatile performer. He has excellent diction too, and he can really act. Ksenia Dudnikova brings a deliciously sinister mezzo to the role of the love rival. Her tone is Slavic – edgy and occasionally caustic – but ideal for the role.Conductor Daniel Oren gives a proficient account of the score. He sometimes seemed to rush the singers, and some of the climaxes didn’t sparkle as they might, but the singing always held together, and the orchestra was on top form throughout. A great ensemble show then, with an impressive cast from top to bottom. It’s the ideal platform for Gheorghiu, but she is far from the only attraction here.@saquabote",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/adriana-lecouvreur-royal-opera-0,4
146,"Rigoletto, English National Opera",Rigoletto,English National Opera,2017-02-03,alexandra Coghlan,"This was supposed to be a triumphant return – one final encore for the production so good that audiences just couldn’t let it go. Instead, this 13th revival of Jonathan Miller’s Mafia Rigoletto seems like an apology. The designs are handsome as ever, the concept as neat, but the details of both direction and music are so scrappy and scattered that the show feels more like a basement clear-out than a loving restoration.  Raw, gritty brass launched the Prelude harshly on opening night, setting the tone for an evening where beauty was consistently the last, rather than then first, consideration. The score is delivered uncut, with no interpolated top notes permitted, as though conductor Richard Armstrong aimed to match the naturalism of the visuals with an equally unselfconscious, occasionally ugly, musical delivery. Perhaps if the production were better cast or sung that might work, but here it took away from the music without repaying anything in the drama.According to the programme, ENO staff director Elaine Tyler-Hall is responsible for this revival, but it’s hard to see much evidence of her work. The crowd scenes work well enough (though lack the collective menace they can so easily convey), but it’s the principals who really suffer, abandoned time and again in unlikely positions with nothing to do, desperately filling time with hand-wringing, head-shaking and all the other stock theatrical gestures of the unsupported actor. There’s no attention to musical detail either. Verdi’s score clearly tells us when the door to Sparafucile’s seedy bar swings open and the storm blows in, so why not time entries with it? Likewise, the gag with the jukebox in “La donne e mobile” would have been a lot funnier if the blow dealt to the machine by the Duke had been timed exactly to the restarting of the music.Musically things are little better. Armstrong directs a pedestrian performance, high on volume and low on senstivity, that only occasionally takes flight, generally when accompanying ravishing American soprano Sydney Mancasola (pictured below with Joshua Guerrero). Her Gilda spins cleanly and clearly, the unexpected colour of the bottom of her voice anchoring an easy, blooming upper register. Her musicality is hobbled however in ensembles by Nicholas Pallesen’s stentorian Rigoletto, who rushes and drags by turns, never really reaching an agreement with Armstrong and his tempi in this, his role debut.Joshua Guerrero’s Duke is adequate – sings nicely enough, if with rather gripped tone, acts nicely enough – but if you remember that this is a role recently taken at ENO by Barry Banks, and before that by the radiant Michael Fabiano, then it rather puts things in perspective. The supporting roles offer some consolation, from Nicholas Folwell’s glorious Monterone, dispatching his curse with ferocious conviction, to Madeleine Shaw’s thickly sensual Maddalena and Barnaby Rea’s Sparafucile – beautifully sung.Rosemary Vercoe and Patrick Robertson’s sets scrub up a treat; there’s nothing tired about Miller’s visuals, and the production could quite happily do another couple of decades if required. But it deserves much better than it gets here. If ENO is looking to box-office favourites like this Rigoletto to help balance the books then it is going to have invest in them – not money, but time and attention. It’s not enough just to dust off a hit and stick it back on stage. There’s nothing less forgivable than a second-rate production of a first-class show. Sort it out.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/rigoletto-english-national-opera-0,2
147,"The Snow Maiden, Opera North",The Snow Maiden,Opera North,2017-01-30,David Nice,"Late January, and the soul longs for winter's end. Which is why Rimsky-Korsakov's bittersweet fairy story about the fragile daughter of Spring and Frost whose heart will melt when she discovers true love, allowing the sun to bring back warmth to earth, is so apt. Unfortunately the time of year is also one for striking singers down, so we missed two of the principals on Saturday night. The good news: their covers were fine enough to carry the charm of director John Fulljames's mostly magical storytelling.It's not easy, given the plot's meanderings, even with major cuts that lop off some of Rimsy-Korsakov's best music. Two of the seven major characters don't turn up until some way into Scene Two, and a third not until Scene Three (daringly placed before the interval here in a long first half). And these are the ones who really ignite the drama, which extends a simple folk tale into a love-melee, complete with delicious musical heartache, in which A loves B who loves C who loves D.Elin Pritchard's archetypal blowsy Russian maiden-no-more Kupava is the stand-out, a bundle of squeals and foot-stamping whose acting almost conceals what a consummate soprano she is (the phrasing of her narrative before the ruler of the mythical kingdom, served by splendid breath control, is outstanding). I'll bet she was a terrific Musetta for Opera Holland Park. Philip Rhodes as the fickle object of her affections, Mizgir – whom we have charitably to assume is bewitched the moment he claps eyes on the supernatural Snow Maiden – has similar presence, a virile baritone who fills his boots to perfection. Ivan Sharpe, replacing senior tenor Bonaventura Bottone as the benevolent Tsar Berendey, enchants in the lovely aria with cello obbligato, one of at least half a dozen gems in this often inspired score.The magical set-up is achieved more by Giles Cadle's sets, Christina Cunningham's costumes and Will Duke's appropriately Russian-folk-fabric video projections than by the otherworldly creatures of the Prologue (scene with Yvonne Howard's Spring pictured above). Fulljames, in the best production of his I've seen, manages to have his cake and eat it, setting the whole thing in a garment factory – a Russian rural room which seems far from a sweatshop – and letting the charm take over when one of the girls daydreams her way into the role of Snow Maiden (Snegurochka, to give her her Russian name; ""Snow Princess"" is used in the text).Daisy Brown, taking over from Aoife Miskelly on Saturday night, was pretty as a picture, convincingly bewildered throughout, though with her voice-type one runs into the first of the problems with non-Russian casting: the role calls for a sweet, bright soprano, but one which develops forcefulness as the virginal nature-creature discovers her humanity. Brown was hard pushed to rise to the challenges of the last act especially, but how grateful we are to her that she made the show go on so well.More surprising, Yvonne Howard's Spring turned out – unlike the dependable bass James Cresswell as her old, cold lover – to be a little subdued. We've got too used, perhaps, to the type of fruity Russian mezzo with contralto undertones you hear in Irina Arkhipova, the peerless exponent of the role in the only good recording. Arkhipova also doubles the part of Lel, the randy shepherd boy. Timbre-wise, Heather Lowe is no match for Ekaterina Semenchuk in her chrysalis days, a superlative Lel for Gergiev in a Kirov concert performance at the Royal Opera. It's still a lovely, if soft-grained, sound, and Lowe pulls off the difficult feat of being utterly convincing as a handsome jack-the-lad (pictured below with Pritchard's Kupava). Inevitably Alasdair Middleton‘s ""new English version"", treading a fine line between folksy couplets and more than a smattering of contemporary colloquialisms, tends to make the faster patter sound like Gilbert and Sullivan (not necessarily a negative). Cameos from Joseph Shovelton, Claire Pascoe and Dean Robinson are executed with a light touch.This is a great opera for the chorus in its multiplicity of seasonal Russian folk numbers (ENO, please take note), and Opera North's crew eventually rise to the challenge, though they're a bit subdued in their first ritual. Blame that, perhaps, on Lucy Hind's rather faint choreography – admittedly she has no dancers to work with – and on Leo McFall's conducting. Spruce and mostly reliable, he shows little feeling for what should be the more expansive lyricism in the score, and not enough pre-Stravinskyan vitality (note how much the very end of The Firebird owes to the amazing final ensemble in 11/4 time).What a shame, too, to lose some of the quirkier music like the little oddity for Tsar Berendey's court, inspiration for Prokofiev's March in The Love for Three Oranges, and some of the later music where the Puck-like Wood Sprite leads Mizgir round and about. The final act survives more or less intact, which is just as well because it's one of the most consistently inspired in all Russian opera. Here you really do get the feeling that the company has honoured fragile Snegurochka and bigged up her reputation for other houses, with any luck, to adopt in seasons to come.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/snow-maiden-opera-north,3
148,"Les Enfants Terribles, Barbican",Les Enfants Terribles,Barbican,2017-01-28,Jenny Gilbert,"To judge from the hype in advance of this production, you’d think it must be a premiere. In fact Philip Glass’s dance-opera hybrid, written in 1996 and based on Jean Cocteau’s 1950 screenplay, received its first London performance at the Arcola Theatre six years ago. What’s new in this presentation, timed to straddle the Barbican’s “Glass at 80” birthday weekend, is that the work has now passed through yet another extraordinary imagination, that of the choreographer Javier de Frutos. Given his history as a provocateur on stage and off, he has been something of an enfant terrible himself.Yet perhaps this is the point at which that sobriquet will be put to bed. For while Cocteau’s story gives ample opportunity for outrageousness, de Frutos doesn’t take the bait, instead conveying obliquely the depth of the protagonists’ depravity. Fatherless and soon-to-be motherless siblings Paul and Lise are an odd, secretive pair who become more so after Paul is injured in a snowball fight at school, and brother and sister retreat to their bedroom full time, playing what they call The Game, a test of psychological one-upmanship. As they reach adulthood, The Game continues, but real life and loves encroach on their power over one another, and jealousy raises the stakes.The word “incest” doesn’t appear in the libretto, so the piece could be directed as a slow revelation. De Frutos makes the sibling incest plain from the start, which enables him to focus on how that impacts on others the pair draw into their sticky web: Gérard, an old schoolfriend, and Agathe, a young model Lise meets when she goes to work at a Paris fashion house. Glass’s score, for three pianos, seems morally indifferent. Its rippling broken chords, descending scales and endless trills – whether in urgent mode or ethereal – relentlessly motor the story to its terrible conclusion. Timothy Burke, conducting, keeps a firm grip on the fiendish pulse and tempo changes.The opera’s modus operandi, dictated by the composer, is complicated, despite there being only four characters in the story. The singers cast as Paul and Lise, giant of a baritone Gyula Nagy and soprano Jennifer Davis (both part of the Jette Parker apprentice scheme at the Royal Opera) are each shadowed by four dancers, expressing aspects of their actions and feelings. It makes for a curious community on stage, but no confusion. The singer cast as Agathe (Emily Edmonds) is allocated one dance shadow, and Gerard (Paul Curievici) none. He also has a speaking role as narrator, filling in crucial gaps.Thus the number of bodies on stage at any one time varies between two and 12, although there is only ever one person singing. For this is an opera made entirely of recitative: there are no choruses, no duets – this is as close to natural conversation as opera gets. What’s more, the singers’ excellent diction makes it possible for viewers with a modest grasp of French to follow the gist without constantly having to scan the top of the proscenium for the translation. It’s useful for the slang, though. There is something thrillingly transgressive about polished operatic voices calling each other “shitface”.Jean-Marc Puissant’s set design compounds these complications with multiple flights of steps, leading nowhere, and multiple revolves. In the course of many scene changes the sheer discipline evident in repositioning characters, props and staircases or clearing them all away in a trice is a spectacle in itself. Thirty minutes in on opening night there was a technical hitch and 10-minute delay. Thanks to the goodwill that the production had already generated, no one seemed to mind.Some of the narrative burden is taken by video (Tal Rosner), projected on screens that wrap around the back and sides of the stage. These supply captions (“The Game”), weather conditions (that snow scene), and a wall of unblinking eyes (memorable). The entire course of Lise’s courtship with the man she will marry is encapsulated in a video that shows their repeated greetings, progressing from formal to warm to amorous. It’s not only a moment of light relief, but a clever nod to Glass’s compositional process – that of modulated repetition.As for the dancers, it was a case of embarrassing riches to cast contemporary-dance stars such as Jonathan Goddard and Thomasin Gulgec as mere shadows. The key danced roles are taken by the Royal Ballet’s Edward Watson and Zenaida Yanowsky, both superb, and superbly nuanced. The choreographer doesn’t let five minutes go by before exploiting Watson’s astonishing half-past-six arabesque or Yanowsky’s sly chorus-girl leg flick. Gemma Nixon, as Lise No. 2, is terrific too, in a childish wrestling match with Watson that is anything but innocent.The highest level of artistry is evident throughout the production. The singers are also fine actors, Gyula Nagy’s Paul (pictured above) becoming progressively more revolting as he malingers in his pyjamas. Paul Curievici’s Gérard is culpably inert (he alone saw the incest and could have averted tragedy), but it’s Jennifer Davis as Lise who takes the evening’s laurels, for maintaining such a thrillingly sweet sound right through to the frantic dénouement.Any flaws in the show are the narrative flaws of Cocteau’s original novel: there are too many arbitrary swerves to make an arc. But why only three performances? The in-depth quality of casting may be a clue. It will be terrible indeed if this production doesn’t have a longer life.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/les-enfants-terribles-barbican,4
149,"Christine Rice, Julius Drake, Middle Temple Hall",Christine Rice,Julius Drake,2017-01-24,David Nice,"To catch the searing desolation of a lover scorned, you need to be the complete artist, with temperament and technique in perfect equilibrium. Mezzo Christine Rice has taken us from Berlioz's Marguerite and Mozart's Donna Elvira at English National Opera via Birtwistle's Ariadne to Haydn's, and - most taxing of all - the end of an affair by telephone in Poulenc's La Voix Humaine. The abandoned heroines of Haydn and Poulenc found themselves in the most exposed surroundings possible, the intimacy of a song recital in the giving acoustics of Middle Temple Hall, with only a superlative pianist, Julius Drake, as lethal accomplice.Of our three great British mezzos, Rice is poised somewhere between the refinement, sometimes verging on the chilly, of Sarah Connolly and the go-for-broke intensity of Alice Coote. This was a programme of supreme daring. The two monologues, in effect one-act operas, were separated by Ravel songs in five languages - Spanish, French, Italian, Yiddish and Hebrew - in what could have been an intermezzo but ended up in equal intensity: Rice's vivid characterisation of the dialogue between inquiring Jewish father and his piously rapturous son segued straight into what in effect became the boy's hymn of priase, a Kaddish of mesmerising power. The flashing power of Cancion española suggested that a whole evening of Falla, Obradors and Mompou from this chameleonic artist and her pianist would be utterly beguiling and idiomatic.At the heart of it all, the simple Chanson italienne crystallised the essence of the outer core (""I call my love, no one answers""). Haydn's Arianna a Naxos, for all Drake's supreme stylishness in the introduction (the pianist pictured right by Sim Canetty Clark), starts out as if it intends to proceed at the same anodyne level of too much in the composer's too many operas. But this, after all, is Ariadne with the breath of Theseus still fresh on her face (hand on cheek, self-caresses said it all in Rice's modulated and utterly convincing body language). Only in the second recitative is she allowed to explode with the grief of abandonment realised. Haydn's depiction of her legs giving way in the piano's modulations is truly remarkable, paving the way for the drive of the second aria.The move from luminous tenderness remembered to reverberating anguish unleashed lacerating music-drama underpinned by flawless technique and a voice seamless from bottom to top. How much more did a similar, more psychological journey impact in the much longer Poulenc/Cocteau monologue. You might at some points miss the lushness of the composer's sensuous, smoky orchestration, but the gain was in total rapport between pianist and singer, pauses and silences pregnant with anguish or expectation. It was wise of Temple Music's Song Series not to print a translation or to have supertitles; you needed to see every expression on the face of Rice's woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown, understand the impetus behind every word even if your French, like mine, was imperfect.Neither Drake nor Rice put a foot wrong as the constantly interrupted phone conversation with the lover who's ended the relationship shifts from putting on a brave face to a courageous cantilena of truthfulness, the seemingly endless depth and richness of the mezzo voice with its flawless upper register resonating around the hall. Never at any point was the sound forced other than to make a point of extreme desperation. The endgame was all the more devastating for the piano bringing into focus the final, funereal motif, seemingly an adaptation of a theme from one of Chopin's Etudes, and for the way Rice continued to ring the changes on the simple words ""je t'aime"". Absolutely remarkable, an out-of-body experience. Now I long to see and hear her in Britten's Phaedra, the other great mini-opera in all but name.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music-opera/christine-rice-julius-drake-middle-temple-hall,5
150,"Fidelio, LPO, Jurowski, RFH",Fidelio,LPO,2017-01-23,alexandra Coghlan,"Juxtaposition is a powerful thing. Just one day after Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the USA and mere hours after women across the world marched in unprecedented numbers to safeguard freedom and champion democracy, the Southbank Centre launched its year-long Belief and Beyond Belief festival with a performance of Fidelio – Beethoven’s blazing operatic hymn to freedom, hope and humanity. The score says it all, wrenches you each time with its dogged optimism in the face of despair and cruelty, its persistent faith. So why director Daniel Slater felt the need to gloss it with a series of gauche, quasi-philosophical dialogues is anyone’s guess.In a triumph of concept over content, Slater’s semi-staging opened with the orchestra in mufti, tea urns, props tables and costume racks strewn distractingly across the stage. We were witnessing a “rehearsal” of Fidelio, rather than Fidelio itself, complete with two actors (Helen Ryan and Simon Williams) who replaced the opera’s original dialogue with a series of meta-theatrical interventions, wandering through the action and delivering a commentary with aspirations of profundity (“Fear is passive; hope is active”, “Why do good people follow bad orders?”).Poorly rehearsed (cues were smudged, microphones problematic, lines forgotten) and poorly conceived (apparently Pizarro – another dictator in the mould of Napoleon, Stalin and Hussein – just wants to be loved after his unhappy childhood, poor lamb), this staging risked undermining everything that Vladimir Jurowski, the LPO and a fine cast were trying so hard to achieve. Thank goodness after the interval we were allowed to graduate to a “real performance”, and with everyone back in concert dress and extraneous clutter cleared away, things began to flow, propelled forwards by a ferociously brilliant, high-wire performance of Leonore No3 from the orchestra.Making the theatrical misfire all the more galling was the thrilling quality of much of the music-making. Anja Kampe’s Leonore (pictured above with Robert Dean Smith) pulsed with urgency and fervour, radiant through “O namenlose Freude”, though working audibly hard elsewhere at the top of her range. As Florestan, Robert Dean Smith matched her intensity, balancing raw power with some heart-stopping legato. Sofia Fomina’s Marzelline gilded each ensemble with her bright soprano, sweetly earnest in her dealings with “Fidelio”, and Kristinn Sigmundsson’s generous bass anchored everything as an unusually sympathetic Rocco.Though clearly under-rehearsed, the LPO gave a thrilling performance under Jurowski (pictured above), nine times out of 10 turning risk into reward. The woodwind playing in Act II was particularly lovely, the flute’s soft promise of hope singing sweetly out above the orchestral texture, and the collective energy of the Leonore overture made you long for a straight concert performance with nothing to distract from the music’s eloquence. London Voices made a superb chorus, bringing what should have been an unequivocal triumph of an evening to an ecstatic close.Truths are hard to come by these days, and we should nurture those we have. Silence the pseudish chatter of this production and you had Beethoven's powerful statement about hope and humankind. What a shame we could barely hear it over the dramatic din.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/fidelio-lpo-jurowski-rfh,3
151,"Summerfield, Jackson, Riches, Classical Opera, Page, Wigmore Hall",Summerfield,Jackson,2017-01-18,David Nice,"Young Amadeus is growing up in real time with MOZART 250, Classical Opera's ambitious 26-year project following its hero's creative life from childhood to the grave. 2015's start, marking two and a half centuries since the boy wonder's first visit to London, and its sequel had little to show of its main man, but plenty of other, senior composers flourishing in the same years. A full programme of 1767 told us a different story, with a surprise from the 11-year-old that was a kick in the teeth to those of us who thought Mozart was precocious and prodigious but showed no flashes of genius until his mid-teens.Grabmusik, which Classical Opera's Artistic Director Ian Page neatly proposed in his programme note as a Holy Week ""Cantata on Christ's Grave"", offers an impressive counter to Bach's compact narrative genius, some 40 or so years on from the heyday of Mozart's idol. The Soul rages; the Angel proposes a transfiguration into penitence and pain. Perhaps it was the sheer dedication and involvement of two among Page's ever-inspired selection of brilliant young singers, soprano Gemma Summerfield and bass-baritone Ashley Riches, which lent conviction to an assumed air of gravitas, but I like to think that the boy Mozart, living under the shadow of mortality (and nearly dying from smallpox later that year), really did find something deep within for the anger and the consolation. Riches caught every light in the titanic first aria; Summerfield used her unique combination of vibrancy and white-note soul-piercing to offer genuine balm.It wasn't so easy for Summerfield, destined as I've written before for highest distinction in Mozart's lyric-dramatic roles before hopefully hitting the Strauss heroines, and her equally distinguished tenor colleague Stuart Jackson (pictured right by Sebastian Wybrew) to come in cold on plangency in the concert's first half; both, I suspect, had found it more rewarding to develop characterisations by degrees in Classical Opera's superlative concert performance last year of Jommelli's Il Vologeso. The suffering of Gluck's Admeto for his Alceste was the one point in the first half that went deep; but for all Jackson's sympathetic nuances, this was only a reminder of how fine-tuned Gluck is, in his reformed attempts at pure music-drama, to the dramatic requirements of the moment, how difficult it is to take his expressiveness out of context.Certainly nothing around the Gluck aria, ""No, crudel, non posso"", before the interval suggested much individuality. Mozart's early Symphony in F (No. 6), was more remarkable for the chance it gave us – despite a few untidy upbeats – to hear the focused brilliance of Page's Classical Opera players, how the upper strings flamed against cellos and bass resonance in Wigmore acoustics – less kind on the voices at the front, which needed more air around them – and how stylishly harpsichordist Steven Devine could enrich the rest with his flourishes. The second violins' pizzicati in the Andante were especially arresting, more like guitar strumming – Sophie Barber looks like a born leader – and we'd hear them again at the end in the original Mozart adapted for his symphony, a duet from Apollo et Hyacinthus.Summerfield made lovely sounds in ""Frena le belle lagrime"" from Abel's Sifari, but this is generic stuff and it wasn't Emilia Benjamin's fault if her diligent work on the viola da gamba obbligato was too reminiscent of the double-bass labours of Giilbert and Sullivan's Lady Jane in Patience. But then there was the shock of the Grabmusik and pure mature genius in the tenor aria ""Vidit suum"" from Esterhazy-era Haydn's Stabat Mater. The two-part unisons as the Virgin sees her son ""dying, forsaken"" meshed perfectly with Jackson's most concentrated, intimate tones.Arne's First Symphony gave us a succinctness which could have been applied to the less individual Mozart symphony if there hadn't been an insistence on repeats not worth hearing, and C major-minor ambiguity after the pure Sturm und Drang C minor of the second Haydn number. That was further happy territory for Riches (pictured above by Debbie Scanlan), but he got his moment in the sun, or shade, with more individuality at the end. Page apologised that the encore wasn't from 1767, but Telemann died in that year, and his startling hybrid Orpheus offered another flash of genius as the supreme musician mourns for his Eurydice and violently casts his lyre aside. Typical generosity from Page and company; his programming always goes beyond the call of duty in bringing the obscure to light and offering – as in Grabmusik – true revelation.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music-opera/summerfield-jackson-riches-classical-opera-page-wigmore-hall,4
152,"La Traviata, Royal Opera",La Traviata,Royal Opera,2017-01-17,alexandra Coghlan,"It takes some pretty special casting to spice up Richard Eyre’s Royal Opera regular, currently returning for its 14th revival (with a 15th on the cards later this year). And that’s exactly what was on the bill here, with house debuts from both Joyce El-Khoury’s Violetta and Sergey Romanovsky’s Alfredo. If the result was at times uneven, it also had an energy, an uncertainty, that gave it a freshness lacking in more polished revivals.Lebanese-Canadian soprano Joyce El-Khoury arrived on the UK radar in 2012, singing Violetta for WNO, followed two years later by an outstanding Pauline in Donizetti’s rarity Les Martyrs for Opera Rara. It’s with international momentum building and a Glyndebourne debut scheduled for this summer that she arrives now at the Royal Opera.El-Khoury's is a voice worth waiting forHere is an Act I Violetta who’s every inch the mature, calculated seductress, who pauses to asks herself (quite reasonably) whether “…it would be a mistake” to fall in love, who displays herself as a naked ice-sculpture to a house full of guests. There’s none of the impetuous youthfulness we felt with Gimadieva this time last year, but there is a sense of repressed power, a dignity, that’s new. It’s a gambit that only heightens the impact of Act III, where El-Khoury’s self-dramatising heroine gives us a death scene of real desperation, a “Gran Dio!...morir si giovane” full of rage and pathos, using the full weight of her lyric soprano to thrust the dramatic horror of Verdi’s ending in front of its musical beauty.Vocally there’s still an unfinished quality to El-Khoury’s performance. Tone comes in and out of focus as this blowsy voice moves through the range, and it wasn’t until “Dite alla giovine” that she felt fully warmed up. Luckily it’s a sound worth waiting for, though I wonder how well it will suit the smaller space of Glyndebourne’s theatre this summer.But if El-Khoury (pictured above) was the big name going into this production, Sergey Romanovsky might just be the one to watch coming out of it. The young Russian tenor has a beautiful, baritonal colour to a voice that – though not huge – is all easy legatos and gloriously even tone. Add to that an unapologetic musicality, sensitive even in the heights of the brindisi, and you have something quite special. As yet there’s still quite a lot of tension at the top of the voice, and a physical stiffness that makes, inadvertently, for a rather touching hero.Artur Rucinski is a rather inscrutable Germont (pictured above, with El-Khoury), making up for his lack of dramatic arc in some wonderfully warm singing. There are fine supporting performances from David Shipley’s Grenvil and Yuriy Yurchuk’s Baron, and Jette Parker Young Artist Angela Simkin continues to impress as Flora.Daniele Rustioni’s swift tempi push the lovers cruelly through some of the Act I coloratura, and breeze through some tender moments, but generally work well for the ensemble scenes, giving this sedate production some much-needed pace. Bob Crowley’s stylized 19th-century designs look handsome as ever, and revival director Andrew Sinclair draws out some lovely new dramatic detail. This is a revival worth revisiting – a youthful and genuinely passionate account of Verdi’s classic score.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-traviata-royal-opera-1,4
153,"The Last Supper, BBCSSO, Brabbins, City Halls, Glasgow",The Last Supper,BBCSSO,2017-01-16,David Kettle,"You can tell it’s a big deal when even a handful of London critics abandon the capital for a Saturday evening in chilly Glasgow. And there were more besides in the capacity crowd for Birtwistle’s opera The Last Supper, given a semi-staged performance by the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra – seemingly anyone who’s anyone in Scottish music, from international composers to conductors and orchestra heads, and way beyond too. A big deal it most definitely was – and, miraculously, a free ticket too, since it was essentially a radio recording for a BBC Radio 3 broadcast (scheduled for 28 January) that ended up as one of the country’s hottest tickets in January.The Last Supper has rarely been performed since it was unveiled at the Berlin State Opera in 2000, followed by a Glyndebourne tour the same year. And there’s more than a whiff of millennial angst to its storyline, in which Jesus reunites his disciples to mull over whether Christianity has really helped the world in the last 2,000 years. If anything, though, what was already pertinent at its debut feels even more urgent in 2017 – the opera’s chilling list of atrocities committed in the name of religion can only be extended since its premiere.And as with much of Birtwistle’s output, on both the opera and concert hall stages, The Last Supper feels heavily immersed in ritual. That’s an aspect that Birtwistle himself questions in an illuminating interview put together for the BBCSSO web site, but it’s undeniably there in the opera’s strongly defined structure, which feels at times almost like a church service, and most of all in its strange, contemplative storyline.The Ghost, representing humankind, summons together the 12 disciplines, and ultimately Christ himself, for a re-run of the Last Supper, whose purpose, they work out, is to catch up on their achievements since they last met two millennia back, and more importantly to assess where Christianity has got us. Judas gets to justify his betrayal, and Christ halts proceedings for three mysterious visions – of the Crucifixion, the Stations of the Cross, and finally the betrayal itself, which seems about to repeat itself at the opera’s closing cock crow.Birtwistle’s music feels tremendously lyrical, even opulent 17 years after the opera’s premiere. It’s quite often blunt and uncompromising, but the Latin choral motets that accompany Christ’s three visions summon remarkable poise and focus in his choral writing, and his lengthy foot-washing scene, in which Christ humbles himself before each of his disciples in turn, has an astonishing sense of pathos even amid its wailing orchestration that’s only increased by its inexorable repetitions.Conductor Martyn Brabbins was the driving force behind the project, and he showed extraordinary insights into Birtwistle’s often thick scoring, never losing sight of its density and depth, but sculpting its layers with strong definition, and ensuring an involving dramatic flow alongside the opera’s more ritualistic unfolding. The violin-less orchestra was on remarkable, committed form, too, especially its often growling brass and intermittently shrieking woodwind, with James Crabb providing a distinctive twang on accordion in what’s traditionally the leader’s seat.Brabbins had an extremely fine cast for his account, too – and an oddly shaped one, with just one woman joining the 13 men singing the disciples and Messiah. Susan Bickley (pictured above) is a Birtwistle veteran, and she was superbly nuanced singing the Ghost, especially in her lengthy opening scene-setting aria. Roderick Williams was commanding as Christ, full of charisma yet controlled and restrained, his remarkable voice savouring every word of Robin Blaser’s libretto and delivering them with finely judged expression. With his widely vibrating voice and not always clear enunciation, tenor Daniel Norman (pictured below) seemed rather the odd one out as Judas, despite a deeply affecting performance – but Marcus Farnsworth as a concerned Philip and Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts as a petulant Thomas (still with his doubts 2000 years later) stood out among the disciples.And in many ways, director Victoria Newlyn’s minimalist staging gave the opera just the setting it needed. There was all the honest directness of a concert performance – with singers performing scores in hand, movement and gesture kept to a minimum – but she had the measure of Birtwistle’s big structures and his slowly unfolding repetitions. It would almost certainly have benefitted from supertitles to make Birtwistle’s word-setting ringingly clear, but there was almost a hypnotic quality to the production at times, and what felt like quite a moving sense of sincerity in making it very much a show for our own times. Yes, it was indeed a big deal, an ambitious project that showcased the skills and commitment of the BBCSSO – and judging by The Last Supper’s downright popularity with a Glasgow Saturday night crowd, one we should see more of in future seasons.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music-opera/last-supper-bbcsso-brabbins-city-halls-glasgow,5
154,"Le Grand Macabre, LSO, Rattle, Barbican",Le Grand Macabre,LSO,2017-01-15,David Nice,"The Big Mac – as in Ligeti's music-theatre fantasia on the possible death of Death – is here to stay. Back in 1990, three critics (I was one) were invited on to the BBC World Service to say which work from the previous decade we thought would survive. I opted for Le grand macabre, having seen its UK premiere at ENO in 1983; a certain distinguished arts administrator condescended to rejoinder that he thought ""even Ligeti has disowned that now"". Well, the last laugh goes to the composer, looking down from one of the fluffy white clouds he depicted so well in music. But he probably wouldn't have laughed much at Peter Sellars' fixed-idea semi-staging and Simon Rattle's vivid but heavy attack on the chameleonic score last night.Sellars (pictured below with Rattle at the final rehearsal) has been part of Le grand macabre's performing history. He presided over the 1997 Salzburg staging, for which Ligeti cut and reshaped the score to make it less talky and more sung-through; this version should have reached the Royal Opera, but the house's grand reopening couldn't cope with the production's mechanics so we didn't see it then. The Californian maverick writes beautifully in the programme about the work's ""hilarity and fun"" in its playful approach to the serious subject of Death arriving to sort out the decadent inhabitants of ""Brueghelland"" (the source is a 1934 play by the Belgian Michel de Ghelderode). But in his latest attempt to shoehorn the riotous ""flea market"", as Ligeti described it, into a rigid commentary on nuclear disaster, Sellars manages to sit on nearly all the ""hilarity and fun"".So while we puzzle out what's going on with the folk in white coats, starting out at a Nuclear Energy seminar and clearly, some of them, suffering from radiation, true meaning and gesture should be found in the London Symphony Orchestra under Rattle. They do indeed run the full gamut of Ligeti's sound cornucopia, from the familiar chord-clusters to the florid polyphonies (I've never noticed, for instance, the crowings of Rameau's hen – brilliantly taken by piccolo clarinettist Chi-Yu Mo – as strings revolve a Bourée perpetuelle to which Nekrotzar screws the jaded, sado-masochistic Astrologer's wife Mescalina to death (pictured below, Heidi Melton dragged along by Frode Olsen and Peter Hoare).This long second scene, though, needs the scherzoid touch Esa-Pekka Salonen brought to it in Salzburg – an excellent live recording exists, where the audience laughs a lot more than they did last night – if it is not to seem too diversionary for too long. Rattle was simply too heavy here, for all the loud brilliance of his players.Ideally the first and second acts should be run together if the spectators are not to come out in the interval wondering what it's all going to add up to. Both Ligeti and Rattle rise to the Great Day (or Midnight) of Destruction, director and conductor between them making full use of Barbican spaces for the big rattle-bag processional that unfolds against a ground-bass distortion of the pizzicato theme in Beethoven's Eroica finale. The apocalyptic trumpet fanfares are searingly brilliant, the LSO Chorus makes its mark as a revolting populace in the aisles of the stalls, and the final passacaglia – did everyone die or not? – tugs oddly at the heartstrings.The singing runs the gamut from good to terrific. Weak link, perhaps, is the Nekrotzar of Pavlo Hunka; he doesn't have the effortless authority of the Salzburg production's Willard White (who, when I interviewed him before the Royal Opera production that didn't happen, turned out not to have a clue about what was happening overall). But he rises to Death's attempt to wield his scythe and bring the world to an end – brought low himself by booze – with all his might. No qualms about Peter Hoare's clarion Piet the Pot, though this great singer-actor isn't allowed to be very funny, presented not as a devil-may-care toper but a conferencier on the verge of vomiting.Never, surely, have the androgynous lovers Amanda and Amando been more strikingly sung than they are here, Elizabeth Watts's restrained radiance matched by the contralto low notes of the stunning Ronnita Miller. Sellars has the rather good idea of running a film (by Nick Hillel) of flowers flaunting their stamens to be pollinated against their love ecstasies; nature, as initially represented by cows in a field beyond a nuclear plant, will triumph, though there's no suggestion of the libretto's lovers embracing in that fine and private place, a tomb. The savage sex play of henpecked Astradamors (Frode Olsen, who, like Hunka, could be more basso profundo-ish) and Mescalina loses its foul-mouthed edge when conducted, presumably, by Skype on laptops, but it's a luxury to have a dramatic soprano in a mezzo role. How deliciously low has the game Heidi Melton sunk from singing the virginal Elisabeth in Tannhäuser and the all-for-love Isolde.More defused still are the brutal games of the palace ministers and ineffectual Prince Go-Go in Act Two. Being originally stipulated as a petulant, fat child,Go-Go would most obviously be portrayed now as the all-too-likely soon-to-be American President. But countertenor Anthony Roth Costanzo (pictured above, right, with Joshua Bloom and Peter Tantsits) gives him luminous pathos; I was actually moved by his sad little ""hello""s as he emerges from the failed apocalypse, partly because it's one of the few places where Ligeti lets the score be simple – there's nothing but a double-bass line beneath the high voice. Sellars' one good substitution, albeit one that doesn't allow for Ligeti's surrealism, is to transform the exotic-bird Chief of Police into a dying radiation victim; the brilliant coloratura Audrey Luna (pictured below) goes to the edge with the horror.Throughout all this, though, Sellars' persistence in showing us the consequences of nuclear fall-out, not exactly synchronised on screen with the developing action, weakens the ever-blacker satire. At least that final ensemble, where sexual love seems to trump all, brings a searing pathos. Sellars has his cast collapse at the end; Ligeti suggests life goes on after all, and, as with most of his ignored stage directions, I prefer that. The best approach, surely, would be along the lines of Graham Vick's modern-life panorama in his unforgettable Birmingham Khovanskygate, but perhaps Sellars felt himself limited by the circumstances. Next time, it has to be all – preferably from Vick – or the kind of nothing that allows the audience free imaginative rein: in short, the kind of straight concert-hall line-up that worked so well for the Alice opera of Gerald Barry, Ligeti's true successor.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/le-grand-macabre-lso-rattle-barbican,3
155,"Written on Skin, Royal Opera",Written on Skin,Royal Opera,2017-01-14,alexandra Coghlan,"There’s a passage in Martin Crimp’s impeccable libretto for Written on Skin that describes a page of illuminated manuscript. The ink, he tells us, stays forever wet – alive with moist, fleshy, indecent human reality rather than dried into decorous fixity. As a metaphor for storytelling, it’s potent; as a description of George Benjamin’s score, it’s close to literal. Nearly five years after its Aix premiere, the music of Written on Skin still shifts and shudders with awkward emotional truths, buckling with characters who refuse to be pinned in place, hunching with musical tension that refuses to release. It’s a singular score, as well as a singularly beautiful one, and this latest revival only confirms its power.When last seen in London in a Barbican concert performance, Written on Skin was a fable about power, authority and the transgressive force of the erotic. Stripped of any staging the score spoke louder, and its astonishing play of musical light and shade (particularly shade) drew the ear into a series of sensual encounters – a bass viol, the glass harmonica, steel drums – that were each fresh and startling. Here, in Katie Mitchell’s vision, the opera becomes something quite different: a story about storytelling itself and its archaeology, about the ownership of history and narrative.Vicki Mortimer’s dolls house set looks handsome as ever in this first revival. Contemporary spaces jostle with a single medieval room in a design that dissolves membranes not only of time but of space, with a forest sprouting in its porous interiors. As Benjamin’s love-triangle between The Woman, The Protector and The Boy plays out in the period space, scientists labour diligently in their lab above – perhaps piecing together the very manuscript being written below – and occasionally stray downstairs to offer a prop, or clear a table.Jon Clark’s painterly lighting makes the space glow like a Dutch still-life, bringing depth and warmth to the earthy browns, pinks and creams, even as Benjamin’s score darkens its vision with violas and low brass. But, as Agnes insists, “Love is not a picture, love’s an act”, and this gorgeous frame does have to be filled with action. But that’s where the cracks in this production do begin to show. With so much movement going on in so many different spaces, there’s a risk that Benjamin’s instrumental interludes become reduced to incidental music to cover scene changes and domestic theatrical faff. In concert there was a far greater continuity, both of emotional action and tension, which heightened the tale’s claustrophobic simplicity and single-mindedness.But if the staging has its issues, there are none with the cast. Barbara Hannigan and Christopher Purves return from the original production as Agnes and her Protector husband, finding a tension at once sensual and horrifying in their relationship, while Iestyn Davies (pictured below with Hannigan) brings a new energy to The Boy – cooler, more ambiguous than predecessor Bejun Mehta, though stopping short of the frigid purity of Tim Mead’s Barbican performance. As a trio of voices they each share the ability to strip all colour from their sound, to disappear into the instrumental textures of Benjamin’s score (conducted here by the composer) at will. It’s a trick that plays with foreground and background textures, drawing yet more planes of depth in this skilful score. With Mark Padmore and Victoria Simmonds as the Angels – luxurious casting in supporting roles – this really is as good as it gets, vocally.So why all the empty seats? It’s a sight you almost never see at a Covent Garden opening night, and one that bodes ill for the house’s plans for a series of contemporary premieres on the main stage. This is a work that deserves a revival – demands it, even – but if it cannot succeed in wooing the contemporary theatre crowd who would queue greedily for Mitchell’s thoughtful production if it were served in any other London venue, then what hope is there for its successors? As an industry we’re so in thrall to the premiere, to the thrill of the new, that we seem to have forgotten the value and the pleasure of the second encounter and the third. Benjamin’s opera grows with each, and requires revisiting if its characters are to continue their quiet evolution.@AlexaCoghlan",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/written-skin-royal-opera-0,4
156,Best of 2016: Opera,Best of 2016: Opera,,2016-12-29,David Nice,"It was the best and worst of years for English National Opera. Best, because principals, chorus and orchestra seem united in acclaiming their Music Director of 14 months, Mark Wigglesworth, for his work at a level most had only dreamed of (“from the bottom up,” said a cellist, contrasting it with the top-down approach of predecessor Edward Gardner). Worst, because he stayed true to his principle of only working with a full-time company, and when the chorus unexpectedly accepted a nine-month contract, announced his departure.No-one wants a great company’s demise, but despite the announcement of Martyn Brabbins as a safe conducting pair of hands, and some good intentions, alongside the odd foot-in-mouth, from Artistic Director Daniel Kramer, it has to be downhill from now on. In the meantime, Wigglesworth never put a foot wrong in the six productions he conducted: from last year, Shostakovich’s Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk and Calixto Bieito’s more questionable Verdi Force of Destiny; from this, a revival of the Complicite Magic Flute which shone like the sun when the first showing had been ill met by moonlight, a searing Janáček Jenůfa (also a revival), Richard Jones’s Mozart Don Giovanni and William Kentridge’s Berg Lulu.Wigglesworth himself sees the greater achievement as the relatively long rehearsal period he spent with Jones on what might have been the start of a Mozart-Da Ponte trilogy, while Lulu was thrown up in an heroically short period of time. Nevertheless, while Don Giovanni (pictured below by Robert Workman, Christopher Purves as Giovanni with Christine Rice, a superlative Donna Elvira) is one of Helen Wallace’s choices, a rather too familiar view of Donna Anna’s supposed infatuation with her seducer undercut for me the genius of Jones’s vision for the change of identities in Act Two.Lulu was too rich both visually and musically to digest in a single sitting; I went three times, and saw more or different things on each visit. Kentridge’s artistic vision might seem overloaded, but all of it went to complementing the queasy spider-web of sound and even the sheer beauty of the Adagio representing the strange love between the protagonist and older Doctor Schön, stunning in each of Wigglesworth’s handlings of it. A superb cast was led, but not dominated, by Brenda Rae’s Lulu: if you can perform the role at the highest level, as she did, you set it alongside Brünnhilde or Isolde as a pinnacle of operatic achievement.Alexandra Coghlan shares this number one choice with me, and our runner-up is the same: Mozart’s Idomeneo at Garsington Opera. Here was exactly the kind of (nearly) all-British cast ENO should be nurturing but currently isn’t – we’ve had some fine American singers, but the company should be making more of home-grown talent like Elizabeth Llewellyn, Giselle Allen, Susan Bullock and Toby Spence, Garsington’s Idomeneo. (Pictured below by Clive Barda: Caitlin Hulcup as Idamante and Louise Alder as Ilia.)For the first time, Garsington’s new productions outshone Glyndebourne’s (though see below for an extra-seasonal Sussex spectacular). Alexandra also applauded Wexford Opera’s championship of Barber’s Vanessa, commenting of her choice that ""Barber’s unaccountably neglected score was treated with such care and understanding by conductor Timothy Myers and director Rodula Gaitanou, and yielded up its many secrets – both musical and emotional – in this deft and beautiful production"", though her Wexford review for theartsdesk was of another production.Richard Bratby hailed Longborough’s Jenůfa as ""practically a chamber piece in that small Cotswold theatre, and overwhelmingly raw and lacerating as a result"". We did well by Janáček in London, too: while the concert Jenůfa, unlike the ENO one, was a bit of a misalliance, Karita Mattila was 337-year-old, eternally youthful diva Emilia Marty in The Makropulos Case (or Affair, as they preferred to call it) at the Proms (Mattila pictured below by Chris Christodoulou), with Jiří Bělohlávek excelling even his own extraordinary standards conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Richard also loved the ""really life-affirming Mozart"" of Welsh National Opera’s Marriage of Figaro, while WNO regular Stephen Walsh warmed to the newcomer in the company’s Beaumarchais-based trilogy, Elena Langer's Figaro Gets a Divorce.Opera North came to London to tell us why its Wagner Ring, regardless of “concert staging”, is the best around, with superlative performances in each opera – from Wolfgang Ablinger-Sperrhacke as Loge in Das Rheingold, Robert Hayward hitting peak Wotan form in Die Walküre and Kelly Cae Hogan making a thrilling impact as a much-needed top Brünnhilde on the block developing from Valkyrie to woman in Siegfried and Götterdämmerung. The company’s Britten Billy Budd, so far limited to the North, also showed great ensemble work and casting from strength, the second of four operas this season working the chorus hard (as ENO’s plans so far have palpably not).Scotland-based David Kettle’s choice was another new opera shared between Scottish Opera and Music Theatre Wales that fortunately came to London and allows me to echo his accolade: Stuart MacRae's The Devil Inside, an engrossing thriller-narrative with resonances for today from Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Bottle Imp (pictured below by Bill Cooper: Ben McAteer and Nicholas Sharratt). Helen Wallace loved Barry’s high-velocity Alice’s Adventures Under Ground, and so did I, having found the revival of his The Importance of Being Earnest a case of a great ensemble getting a high-intensity second shot at a fiendish take on Wilde. How refreshing to have encountered so many fresh inspirations that stand every chance of lasting in the repertoire. We’re also lucky to be hearing the shock of the new in ancient rarities like Jommelli’s Il Vologeso. This may only have been a concert performance, but Classical Opera’s Ian Page has a fine instinct for casting distinctive voices and live-wire performers either fresh from college or still there: Gemma Summerfield, Rachel Kelly, Angela Simkin, Jennifer France and Stuart Jackson are all stars already. Jackson played the schoolboy who goes and sits in a tree deriding the valuelessness of human life in this year’s Glyndebourne Youth Opera, David Bruce's setting of Janne Teller’s terrifying but ultimately moral novella Nothing. No need to make any allowances for the schools chorus or the young in the orchestra; with Glyndebourne’s expert guidance, this was a show that worked at every level (pictured below by Robert Workman), begging a London airing (the opera premieres in Teller’s Denmark next year).Kasper Holten’s intelligent programming at the Royal Opera has also paid off, and not just in the portmanteau Earnest. Richard Jones had a good season – he needs to be there much more in the years to come if rumours over an end to his ENO association are true – with the revival of his gamut-running Puccini Trittico, Ermonela Jaho returning much enriched as a devastating Suor Angelica, and the mileage to be got out of a single line about a spinning top in a wonderful-to-watch Boris Godunov with a typically thoughtful central performance by Bryn Terfel (though it’s time everyone stopped favouring Musorgsky’s over-dry 1869 original version).Gavin Dixon welcomed Enescu’s stupendous Oedipe, and so did I, much moved by the redemptive last act, though I’m less sure that La Fura dels Baus’s colossal take always chimed with the composer’s vision. (But how's the image below, taken by Clive Barda, for the perfect picture on a plate? And it really was even more extraordinary to see live). Quibbles from some of us over Robert Carsen's second shot at Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier, a latecoming contender, have not prevented Peter Quantrill, who's seen both casts, from making it his top choice.Staying with the Royal Opera, it’s good to be able to end on a surefire prediction for a 2017 hit, since I count myself lucky to have seen the Salzburg premiere of Thomas Adès’s The Exterminating Angel – albeit hand-in-glove with turkey of the year, an outspokenly anti-Islam director’s mishandling of Strauss’s Die Liebe der Danae, which deseved better. Despite enduring issues with Adès's vocal writing, I can’t recommend the grip of the Buñuel-based subject or the teamwork of a superlative cast too highly. You’re in for a treat. My biggest wish, if not for next year then in good time? A Wigglesworth-conducted Wagner Ring directed by Richard Jones, who is hungry to have another shot at it.

157,"Der Rosenkavalier - Cast 2, Royal Opera",Der Rosenkavalier - Cast 2,Royal Opera,2016-12-23,David Nice,"Fiftysomething may well be the new 32, the age Strauss and Hofmannsthal made the central figure of the Marschallin in their ""comedy for music"" Der Rosenkavalier. Hearts and minds no doubt still move with Renée Fleming, senior doyenne of the role in Robert Carsen's Royal Opera production, but she is mirroring her character in bowing out gracefully to the next generation, and fellow American Rachel Willis-Sørensen is clearly the new Princess Werdenberg on the Viennese block. Even cast one's Octavian, the impassioned Alice Coote, is a known quantity to many of us, cast two's London-trained Anna Stéphany not so until now, at least in the UK.It’s odd not to find a single previous Strauss role mentioned in Willis-Sørensen’s programme biography, since it was her wilful Diemut in a Dresden semi-staged performance of his first romantic comedy, Feuersnot, which promised so well for her Marschallin. And here she is, a gracious and full-figured grande dame, making it clear why Antonio Pappano has chosen her to sing a killer role, Beethoven’s Leonora. If that suggests more weight in this Strauss than usual, it goes hand in glove with Andris Nelsons’ often very slow interpretation of the crucial monologues on the passing of time at the end of the first act. Already tailored for Fleming, perhaps, who I always thought made heavy weather of the older woman’s sense of transience, and this is decidedly a Marschallin inclining to the tragic side rather than the suggested “one eye wet, the other dry”.Yet Willis-Sørensen (pictured right in Act 3) certainly doesn’t milk it or strike any of Fleming’s more artificial notes, even if her golden middle range evokes a more powerful version of the Renée sound. The lower register is even richer and organically well connected to the rest, ample compensation for any lack of the conversational lightness at which Fleming excels. Willis-Sørensen gives full value to every note, not easy given Nelsons’ demands, and she’s exceptionally well matched to Stéphany’s equally vibrant Octavian.Convincingly boyish – choir-boyish, even, which makes the relationship between a teenage boy and a 32-year-old woman slightly queasier than usual – Stéphany peals out the impetuousness and can always be heard in the conflicts of Act Two. Perhaps she’s a little too solid in the Presentation of the Rose to suggest airborne magic, but Sophie Bevan compensates amply in a pitch-perfect performance as the love-object-at-first sight (I can’t agree with my colleague Alexandra Coghlan that there’s anything wanting here, even if – the opera’s ever-pertinent awareness of time’s passing becomes apt again – Bevan may be past the very first flush of youth at the top of the register). And Stéphany is the confused boy to the life in Act 3 (pictured below).That now makes – again, contradicting the original review – Matthew Rose the only less than fully vivid contender among the four principals, and not as yet anything near a match for the senior Rose-as-Ochs, Peter. It may be that his Baron needs to be a sober chauvinist pig in line with Robert Carsen’s sombre take on a world of male entitlement, and it’s good not to get the usual shtick, but there’s very little genuine comedy here.Unexpected humour does surface in the situations of Act Three, translated from the nominal setting of a seedy inn – Carsen throws out so much of Hofmannsthal’s original book, with mixed results – to a gaudy brothel, genius designer Paul Steinberg pointedly paralleling and parodying the Edwardian Hofburgesque red and gold of the Act One palace. Extravagant riches indeed, and maybe too much money was thrown at the production; where Carsen has commanded at least half a dozen pictures of dominant men in Act 1 and of fleshly ladies in Act 3, Richard Jones at Glyndebourne let Steinberg say it with one apiece. Alasdair Elliott’s drag madam – for which read plain “Innkeeper” in the original scenario – is one of the many delights here, and unlike so many of his predecessors at Covent Garden, hits the top B flat as he announces the unexpected arrival of the Marschallin spot-on (it's a good supporting cast for high notes – earlier, Miranda Keys' Duenna crowns the Act Two ensemble with a startling high C).From this point, with the long-delayed return of the key character, meaning and drama soar with the second cast, as they must. That’s partly due to Nelsons who, if he perversely avoids Strauss’s intended sense of pace at too many points – no Carlos Kleiber-style fizz here – always gets the right incandescence in the spider-web of sound, with stunning wind solos throughout. And yes, these three voices in the Trio are as rich and texturally aware as any you’re likely to hear. Which means this is a quality Rosenkavalier which looks like a million groschen and offers all the ideal sounds. How many more such Strauss evenings the Royal Opera can furnish in a world where financial constraints begin to bite I don’t know, but enjoy the lavishness on every level while you can.MORE RICHARD STRAUSS ON THEARTSDESKDer Rosenkavalier, Royal Opera (2009).

158,"Der Rosenkavalier, Royal Opera",Der Rosenkavalier,Royal Opera,2016-12-18,alexandra Coghlan,"Der Rosenkavalier is an opera of thresholds. Characters are caught between states – girlhood and marriage, lover and lover-no-more, woman and whatever lies beyond sexuality and desirability – while around them a city and a nation are also poised on the brink, blocking out the noisy winds of change with waltzes that swirl ever more urgently through parquet ballrooms and gilded staterooms. Doorways give way to doorways in Robert Carsen’s new production of the opera, drawing the eye endlessly forwards, though without ever revealing what really lies ahead.I say new production, but in many ways this Rosenkavalier is an elaboration of Carsen’s 2004 staging for Salzburg. Paul Steinberg’s sets make much more than a nod towards the originals by Peter Pabst, with Act II revealing the only substantial visual alteration. Carsen updates the action from the 1740s to 1911 – the opera’s year of composition. Where originally the narrative horizon concealed revolution and Enlightenment, now we can make out the silhouette of the First World War. The world of the Marschallin and her kind is about to give way to that of the arriviste Faninal – here an arms dealer, whose home is dominated by two giant guns.This is a man’s world, miles away from the fairytale abstraction of the Schlesinger production it replaces. The softness and intimacy of the opening scene between the Marschallin and Octavian is framed by the gaze of the generals and troops whose paintings fill the brocade covered walls of the bedroom, a stolen moment of female pleasure and power. Sophie’s Act II encounter with Ochs takes things further. Paintings of men become an entire cohort of living soldiers, encircling her, watching her humiliation. Only in Act III (no country inn for Carsen, but a gaudy brothel) do women dominate, but even here among the cross-dressing and the nudity such dominance is illusory.A co-production with the Metropolitan Opera, the show was devised as a farewell vehicle for Renée Fleming. The parallels here between a soprano gracefully stepping away from her art and a woman releasing her young lover are potent, and if it’s hard to separate the two narratives then it’s a legitimate, evocative confusion that makes for an emotive Act I, and an even more charged trio. Fleming’s voice is now so much smaller, its power husbanded so carefully, that there’s a very real fragility to it. Set against deliberately oversized, bombastic sets, its pathos is keen, sharpened by the delicate phrasing that is very much still within Fleming’s command, and supported by sensitive accompaniment from Andris Nelsons’s pit.But if Fleming is the singer the audience is there to see, Matthew Rose’s Ochs (pictured above with Alice Coote as Octavian) is the one they will remember hearing. It’s hard to imagine a more beautifully or fully sung Baron. There’s no buffo blustering here, just lovely long lines and full tone, whose patrician elegant cuts neatly against the vulgarity and violence of his behaviour. Carsen has no interest in caricature, and this villain is all the more unsettling for his plausibility. There are few out-loud laughs in the Mariandel scenes, but that’s exactly as the director wants it, transforming a farce into something real, something more threatening.Alice Coote’s Octavian (pictured below with Sophie Bevan as Sophie) is the other stand-out – boyish in tone as appearance, muscular and androgynous through her own music (some may find her tone too severe for Strauss), but softening into supporting warmth and sheen for the closing trio and final duet with Sophie. Her chemistry with Fleming is gentle, believable, but no match for the romping desire of her later encounters with Sophie. But Sophie Bevan’s heroine is less well cast. Though musical as ever, there’s no concealing that hers isn’t that naturally silvery, diaphanous soprano that does for the vocal textures what the rose theme does for the orchestral ones, tempering the string heat with that cool glimmer of flutes.Carsen’s resistance to caricature makes an interesting challenge of many of the supporting roles. Jochen Schmeckenbecher’s Faninal is decorous rather than spivvy, his ambition only evident in his collusion with the Baron’s Act II violence, and Miranda Keys manages to find some unusual ambiguities in her brief appearance as Sophie’s duenna Marianne (a character she also portrayed memorably in Richard Jones's Glyndebourne production). Helene Schneiderman’s Annina catches attention with her brightly matter-of-fact delivery, and some unexpected by-play with the Marschallin brings fresh interest to Scott Conner’s Police Commissioner.Handsome and functional, with just enough political bite to counteract decades of Schlesinger fantasy, this Rosenkavalier promises to serve the company well. It’s certainly a good foil for Nelsons, whose account of the score, from a hurtling, surging Prelude onwards, tempers indulgence with driving energy and urgency. Despite the Marschallin’s best attempts to stop the clocks, time paces forwards. It’s a tread whose impact we feel strongly here in Carsen’s updated setting, whose contemporary parallels speak so much louder now than they did in 2004. The time for fairytales is past; even a silver rose has its thorns. MORE RICHARD STRAUSS ON THEARTSDESKDer Rosenkavalier, Royal Opera (2009).

159,"El Niño, LSO, Adams, Barbican",El Niño,LSO,2016-12-05,David Nice,"Second and third times lucky: after the migraine-inducing multimedia overload of Peter Sellars's premiere production of El Niño, first seen in London in 2003 and subsequently excoriated in eloquent prose by the composer himself, John Adams's layered masterpiece has had two further performances here proving that the drama is all in the music. Vladimir Jurowski's 2013 Festival Hall interpretation literally had the edge, in its razor-sharp focus, on last night. But it's always good to see the composer as conductor make light of his rhythmic complexity as he nears his 70th birthday, and we also got to hear three stunning soloists fresh to the work.As the title implies, there is the natural violence embodied in the storms of an unpredictable phenomenon as well as the ambiguous birth, to pain and to glory, of a special child (""niño"" in Spanish). In one of the carefully selected Gospel texts, Joseph asks Mary why she weeps one moment and laughs the next. She tells him: ""it is because I see two peoples with my eyes, the one weeping and mourning, the other rejoicing and glad"". That duality makes this an apt nativity story to embrace at the end of 2016 (in one of the little spoken prefaces at which he's become so good, Adams imagined Herod today tweeting at 3am his loaded wish to be led to the infant Jesus).The most vivid bearer of the two sides, apart from the orchestra, is the soprano soloist. The music was written to showcase Dawn Upshaw's girl-next-door radiance as Mary up to the birth and her new-found (in 2000) ability to twist the expressive knife in the most shattering and musically complex number of Part Two, the climactic setting of poet Rosario Castellanos's bitterly ironic ""Memorial de Tlatelolco"", Adams's ""slaughter of the innocents"" enshrined in the hushed-up 1968 massacre of Mexican students. If Joélle Harvey (pictured above by Arielle Doneson) couldn't quite emulate Upshaw's cutting edge here, her devotion and emotion were total, and her youthful luminescence always shone (though I'm not quite sure why the three soloists needed the same amplification as the countertenor trio; except in big ensembles, Adams always keeps the orchestra down for them).Castellanos is to El Niño what Wilfred Owen is to Britten's War Requiem, giving, along with fellow Mexican Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, the Chilean Gabriela Mistral and Hildegard of Bingen, a much-needed feminine perspective to the wonder and terror of childbirth. She's a poet I'm immensely grateful to Adams and Sellars, his anthologist, for letting me discover. Mezzo Jennifer Johnson Cano couldn't quite banish memories of the late Lorraine Hunt Lieberson's superior sinuousness in the wonderful setting of ""La Anunciación"", Castellanos's vital female take on the mystery of conception and pregnancy, but later brought tears to the eyes with her part in the duet ""Se habla de Gabriel"" (""Speaking of Gabriel""). Hers is a magnificent instrument, as is the revelatory bass-baritone of Davóne Tines (pictured below): memorable in Joseph's anguished reproach ""Mary, why did you do this?"", shatteringly good in the high-lying ululations of ""Shake the heavens"", and deeply moving as Joseph sees everything in mankind and nature still at the moment of birth.Adams has a dependable group in countertenors Daniel Bubeck, Brian Cummings and Nathan Medley – memorable contributors to El Niño's even more complex if not quite as symmetrically perfect sequel The Gospel According to the Other Mary. At the one point where they step out as soloist Kings, Medley was quietly remarkable in the easeful switch between natural and falsetto registers. Adams's careful selection of instrumental colours to match brought forward amazingly expressive work from the LSO wind, while the brass helped to underline the mounting tension of Part Two and the violent snaps when the storm breaks. A professional choir might have given us more focus in quieter passages, but the London Symphony Chorus offered block shock in the apocalyptic moments. Who can ever forget, once heard, massed voices and snapping orchestra in the downward bending of ""For with God no thing shall be impossible"" from its D major brilliance?And the London Youth Choir (all girls, from what I could see) played its part in the final miracle with real finesse. All that's been lacking from the richly shifting canvas have been the multiple voices of children. At the point in the numinous setting of the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, where the infant Jesus commands a palm tree to bend down its fruit for the refreshment of the refugee family and fountains pour out from the roots – eerie ascents to match the downward cascades from heaven of Part One – the young intone Castellanos's most simple and beautiful poem, ""Una Palmera"", ending with the simple word – voices in thirds, finally accompanied by one guitar only – ""poesía"" (""poetry""). It's the benediction we all need towards the end of a terrible year.Next page: watch Davóne Tines sing 'Ol' Man River'",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music-opera/el-ni%C3%B1o-lso-adams-barbican,4
160,"Das Rheingold, Hallé, Elder, Bridgewater Hall, Manchester",Das Rheingold,Hallé,2016-12-01,Robert Beale,"With two of the biggest parts of the tetralogy already behind them, it might have seemed that Sir Mark Elder and the Hallé would aim simply at as near a perfect recording-cum-concert of Das Rheingold as possible, to get one more in the can and head for the final straight in a year or so’s time. But this Bridgewater Hall performance was more than that: a magisterial account of the score – done in one continuous take of two-and-three-quarter hours – and the recording based on it and its rehearsals, when it appears, will no doubt be a notable and probably great one.It was also an entertaining and highly dramatic account of Wagner’s ""Preliminary Evening"" of the Ring, with some beautifully characterised accounts of individual roles. The semi-staged production (director Ian Rutherford was credited in the programme booklet this time) brought a sense of occasion along with a few minor bumps and thumps, and the audience reaction may well enliven the final recorded result. We had, among other straightforward props such as a couple of thrones, a visible cloth of Rhinegold, which could be shared by the Rhinemaidens, bundled away by Alberich, wrapped all around Freia as her ransom was paid, and finally become a giant-size garotte with which Fafner murdered Fasolt. The Hallé were taking a few leaves from Opera North’s recent book in this approach, and in some ways doing the job (though without live film projection) even better.Sir Mark was doubtless aiming for opulent orchestral sound, which became apparent, with double basses divided four to each side of the stage, as the great opening crescendo was built. It had an enviable combination of smoothness and precision, as the string figurations rippled and eddied (with the lightness of articulation the Hallé strings, led by Lyn Fletcher, have perfected now in the Bridgewater Hall). In the first mountain height scene, the brass revealed their full resplendence, the Wagner tubas beautifully blended.Our Rhinemaidens (Sarah Tynan, Madeleine Shaw and Leah Marian-Jones), moving barefoot on the stage, were a delightful trio, but Samuel Youn’s acting and singing as Alberich stole the opening scene – there was life and imagination, as well as a magnificent voice. He gave us a wonderful off-stage cackle as he stole the gold, and later a superbly sung and, with Elder's help, solemnly enacted curse.So up to the heights, where Iain Paterson (pictured above) as Wotan appeared in tuxedo and loosened neck-tie (a common uniform for the gentlemen gods) and relaxed demeanour – he is supposed to be half-asleep to begin with – thence gaining gradual strength and authority. This was not a mighty tyrant of a Wotan, more one who knew his own insecurities, but by the end of the opera he attained a kind of grandeur. Susan Bickley’s Fricka (pictured below) displayed a regal breadth of tone and commanding edge to her voice in singing that lent distinction to the final scenes.Emma Bell as Freia injected the emotional charge of a maiden in distress, and the giants – in boiler suits – were nicely complemented, as Reinhard Hagen emerged as an appealingly naïve Fasolt and Clive Bayley his meaner, nastier brother. The former brought one of the most accomplished characterisations of the evening, with enough tenderness in his feelings for Freia (underlined by principal oboe Stephane Rancourt) to make one feel almost sorry for the poor guy. David Stout as Donner and David Butt Philip as Froh made their contributions with the fire of younger voices, and the latter had fine moments in the final scene of the opera.Will Hartmann was an intriguing Loge – his is a noble, at times lyrical tone quality, no wheeler-dealer caricature but a serious power-broker and fixer (very different from Opera North’s Wolfgang Ablinger-Sperrhacke), but constantly alive and always alert to comedic by-ways. His interaction with Alberich in Nibelheim was theatrical and engaging, and the scene with the Tarnhelm allowed Youn to use his varied voice colours effectively. Nicky Spence was a grovelling and grasping Mime, but with a very fine voice colour to show off, and Susanne Resmark almost other-worldly in the richness and fullness of her role as Erda. It exemplified the director’s use of the entire performance space, as she materialised from on high in the side-circle seating area, while the finale’s cries from the Rhinemaidens were from higher still in the auditorium, just off-stage with their accompanying harp (and piloted by Hallé assistant conductor Jonathon Heyward).The orchestral transition to the final scene, and its climactic tuttis and crescendos, were thrilling: we got a virtuoso display of coloured lights and stage smoke (a good job the sprinklers didn’t come on) – but in truth the splendour of the sound was quite enough.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/das-rheingold-hall%C3%A9-elder-bridgewater-hall-manchester,5
161,"Alice's Adventures Under Ground, Barbican",Alice's Adventures Under Ground,Barbican,2016-11-29,David Nice,"Having musicalised the madness in the method of Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, what would that wackiest of composers Gerald Barry turn to next? Why, dear child, what else but the method in madness of Lewis Carroll's Alice books. Except that method is mostly discarded in the shards of nonsense extracted from Carroll, and to be found only in the musical art of compression.Usually you look sceptically at a cast which includes both the Mad Hatter and Humpty Dumpty as portent of a watered-down Alice compendium. But this savage parade, given its European premiere in last night's Barbican concert performance, whizzes us through both Alice's Adventures in Wonderland - Carroll's first manuscript, adopted by Barry as his title, doesn't contain two of the famous sequences used here - and Through the Looking Glass both sequentially and in less than half an hour apiece.Alice (Barbara Hannigan, high-wire Barry favourite) squeaks out scales and arpeggios in competition with an orchestra which, as in Earnest, favours brass and wind as she plunges down and down; the ever-virtuosic and clarion Allan Clayton switches in a second from White Rabbit to join the three other male voices as Bottles - ""Drink!"" - and Cakes - ""Eat!"" (pictured below: Clayton, Peter Tantsits, Mark Stone and Joshua Bloom).Then we're at the Duchess's door, behind which plates are smashed - not literally, Earnest-wise, as Barry doesn't repeat obvious tricks - and the male quartet play extended baby-chorus to ""Speak roughly to your little boy"". It's on to a Mad Tea Party and the Queen's Croquet Ground, where a game without rules is played out to piano exercises in Barry's only major departure from Carroll's text, before a demented (and text-inaudible) rendition of ""Jabberwocky"" in Russian - later we also get ""Jaseroque"" en français and ""Jammerrock"" auf Deutsch - hurls us through the looking-glass and into the garden of live flowers. What follows is an even more thorough selection from the second book featuring passages that can't have been set to music before.The filleting favours the ensemble - virtually the Earnest set-up - though the hard-working singers, constantly having to swig from their ""drink me"" bottles of water for refreshment as well as transformation, do get some wonderful solos and duets. Hilary Summers' inimitable contralto pairs off with a single double-bass for the dormouse reverie, while in the looking-glass world fragments of Humpty Dumpty's and the White Knight's songs get very different treatments. Joshua Bloom exercises egghead restraint to the tune of Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"" setting - pay-back time after Earnest, where only Schiller's words were declaimed at rapid speed in German - and Mark Stone successfully stays on his horse during yet another of the score's regular buckings. As for duets, the wistful Mock-Turtle double act of Summers and Allison Cook for the Lobster Quadrille is rudely mirrored in the second-half dissonances of Tweedledum and Tweedledee's ""The Walrus and the Carpenter"" (or some of it).Lurid sounds from the Britten Sinfonia under no less than Barry's good friend Thomas Adès (pictured above with the composer on the left and the cast at the ""curtain call""), are frequently capped by Bruce Nockles' virtuoso trumpet; they play music of blatant speed for flights, runs and train journeys, and pastiches of sundry dances and processionals (the King and Queen of Hearts' cortege number is a corker). Respite usually only comes in the speech-song with its rigorously notated silences, though there is, finally, an equivalent to Earnest's melancholy, post-coital Act Three Prelude: the slow motion Valse triste to which the Red and White Knights thrash it out, counter-intuitively as usual with Barry.The odd singer out, in an unexpected way, is Hannigan: attired more like Duchess or White Queen than little Alice, inclined to mug a bit in a way that her mostly deadpan companions don't (full marks to Clayton especially and Allison Cook's lower-key displays). The protagonist is rarely at the centre of things in the way she is in the books, but Hannigan proves determined to wrestle back attention from time to time. Even with miking her text, and the communal songs, can't always be made out. There is, typically, no comfy Oxford context for this Alice; they're all mad in Barry's world, and we wouldn't have it any other way. Staging next? I wonder: only video work or a cartoon would get the stage directions up and running to match the score's furious velocity. But, like Earnest, this score is here to stay. ALICE'S ADVENTURES ON STAGE AND SCREENAlice, Scottish Ballet.

162,"Large, Hudson Shad, BBCSO, Gaffigan, Barbican",Large,Hudson Shad,2016-11-24,David Nice,"Has there ever been a more pertinent time to revive the poetic mythologies of Brecht and Weill? The writer said that the good-life-for-dollars city of Mahagonny was not exclusively an American state of mind and should be set in any country where it's performed. But the inverted morality tale of The Seven Deadly Sins explicitly references seven American cities. And with lines like (in the Auden/Kallman translation) ""If you show your offence at injustice, Mr Big will show he's offended"", it's very much of the moment. Add a performer of colossal magnetism like Storm Large, the slickest Weillian barber-shop quartet in the business and a searing BBC Symphony Orchestra under James Gaffigan, and there were more than a few shivers and goosebumps last night.Unfortunately the way to this skewed American road journey was, for the first half of the concert, strewn with lumps. If there's a 20th century symphony less worthy of resuscitation than émigré Korngold's baggy monster in F sharp, I can't think of it. The first idea, actually sketched in Vienna in 1919 rather than Hollywood in the late 1940s, like the rest of the symphony, suggests this might be Vaughan Williams' Sixth-and-a-half Symphony. But it's not even half as purposeful as anything by that composer.The first movement gets held up by a tune which starts like ""When I fall in love, it will be forever"" – a hit in 1952, the year of the symphony's completion – and never recovers its sense of direction. The scherzo slow-wittedly insists on its basic rhythmic pattern before breaking out into a proto-Dallas theme on the horns and grinding to a halt in a sludgy trio, after which we have to hear the whole long first section again. At the halfway mark of the slow movement, depressing but not in a good way, I just wanted to leave the hall. The only light at the end of the tunnel after an interminable cyclical parade of subfusc ideas was the yellow right-hand page at the end of the players' scores. I can imagine a lighter touch than that of Gaffigan (pictured below by Daniela Kienzler), but the excellent orchestra was saddled with a dinosaur.It might have been overkill, but Weill's Second Symphony – close in idiom and time to The Seven Deadly Sins – would have made a much livelier first-half candidate. No complaints about the a cappella intermezzo, a parade of music by Germans (Weill and Walter Jurmann) and a Ukrainian (Dimitri Tiomkin) straddling America and pre-World War Two Germany. The male quartet representing Hudson Shad seemed at first deceptively ramshackle, an amiable bunch of rum-looking coves, but once the pitch settled, you realised how consummate they were (and besides, I could listen to the narrative drawl of bass Wilbur Pauley for ever). Ingenious arrangements took us from the off-kilter wackiness of young Weill's Klopslied (Meatball Song) to Tiomkin's 'Do not forsake me, o my darlin'"" and a delicious first encore, the theme song for Rawhide.Storm Large was more than just the icing on a bittersweet cake as the tall, sinuous Anna of The Seven Deadly Sins who leads her more pliant sister – a dancer in the somewhat confusing scenario of the ""ballet chanté"", largely ignored here – on a soul-destroying journey from Louisiana to the big cities and back. Much pussy-grabbing is involved, we infer, to convert physical assets into cash. Svelte and dangerous, Large’s Anna I controlled their progress with natural ice and fire, every word keenly inflected without a hint of overkill and the voice – like the men’s – perfectly miked. Her concession to the steady breakdown within as the sisters subdue their natural instincts – the “sins” of the “petit bourgeoisie” – for hard cash was to hit the bottleMaybe supertitles for the action might have made clearer what sin happens in which city, but the only weakness of the original libretto is its outline for the mime/dance sequences, which we didn't need and didn't get, and by discarding her coat to get low down and dirty for nightclub and the movies, Large suggested everything. The ghastly family back home projected the solos as well as the close harmony – hard to pitch in the mostly unaccompanied “Gluttony”, but they did it – with deadly focus very different from their ambling amiability in the previous sequence. And from the first scything pair of clarinets as Anna sets off, hard edges won over romantic yearning, tight rhythms appropriately balletic for “Pride”, “Anger” and “Avarice”. Large’s final litany of what a girl needs to suppress to make money before Anna returns, broken, to the folk back home was spine-tingingly climactic; no wonder a small but appreciative audience roared its approval. A perfect masterpiece, perfectly done.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music-opera/large-hudson-shad-bbcso-gaffigan-barbican,4
163,"DiDonato, Il Pomo d'Oro, Emelyanchev, Barbican",DiDonato,Il Pomo d'Oro,2016-11-23,alexandra Coghlan,"Most singers give recitals, and very nice they are too. But there are some – Bartoli, Florez, Netrebko, Terfel – who really put on a show. Mezzo Joyce DiDonato might just be the queen of this select band, and between the projections, smoke, sound effects, costume changes, lighting design and a solo dancer, her latest project throws down the gauntlet to any singer who thinks it’s enough just to learn the music and turn up in a clean frock.In War and Peace is a classical concept-album. Faced with a world of ever-escalating conflict and chaos, DiDonato turns to music, both to explain man’s darkest and most violent urges and to offer them consolation and resolution. Can music create peace? That’s the question asked here in a programme of two contrasting halves.The answer remains uncertain, but if anyone can make it so by sheer force of will it would be DiDonato. You can’t fault her for effort. This is a singer who has crafted every aspect of this performance, from repertoire (largely Handel and Purcell, but also featuring rarities by Leo and Jommelli as well as a wonderfully anachronistic bit of Arvo Pärt) to the choreography and visual narrative of the performance. It’s a lot; you don’t come to a DiDonato recital for understatement, and at times the many elements competing for attention become overwhelming. But at best it’s an entirely new way of thinking about the concert format – a classical concert for the stadium generation.If DiDonato were a lesser performer none of this would work, but even among so much distraction it’s the mezzo who holds our attention. “Scenes of horror, scenes of woe” from Jephtha makes an arresting opening, scuttling strings matched by the nervy progress of the voice, lurching between extremes of range and texture. It’s music made for a singing-actress like DiDonato (pictured below), and she revels in it, drawing baroque ensemble Il Pomo d’Oro and conductor Maxim Emelyanychev with her into this gorgeous, grotesque sound-world.The coloratura numbers – Leo’s “Prendi quel ferro, o barbaro!”, Jommelli’s “Par che di giubilo”, Handel’s “Da tempeste” – surge and foam with minutely controlled passion. This isn’t spontaneous singing, but there’s a delight in hearing such careful vocal choreography, such meticulous shading and pacing. Just occasionally the voice betrays its master, blurting with too-vigorous vibrato or wavering when reduced to whitest purity – the product of too much crafting, too much control where others might release?But it’s the slower arias that offer the greatest challenge here. The stillnesses, the absences in both Dido’s Lament and Handel’s “Lascia ch’io pianga” are far more demanding than any amount of semiquaver runs, and DiDonato’s solution is bold. She keeps ornamentation to an absolute minimum and lets the music do the talking, allowing her voice to be a vessel rather than the focal point. With sensitive collaborators like Il Pomo d’Oro, virtuosi in their own right, it works brilliantly, and offers the necessary counterbalance to so much extrovert showmanship and excess.This is a curious concert, a concept not everyone could pull off. Oddities, like string arrangements of Gesualdo’s “Tristis est anima mea” and Pärt’s “Da pacem, Domine” work surprisingly well, creating a flow of musical narrative that’s miles away from stand-and-deliver recitals with their regular punctuating applause. DiDonato forces her audience to swap musical bonbons for something emotionally and musically meatier – arcs of musical storytelling that draw these works together into something larger. Is it enough to change the world? Very probably not. But if it changes how we think about concert programming, then that’s no small achievement either.@AlexaCoghlan",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/didonato-il-pomo-doro-emelyanchev-barbican,4
164,"Manon Lescaut, Royal Opera",Manon Lescaut,Royal Opera,2016-11-23,Gavin Dixon,"Jonathan Kent’s Manon Lescaut is back for a first revival at Covent Garden. It’s a gaudy affair, and seems calculated to provoke. But there are some interesting ideas here, and the musical standards remain high, even from the lesser-known names of this second-run cast.Kent has taken on the laudable task of updating the opera, moving the action away from its 18th century setting to find contemporary resonances. But there are big problems: no one sends their daughters to convents any more, and all the elopements and sexual proclivities, while they might raise eyebrows today, wouldn’t shock in the way the story requires. Kent’s solution is to add a helping of voyeurism into the mix. In the second act, Manon makes a porno, watched by an audience of dirty old men, and the third act plays out as a reality TV show. The idea, it seems, is to turn everything round to the audience, to ask viewers what’s in it for them. It’s a neat trick, but there is little subtlety here, and the concept becomes a distraction – especially since Puccini trains the narrative squarely on the two lovers at its centre. Moving the attention away loses the focus, and with it the emotional engagement.When this production was first staged, in 2014, the lead roles were taken by Kristīne Opolais, Jonas Kaufmann and Christopher Maltman. Those are tough acts to follow, but the revival cast (here directed by Paul Higgins) is a good one, working well as an ensemble, and with all the main singers up to the vocal challenges. The best performance, both musically and dramatically, is from Levente Molnár as Lescaut (pictured above with Eric Halfvarson as Geronte). His is a smooth, broad baritone, perfectly Italianate (though he’s Hungarian), easy on the ear but with plenty of emotion. And dramatically, there is a sense of realism about his expressions and reactions that often saves the moment as the visuals descend into absurdity. The second act has the most garish of Paul Brown’s sets, with Manon’s boudoir a full-sized Rococo room – mouldings, door fittings and all – but in transparent Perspex and positioned high above the stage. Not a promising start, but the early arrival of the Molnár as Lescaut brings instant engagement, and an essential, if slender, thread of credibility.Sondra Radvanovsky is a real find for Manon (pictured right), with impressive vocal projection and tonal support. Dramatically, she is up against the production itself in the second and third acts, but in the fourth, which takes place on a crumbling road flyover, the director has little choice but to hand the reins over to her. It’s a long and painful death scene, but Radvanovsky makes it compelling. Her Des Grieux, Aleksandrs Antonenko, gives her all the support she needs here, though he’s not an ideal romantic lead. His voice is big, but husky and angular. And, again, he is not really helped by the production – the opera needs him as the focus of attention in the opening scenes, but instead we are distracted by the garishly-clad chorus and Manon and Geronte’s incongruous entrance in a (Renault, I think) people carrier. Antonenko is proficient, but he can’t compete, though he holds the stage better when the distractions recede. Eric Halfvarson is well cast as Geronte, all the more sinister for his diminutive stature, and old enough to be credible. An excellent voice too, although slightly strained by the second-act finale.Antonio Pappano is in his element, and inspires the orchestra to some very fine playing, especially in the vibrant overture and the sumptuous Intermezzo. His feeling for the pace of the drama is ideal; propulsive, but with plenty of detail and poise. Excellent communication too between conductor and cast, another plus for this ensemble reading. All round, this is a musical performance characterised by power, focus and nuance – but it only serves to highlight how those qualities are lacking in the production itself.@saquabote",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/manon-lescaut-royal-opera-0,3
165,"Simplicius Simplicissimus, Independent Opera",Simplicius Simplicissimus,Independent Opera,2016-11-15,Helen Wallace,"“Not as a pleasurable play, but…an urgent message…” So composer Karl Amadeus Hartmann described his caustic chamber opera Simplicius Simplicissimus, receiving its UK premiere at Sadler’s Wells 81 years late. Five years before Brecht used the Thirty Years War for Mother Courage, Hartmann found in its orgy of brutality a resonance with the rise of National Socialism. His libretto sets part of Grimmelshausen’s 17th-century picaresque tale of a holy fool whose innocence protects him in a world of mercenary violence. Polly Graham’s explosively physical production for Independent Opera harnesses its outrage to fiery effect.Designer Nate Gibson locates the action in the attic of a bombed-out house, hanging precariously out across half the stage, strewn with leather suitcases, hiding-place of Simplicius (persuasively boyish Stephanie Corley, part Just William, part Sue Perkins). It’s a platform subject to continual assault from every angle in a helter-skelter of brilliantly choreographed scenes (by Michael Spenceley). As a sulphuric overture flickers into life, Simplicius is swept up in a vicious pantomime by the all-male chorus: attack, pillage, rape, starvation, children born and disposed of. We could be in Aleppo.In three acts our ""simplest simpleton"" encounters the barbaric Soldier (a menacing William Dazeley in tremendous voice, pictured below), Hermit, who shelters and teaches him, then dies in a lyric middle act (a querulous but touching Adrian Thompson) and the depraved Governor, who appoints him court jester (Mark Le Brocq, sinister in pink, a giant, bonneted baby orchestrating gang rape). The chorus hurtle in and out of the action, as soldiers, sheep and ingenious parts of society’s overburdened tree, which appears to Simplicius in a dream.There’s a streak of crude agit-prop theatre in the mix, with much of the text spoken: David Pountney’s translation is fresh, demotic, capturing the text’s brute misogyny (""Her curly hair is shiny like a pool of baby poo"") and cynicism (""Our Lord in heaven, hollow be thy name""). Graham deals with the two-dimensional nature of some scenes with physical theatre (including a supper eaten off dancer Chiara Vinci’s stretched, naked body), and artful but spare projection (Will Duke).Hartmann’s score is a knottier problem: interludes of serial, contrapuntal complexity grind against brittle Stravinskian marches and unmemorable songs on stage. A rag-bag of styles take us from the balm of a Bach chorale to locker-room polka (""Fornication is woman’s occupation"") with no strong sense of overarching structure. The scoring (here in its enlarged 1957 version, with added percussion) is alive with arresting sonorities: flutter-tongued trumpet and flute against muted strings as a nightingale sings, a mournful viola arioso rising out of percussive splinters. Hartmann, like Hindemith, was at his best in a lament, and his most haunting music comes at the Hermit’s death, when Simplicius sings a cantilena for his deliverance in a halo of eery gongs. Here, Corley gives sonorous weight to the work’s one emotional centre.But for all Timothy Redmond’s galvanising authority, this soloistic scoring is cruelly exposing, and the Britten Sinfonia didn't sound sufficiently prepared, something which can only improve in further performances. Hartmann demands fiendish attention to detail, even though his musical goals can seem elusive and unyielding. This is a brave, furious protest from a composer who chose – and survived –  ""internal emigration"". But its revolutionary climax feels generic. Hartmann would not lend his talent to the theatre again.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/simplicius-simplicissimus-independent-opera,3
166,"Lulu, English National Opera",Lulu,English National Opera,2016-11-10,David Nice,"After a day of sheer pain, would it be endless night or cathartic relief at ENO? Both, must be the answer, and much more, all at once. Iconoclastic Frank Wedekind's ""earth-spirit"" Lulu, exploited as a street-child but now able to turn the tables for a while on male bourgeois weakness, lives through one horrible situation after another before dying at the hands of Jack the Ripper, but Alban Berg's never merely atonal score gives such transcendent warmth to the spell she casts just by being.Has it ever sounded more grounded in its beauty, or more closely connected with the stage shenanigans, than it is here under Mark Wigglesworth, in what is – ""tragically"" might not be too strong a word – his last opera as ENO Music Director? And could anyone else rivet your attention quite so compellingly given the rival claims of genius artist-director William Kentridge's almost indigestible vision, the only possible supplanter of Richard Jones's unforgettable ENO predecessor (also enriched by Richard Stokes's acrid translation)?Like Carmen, the operatic Lulu mustn't 'do' sex but be it Throughout Act One, it all seemed as if it might be too much. Compelling from the start is the kaleidoscope of video-projected, sometimes animated black-ink portraits over print, reworkings of German expressionist masterworks which just needed to speak for themselves to remind you that men had the upper hand in studying each other in the 1920s and 30s while women were still just sex-objects. But it could afford to settle for some of the often oblique action, where the comic-grotesque doesn't always have space to breathe, and frankly we don't need anything more during the first two interludes.In fact I had to stop looking during the initial unfolding of the Mahlerian Adagio which represents the inexorable bond between Lulu and ""the only man who ever loved me"", Dr Schön. Not difficult to fix attention on the pit since Wigglesworth is in his element here, drawing the kind of deep sound from an ever more magnificent ENO Orchestra which first harrowed us when he came to the Coliseum to conduct Shostakovich's Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk for the first time in 2001.The spider-web of sound, though, quite different from Pappano's more lightly sensuous approach for Christof Loy's stripped-down Royal Opera Lulu, is only half the story. What we take for granted is the total music-theatre cohesion between voices and orchestra, which never failed us in the five previous productions Wigglesworth has conducted in his short-lived role. It reaches its apogee here, starting with the crisp delivery of David Soar's Animal-Tamer presenter. He's the first of many ludicrously self-important men in the opera, including the same singer's second role as athlete Rodrigo (pictured right with Sarah Connolly as Countess Geschwitz), a superbly relaxed physical as well as vocal performance.Lulu herself has to be the lynchpin, a killingly demanding high coloratura role. No singers capable of its stratospheric demands are going to have a big voice, and Brenda Rae has to work all her resources to be heard in mid-range in the vast spaces of the Coliseum. But her musicianship and accuracy are just phenomenal, and what's more, she treads the fine line any Lulu must negotiate, but very few do, between knowingness and simply existing as love-object; like Carmen, the operatic Lulu mustn't ""do"" sex but be it. Not for Rae the implied blankness of the strange child-woman's reactions to the deaths of the men who kill themselves for her. There's an existential despair you really believe in, even if the men on stage don't notice it. And the last-act fall from Parisian society hostess to East End prostitute, where the real tragedy is having to sell what Lulu's always been able to give increasingly on her own terms, is as harrowing as it can be.By this stage, Kentridge's bewilderingly rich design-concept, potent in its leitmotivic use of painted ""heads"" and giant hands, is perfectly fused with the interaction of characters (what the Germans call personenregie). Predictably, its apogee has been the rendering of the famous film sequence at the heart of the opera – unfathomably a visual blank in Jones's production – where the music is a perfect palindrome: again there are references to the masterworks of Weimar Germany, in this case recreation of scenes from Pabst's Wedekind-faithful silent film Pandora's Box. But no director just interested in the visuals would be able to order the salon mayhem (pictured below) of the first scene completed by Friedrich Cerha long after Berg's death in 1935 to give the opera the complete symmetry it always cried out for.The company work here of ENO artists as socialites running to the roulette tables and hungry for Jungfrau shares which of course crash horribly operates at the highest level, as always in these last glory days of a company on the verge of Brexit-like self-harm; it's a shame that there are too many good cameos to mention. And from this point on, I think, we buy into the initially distracting Lulu double at the side(s) of the stage who's started out as ordered pianist before mirroring and reacting to the abysmal trajectory of the play-within-a-play's heroine. Whatever you think of this second protagonist, she's mesmerisingly played by actor/dancer Joanna Dudley.Essentially these are the only two figures on stage allowed to develop. The men and the devoted lesbian Countess Geschwitz, lustrously sung as ever by Sarah Connolly in a satisying deconstruction of Coral Browne's character from The Killing of Sister George, all wear the same costumes throughout. The preposterousness and the pretensions of the male perspective are more strongly drawn than usual; even while Nicky Spence stylishly negotiates the cruelly high demands of Berg's seeming alter ego Alwa, Dr Schön's pettish son, you wince at the artistic terms in which he and Michael Colvin's short-lived, self-absorbed Painter see Lulu. As, it finally occurred to me this time round, you're supposed to.Sinister old abusive father-figure Schigolch doesn't have the usual dimension of creepy-comic asthmatic, underlined in the music, but in Willard White's inexorable hands is a powerful manipulator pure and simple. Only James Morris (pictured above with Rae, Dudley to the right), long past his famous Wotan years, is unsympathetically wooden as the unfathomable great love of Lulu's life.That undercuts something of the power of the dead Schön's return as Jack the Ripper, but in the resurrection of previous ""victims"" as ""clients"" – no disguises here – the clarity of Wigglesworth's outlines leaves us spellbound by the power of musical reminiscence. Maybe that's because I have come to know the score better over the years, but if anyone can help you to grasp it, he can. And this is a show you have to go and see again to begin to gather in all its riches. Don't miss the Kentridge exhibition at the Whitechapel, either.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/lulu-english-national-opera,5
167,"Oreste, Royal Opera, Wilton's Music Hall",Oreste,Royal Opera,2016-11-09,David Nice,"Human sacrifice and long-term reconciliation are serious matters for music-drama. Not that you'd know it from Handel's pasticcio or confectionary of previous operatic hits, nor from Gerard Jones's one-note production. For strip-cartoon violence Tarantino-style you need panache, and there’s little of that here. Interesting, too, that Handel gets hardly a look-in throughout the interview Jones the Younger gives in the programme. More important, does he serve the fledgling dramatic abilities of fellow trainees on the Royal Opera's Jette Parker Young Artists Programme? No, but these already accomplished singers are always fine if not entirely idiomatic in the multiple arias.The story is the same in outline as the Greek myth at the heart of Gluck's Iphigénie en Tauride: a fury-haunted Orestes turns up on the Crimean shore where his long-suffering sister is foreigner-slaying high priestess to a bloodthirsty Scythian (here, African dictator), Thoas. Anna Fleischle's classical designs for the English Touring Opera production of Gluck’s austere masterpiece would have fitted the former temple of music-hall at Wilton's much better than what Jones has come up with as co-designer with Matt Carter: a tagged, grungy space better suited to a multi-storey car-park as venue. Dry ice and a generator-like buzzing at the back of the stage were ominous signs from the start. And I'd never have guessed until I saw her take a bow that the masterly Mimi Jordan Sherin was responsible for the lighting.Within this awkward framework, tatty inhabitants perform clinical ritual sacrifice that ought to shock but only come across as dimly comical – ""I've always liked that place where 'not funny' meets 'funny',"" says Jones in the programme, but he has a long way to go to replicate the lesson of his master, Richard the Great – while two of the strangers from Argos are similarly raggle-taggle refugees. Not, oddly, Hermione, daughter of Helen and here married, with precedent in another part of the mythic canon, to cousin Orestes. She, at least, is the only character according to Jones who undergoes any sort of change, from prim pearl-necklaced society girl to hammer-wielding harpy. Certainly not right for the one who gets the most plangent music, and participates in the only duet, ""Ah, mia cara"", the best-known recycling (from Floridante) which would be occasion for heartfelt relief if Jones weren’t bent on pointing out the misalliance of the related husband and wife.If only Handel were as concise as Gluck. If anything gives licence to cut, it's a pasticcio. By running the first two long acts together, Jones has you wilting in sympathy with the poster of Diana that last night drooped and finally fell off the wall during a prime candidate for the snip, the otiose Act 2 aria for henchman Filotete. Frothy longer Handel always calls for two intervals and this show needs them more than most.One constant source of admiration even in the audience’s darkest moments is the neat little band of young professionals, the Southbank Sinfonia, conducted by the hyper-alert James Hendry. He seems to know every word not just of the arias but also of the recits, intriguingly and sometimes mysteriously accompanied by Nick Fletcher. The string quintet achieves wonders, very marked if you’re sitting as I was virtually alongside them to the right of the stage. Handel’s bottom lines are always a marvel to hear, and very impressively handled here by a single cello and double bass, but there was a lovely duet for two trilling violins to accompany Ermione, and some ravishing chord progressions in Pilade’s Act Two aria of adoration for his beloved Oreste. Here tenor Thomas Atkins achieved the softest singing in a vocally loud evening, and artistry to match the da capo ornamentations of Jennifer Davis as Ifigenia (pictured below).Handel might not seem natural territory for Vlada Borovko, the Ermione; she has energy and commitment but just a hint of under-the-noteness which may be a question of support. Angela Simkin, compelled to mutter and twitch throughout in response to the furies in Oreste’s head, has lustre but could go for a little more subtlety at times. Simon Shibambu’s tyrant gets some ridiculous routines – apparently there's a movement director, Anjali Mehra – and needs to keep an ear open for the band. Less would be more from Gyula Nagy’s sidekick, who’d chew a rug if there were one to go with Toante’s Act Two lampshade and foxhead.Jones may wear you down, but he has a clever solution, deliberately disjunct with Handel’s happy ending, for what a group of deranged folk is to do after all that slaughter; not the redemption of romance which is the usual role of Oreste’s reconciliation with his sister (but then Handel doesn’t seem interested in that anyway, alas). Atkins’ Pylade finally decides to get the hell out of there, don his lifejacket and presumably swim to New Zealand. This morning, I know how he feels.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/oreste-royal-opera-wiltons-music-hall,3

We tumble from love affair to love affair, lusting, losing and leaving three women in barely three hours, before taking peevish refuge in the comforts of art. John Schlesinger’s 1980 production may have its visual compensations, but lively it ain’t (barely alive at all, at times), and now on its eighth revival is looking decidedly arthritic. Thanks to tenor Vittorio Grigolo, however, it’s sounding pretty damn fine.There’s good and bad here, but the good is overwhelmingly about Grigolo. We’ve seen some less than subtle acting from the Italian tenor on this stage, heard some singing verging on the vulgar, but here he reins it in dramatically while giving his absolute all vocally, and it’s a winning balance. Bright and resonant, flung out to the very back of the house, Grigolo’s voice has never sounded healthier – the musical embodiment of that restless energy and ardent emotional drive that propels Offenbach’s opera. He croons in pianissimos more fragile than the consumptive Antonia, and turns up the comedy for a riotous Kleinzach. This is a bravura performance pitched at a different dramatic volume to almost everyone else on stage. If it doesn’t quite chime as previous performances have with Schlesinger’s vision of a grey-haired, broken and retrospective Hoffmann, then it hardly seems to matterA strong cast on paper doesn’t quite gel in performance. Thomas Hampson’s three villains may be a charismatic, Met-honed product but there’s no getting away from the fact that he still lacks the raw bass colour and power at the bottom of the register that makes them so menacing. Likewise the deliciously boyish Kate Lindsey (pictured below) – singing with such character and energy – nevertheless feels strained by the slightly low-lying role of sidekick Niklausse, dwarfed by some of the bigger voices on stage.Hoffmann’s three beloveds are split, as in previous revivals, between three different singers. Christine Rice (pictured below with Thomas Hampson) returns as the courtesan Giulietta – queenly and poised, though I’m not sure I still wouldn’t prefer a soprano in the role, with Sofia Fomina delivering a slightly pinched performance as mechanical doll Olympia, making heavy weather of “Les oiseaux dans la charmille”. Sonya Yoncheva offers an exciting musical climax (in this traditional ordering of the acts) as Antonia, but there’s a certain wildness to the very top of the voice that feels uneasily confined in this demure role.Legend has built up around William Dudley’s designs for Giulietta’s act – a gorgeous Venetian palazzo, complete with bacchanale and passing gondolas – and it still does the business. But although his three-level set proves wonderfully adaptable (though hardly swiftly adaptable, if the lengthy scene-changing pauses are anything to go by), the other two acts scarcely reach anything like the same level, and dimly lit by David Hersey it’s often hard to see precisely what’s going on in their many dark recesses.It’s hard to see what revival director Daniel Dooner has done here, though perhaps the stiff and jerky action on stage is simply the mirror of conductor Evelino Pido’s deeply unsympathetic tempi. Act I was a battle between singers and pit, with major interpretative disagreements played out over the course of more than one aria. Hopefully this will settle, but it’s hard to believe it will ever have that instinctive shimmy and prance that this responsive score can have at its best.This Hoffmann is still a solid piece of spectacle, but surely an opera so taken up with illusion and appearance, with phantasmagoria and fantasy, deserves something shinier? This is analogue Offenbach; it will be fascinating to see what the Royal Opera can come up with for the digital age.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/les-contes-dhoffmann-royal-opera,3
169,"Maria de Rudenz, Wexford Festival Opera",Maria de Rudenz,Wexford Festival Opera,2016-11-01,alexandra Coghlan,"Given the horrors lurking in the composer’s more familiar operas, the warning that Maria de Rudenz is “perhaps the darkest of Donizetti’s tragedies” carries no little weight. A Gothic spectacular with echoes of The Castle of Otranto and Matthew Lewis’s The Monk, Maria’s dramatic excess is tempered by a fine score, full of atmospheric chorus writing and some particularly lovely arias for baritone. Staged by the same team that delivered the ghostly fantasy of a Guglielmo Ratcliff at last year’s festival, the opera is a stylish Halloween hit, welcome as trick or treat candy, but dissolving just as swiftly in the mouth.Fabio Ceresa’s gorgeous wreck of a set places Maria, her lover Corrado and cousin Matilde in a crumbling 19th-century dolls’ house – playthings, one assumes, for a particularly malign and vindictive fate, who twists and turns the interiors like a living Escher landcape. All the Gothic tricks and tropes are here – flickering candles, mysterious doppelgangers, ghostly apparitions and scheming relatives – presented with a mock-serious relish that sits somewhere between Tim Burton and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It’s nicely judged, just wry enough to puncture the plot’s essential foolishness without completely blunting the emotional conviction of the warped love that drives this dark take.Having run away from her disapproving father with her lover Corrado, Maria finds herself abandoned to die in the Venetian catacombs when Corrado suspects her of infidelity. Believing her dead, he returns to Rudenz castle to marry her cousin Matilde, keen to be spared the life of the convent, only to find himself confronted by the very much alive (if lightly maimed) Maria.It’s not a vintage plot, but it does the job, providing a dramatic scaffolding just strong enough to support some glorious music. It helps that Wexford has assembled a superb cast, led by Korean Joo Won Kang’s radiant Corrado. How rare to have a Donizetti baritone role of such meatiness, and how wonderful to have a singer to take full advantage of that – even from top to bottom, and with a lovely sense of line through even the fussiest of passages. His opening “Eglia, ancora non giunge” was a stand-out.The doll-like stiffness of Gilda Fiume’s Maria (pictured above) here generates a curious friction with Donizetti’s dynamic vocal writing. Her agile voice roams widely, exploring all possible outlying emotions, while she herself remains physically confined. Trapped in this domestic prison, she projects her emotional adulthood, the maturity the separates her from the uncanny dolls all around, by sheer vocal force. Sophie Gordeladze’s Matilde is a more brittle affair, girlish and supple at the top of her range, a lovely vocal foil for Jesus Garcia’s lovelorn Enrico, smoothly sung throughout.The Wexford Chorus provide the castle’s many disturbing attendants, singing strongly (often in separate male and female choruses) under conductor Andrew Greenwood, while the highlight from the pit is the glorious bass clarinet solo that opens Act Two. Nicely paced and judiciously trimmed, Donizetti’s gothic horror here sets ears tingling and skin crawling, just as it should.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/maria-de-rudenz-wexford-festival-opera-0,4
170,"Alcina, RAM, Round Chapel, Hackney",Alcina,RAM,2016-10-25,alexandra Coghlan,"Handel’s Alcina is about sex, certainly. But unlike Olivia Fuchs’s new production for the Royal Academy of Music, it’s about an awful lot of other things as well. Power, illusion, ageing, love, gender, family, intimacy – all these themes find themselves transformed on Alcina’s magical island, reworked by the end into ideas that are altogether darker and more complicated. But there’s nothing complicated about this vision. Stylish and conceptually clever, it’s a production that literally strips down to its skimpies in the first five minutes and grinds its interesting bits in your face, leaving precious little to reveal over the remaining two and a half hours.Fuchs transforms Hackney’s Round Chapel into a fetish club – the suggestively named “Amnesio”. A circular island of a stage is suspended in a sea of oversized balloons (echoes of the Royal Opera’s 2010 Niobe), glowing neon-bright under Jake Wiltshire’s lighting scheme. Queuing to enter are a motley collection of punks and goths, all piercings, latex, faux-fur and fuck-me boots in Yannis Thavoris’s exuberant designs. Alcina’s magical hold over them becomes clear in a vivid coke-snorting episode, and only Red Bull can bring these coked-up slaves to pleasure back to their senses.The result in such a booming church acoustic is perpetual clattering, clomping and slammingAs an opening gambit it’s an interesting one, but Fuchs does little with it, forced over the course of a deftly cut few hours to repeat actions again and again, desperately filling time on this tricky stage space. Steeply raked and full of trap doors, the stage becomes a battleground for young singers, who must negotiate its steep surface in all kinds of unhelpful footwear and uncooperative clothing, all while trying to impress vocally. The result in such an unhelpfully booming church acoustic (why programme an opera in here at all, with so many more conventional theatres on offer?)  is perpetual clattering, clomping and slamming, obliterating much of the music. The beautiful violin solo in Morgana’s “Ama, sospira” was crushed underfoot, and an extended episode of newspaper ripping in Bradamante’s “Vorrei vendicarmi” all but did for that aria too.The whole affair felt downright unkind to young singers, whose professional showcase this is. Instead of a powerful, seductive enchantress, Meinir Wyn Roberts’s Alcina looked like an awkward teenager in borrowed clothes, going through the motions of grinding, stripping and seducing but without conviction or emotion. Vocally she seemed rattled, and it took until after the interval (bizarrely placed just before Alcina’s “Ah! Mio cor”, denying Roberts any emotional run-up to this extended lament) for intonation and delivery to settle. Once they did, however, things improved enormously, revealing a generous voice to come.Much more consistent were Lorena Paz Nieto’s minxy Morgana (pictured above) – all effervescent coloratura and attitude – and Emma Stannard’s Ruggiero. Stannard’s is a warm and wonderfully even mezzo, with a muscularity that made much of this confused young man’s many identities. Forced to wear a motorcycle helmet for “Sta nell’Ircana” (who would so wilfully diminish the resonance of a singer going up against two solo horns?), she summoned all her swagger to push through. William Blake impressed as the faithful Oronte, and Richard Walshe made a strong impression in the bit-part of Melisso.Speeds throughout were frisky, risking a loss of clarity and line in this unhelpful acoustic, and it took Iain Ledingham’s strings a long while to gel, not helped, presumably, by the ambient temperature of an unheated venue. To have so much vocal talent and squander it in a venue so ill-designed for opera seems a wilful decision on the part of the Royal Academy. Yes this Alcina looks good, but if it can’t be heard clearly then it rather defeats the object.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/alcina-ram-round-chapel-hackney,3
171,"The Nose, Royal Opera",The Nose,Royal Opera,2016-10-21,David Nice,"Even that most unpredictable of fantasists Nikolay Gogol might have been surprised to find his Nose, wandering far from the face of Collegiate Assessor Kovalyov, sung by a high tenor in an unlikely operatic adaptation of his wackiest story. Give the singing role, as Barrie Kosky does, to another character, and show the giant-sized Nose – here a boy dancer – without any token apparel of his supposed high rank before which lowly official Kovalov absurdly grovels, and you miss the point of a vintage scene in Shostakovich's The Nose. Fortunately Kosky has plenty of ingenious riffs of his own, not least turning the spectacle into an opera-ballet, but the dance is better and funnier than some of the music-theatre singing.Take two crucial claims – one by the composer, one by this director – and it's not hard to see that Kosky might have gone a little wrong. True, it's the putative Shostakovich of Testimony, that much-disputed volume, who declares that ""The Nose is a horror story, not a joke...Without a nose you are not a human being"", but that rings true of a composer who was in one respect Gogol's musical double and understood him well.The horror isn't headlined here. Kovalyov is a puffed up and then deflated clown – highlighted by him taking on a red nose rather than a bandaged flat-face – but Shostakovich gives him music at times of pathos as well as of desperation. A characterisation to match was there when Moscow Chamber Orchestra's landmark production carried on doing the rounds in the 1990s. Here, though, none of this comes across in the way the excellent Martin Winkler (pictured right with John Tomlinson) is asked to play him: sung with some nuance certainly; grotesque, yes, and frenzied; but pitiable, no.Then there's Kosky's assertion in a programme interview that ""the piece is like an enormous locomotive that goes at a very fast pace"". Frankly I've never found the work of a fitfully brilliant 20-year-old to work in that way; it could be shorter by a third and it probably needs a smaller scale production to move more nimbly. Yet by any standards several key scenes – above all the one where Kovalyov goes to a newpaper office to place an ad about his missing appendage – drag and pall. Not even Winkler and the ever-adaptable John Tomlinson can save that one. Ingo Metzmacher's conducting could certainly do with more definition at times, though he handles the crowd scenes well with strong participation from chorus and bit-part players. Even there Kosky departs from what's actually supposed to be happening and leaves us intermittently puzzled.The highlight is choreographer Wolfgang Pichler's realisation of Kosky's vaudeville touches: Beryl Cook ""ladies"" in fur coats reveal Ann Summers underwear before executing to the extraordinary percussion-only interlude a kind of Verdi-Macbeth witches' invocation of the giant Nose (pictured above). It later multiplies – you could perhaps see it coming, but it's a brilliant interpolation all the same – into one interlude Shostakovich couldn't have envisaged, a tap-dancing number which is rightly a hit with the audience. Buki Shiff's exuberant costumes within the circles and on the round tables of Klaus Grünberg's set range from black and white, with an out-front chorus line surely indebted to images of Meyerhold's famous production of Gogol's Government Inspector, to dayglo colours, which save the last crowd scene from disintegration; a humiliated Kovalyov himself takes on the historical cameo of Persian prince Khozrev Mirza as a circus's star attraction.The comic delivery comes and goes from the supporting cast, all sporting outsized noses. Peerless Wolfgang Ablinger-Sperrhacke as servant-catamite Ivan makes deliciously smarmy work of a song accompanied by balalaika-strumming Russian folk dolly and hams it up with licence. Susan Bickley puts across a nonsense scene as an old countess with panache (pictured above), and though the words of the other women can't always be heard, Rosie Aldridge does a very funny job of microphone-wielding compère trying to bring the show to a close with Gogol's own words before Kosky offers a final twist (or you could say a falling-off).There are, of course, plenty of licences in David Pountney's translation. It was surely right for the Royal Opera to perform the work in English, as they had Prokofiev's The Gambler. I just wish the words fitted the music better (they're not as perfectly tailored in the original as Prokofiev's Musorgskyan speech-melody absolutely is, but there aren't quite so many false stresses). Who knows, given the audience response this one may run and run - there, a predictable Nose pun at last - but frankly its wit is not always of the sharpest and the momentary depths remain unplumbed. I only wonder what Richard Jones or Simon McBurney might have made of it.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/nose-royal-opera,3
172,"Billy Budd, Opera North",Billy Budd,Opera North,2016-10-19,David Nice,"""That cursed mist"" may hide the French from the crew of the HMS Indomitable and cause far more deadly damage to moral certainty. But clarity and strength are the assets of Orpha Phelan's new production for Opera North: no gimmicks, superb company work and three principals for the battle of good and evil all equal to their dramatic challenges at a level I haven't seen for decades.Britten and his co-librettists EM Forster and Eric Crozier pose some challenges in their adaptation of Melville's story, all well handled here: there's a bit too much moralising, especially about avenging angels and the idea that a stammer is a flaw in the divine scheme (well, it does prove fatal, but no-one's to know that in Act One), while the first half - which started out as two separate acts - takes a long time just drawing up the psychological lines of battle. But the screw turns inexorably once beauty-envious Master-at-Arms John Claggart, his ""sexuality gone soggy"" as Forster put it, accuses press-ganged foundling Billy, goodness personified, of insubordination. That's when upright Captain Vere falls into confusion, and the needle of the moral compass goes spinning.The opera frames the action with the tortured memories of old Vere, wandering a crumbling mansion of the mind. Its grey walls remain a framework for the action on the ship: no masts and sails here, only hammocks, but Leslie Travers' spiral of splintering planks delineates above and below decks with startling simplicity, his costumes colour-scheme in greys, whites and blues with significant splashes of red, and Thomas C Hase's superb lighting, especially fine on giant shadows, does the rest. There are no surprises other than the famous interlude of major and minor triads - Opera North first trumpet infallibly secure in high-lying notes - when Vere goes to talk to the condemned Budd; usually it's left to the imagination, and the possibility of the ""love that dare not speak its name"", whereas here the captain goes to sit quietly alongside the able seaman, backs to the audience.Phelan, significantly, is the only woman in the company other than movement director Lynne Hockney and some of the orchestral players; she should give us an interesting Don Giovanni where male directors have made too much of the running. She doesn't need to do much other than block effectively and depend on the interaction of fine singing actors.Each gets his moment in the sun or the dark, even if all three strain on a top note or two - a very small reservation, as they mostly make the problem work for them dramatically. Alastair Miles (pictured above, right, with Alan Oke's Captain Vere), a true world-class bass of the colour the villain needs, has Claggart break out of his stiff public persona to terrifying effect in his monologue of hatred and envy, twisting Billy's red neckerchief in his hands and making a curse over it; for the first time, Garry Walker's razor-sharp Opera North players let rip, too. Goosebumps all round. Alan Oke is perfect of diction and demeanour, too, starting out as a wry, cultured observer of human nature, precise but never prissy, whose breakdown is shocking, both in his climactic soliloquy and in the slow crumpling of his face and body as he conducts Billy's court martial.Roderick Williams' innocent who lashes out - not sure (spoiler) why the audience laughed when Claggart is pronounced dead - really is goodness personified, perhaps without the homoerotic element which Phelan downplays. His reactions to everything are strong and true - like Phyllida Lloyd's Opera North Gloriana, this production would be a superb candidate for the close-ups of a film - and his supreme Lieder-singer's subtlety gives us the most cultured and moving ""Billy in the Darbies"" I've seen or heard (Williams pictured right). It's the first time, other than the Prologue, when a single figure is alone on stage; sailors are symmetrically present forming a cordon around Captain Vere's cabin, Phelan reminding us of the balances in Britten's careful structure.Otherwise there are plenty of standouts among the many other grateful roles. Baritone Gavan Ring as the tender friend of the lashed Novice is surely a Billy-in-waiting. Special character comes from Adrian Clarke's Flint, Daniel Norman's Red Whiskers and David Llewellyn's Squeak. Stephen Richardson's Dansker and Oliver Johnston's Novice could yet fine-tune their sympathy, but both are moving.The final word goes to Vere, whose musical liberation if not the words that go with it makes complete sense in Walker's postponement of the biggest climax to the last well-timed shattering chord. But the male chorus, presumably Opera North's plus extra voices, leaves its mark, too - hard-working, fearless and spine-tingling. This is their moment indeed, as Suor Angelica was for the women; together they will make a huge impact in The Snow Maiden and Turandot, still to come in an Opera North season of vision. The current management of English National Opera, further depriving its own chorus of any significant participation this season by having allegedly just denied them a role in Carousel, should look north to a peerless example of a valued company and hang its head in shame.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/billy-budd-opera-north,4
173,"Madama Butterfly, Glyndebourne Tour",Madama Butterfly,Glyndebourne Tour,2016-10-15,David Nice,"What would Glyndebourne, staging Madama Butterfly for the first time, bring to Puccini's most heartbreaking tragedy? Subtle realism, perhaps? Certainly the composer, along with his superb librettists Giacosa and Illica, offers plenty of opportunities. Yet director Annilese Miskimmon botches nearly every significant moment, and it's surely her fault if her three principals are as wooden as the suggestion of lacquered trees dominating the sets.Vocally, at least, this was a respectable evening, occasionally a little more than that. Korean soprano Karah Son can fill high-lying phrases with impassioned vibrancy, so that even when stagewise she's not properly supported - in ""Un bel di"", for instance, delivered to the audience, not as a repeated narrative to maid Suzuki (Claudia Huckle, sympathetic but under-used), who for some unfathomable reason has just left the stage - she can come close to moving us. She's the most plausible-looking 15-year-old bride in Act One, too, highlighting a layer of queasiness in callow Lieutenant Pinkerton's marriage of brief convenience we don't usually get. But when we see Butterfly the woman after three years of desertion, Son doesn't have anywhere near the fullness of middle and lower range for deeper feelings and temporary control of her unfortunate situation.Matteo Lippei's Pinkerton is a stock, ardent tenor without a trace of charisma or plausible remorse when the consequences of his return hit home. The Sharpless of Francesco Verna - another of those Italian baritones, like Alessio Arduini in the Royal Opera's Così fan tutte, with a shade more vibrato in the voice than is quite healthy in a youngish singer - proves a cipher of a consul when he should be a sympathetic voice speaking out against imperialist bad behaviour. But then early contrasts between him and his fellow American are defused when we're distracted by a slideshow of prospective Japanese brides (pictured above).Later, in the love duet, we get an even more irrelevant film of GI brides sailing to America - never a prospect for this Butterfly, so rather pointless - as part of Miskimmon's 1950s setting. Act One is set in Goro's marriage bureau somewhere - presumably, from the neon signs on the brick wall at the back, the red-light district - in downtown Nagasaki. This poses only problems when the setting is supposed to be the new home for Butterfly and Pinkerton on a hill overlooking the harbour. The ascent of the girls can't have any perfumed visual atmosphere in this enclosed setting, and connections with who comes up the hill in Act Two are weakened. All the smaller roles are under-directed, so none of those singers makes the desired impact.Designer Nicky Shaw's trees - odd decorative bureau-design until first-act magical realism briefly takes over - look as if they might be more promising in conjunction with the sliding-screen house in Act Two. But the acting area in front of the dwelling is a bit of a dead space where Butterfly entertains Sharpless - having asked him to come in - and where the garden, presumed beyond it (odd), yields only a few handfuls of cherry blossom rather than the flowers Butterfly orders Suzuki to gather for Pinkerton's arrival.Topography is uncertain. Presumably when Butterfly ""sees"" the details of Pinkerton's ship she's doing it from memory, but with Suzuki looking to the back of the stage and her mistress out front, it doesn't work.The tableau with the mother leading her child slowly towards the back of the stage (pictured above) is briefly lovely, but nothing is ever stronger than the sight of maid and boy fast asleep while Butterfly holds her night watch. We don't get Suzuki, there's no kneeling or lying down and the dawn dropcloth - making sense at last - is used instead of the much more powerful picture of the waiting woman with her thoughts and emotions reflected in the interlude.This and the Humming Chorus before it, at least, are John Wilson's finest stretches in an interpretation of the score which is always lithe and mostly light, but somehow misses the sensuousness and - surprisingly for this conductor - a sense of theatrical peaks. As yet, the orchestra, good but not outstanding, doesn't move quite as one with the singers; that may come (and Gareth Hancock conducts no less than eight of the tour performances).Tears, big emotions? Not for me, very rare in this ultimately very brutal drama, though the dead spaces of shattered illusion (Son and Huckle pictured above) did begin to hit home in Wilson's sensitive handling. Why, though, make Kate Pinkerton an ice-cold Hitchcock blonde? It's surely much more affecting for her to feel the awkwardness of the situation as much as anyone. And the suicide is the final death-blow of Miskimmon's staging, having bloody Butterfly stumble out from behind the screens with her little battleship to die alongside her boy, who's playing with a bigger version. Not convincing, not shocking, like far too much of this missed opportunity to turn the nuanced screw on a masterpiece.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/madama-butterfly-glyndebourne-tour,3
174,"The Fairy Queen, AAM, Barbican",The Fairy Queen,AAM,2016-10-11,alexandra Coghlan,"Purcell’s The Fairy Queen is a riddle to which directors must find an answer. The problems posed by a work whose theatrical characters have no foothold in the musical interludes, whose text is an awkward composite of almost-Shakespeare and not-at-all-Shakespeare, whose unedited action can easily swell to a will-sapping four hours are not to be underestimated, but to address them by adding further narrative layers, further dramatic frames and meta-theatrical flummery is at best questionable and at worst wilful.Faced with the challenge of Purcell’s semi-opera, Daisy Evans empties her director’s toolbox onto the stage, knocking through the fourth wall to create an all-purpose kitchen-diner of a concept in which all of Purcell’s characters and every stock theatrical gesture you can think of (fluttering paper birds, falling paper snow, ushers who suddenly turn actors, torches that become stars) must awkwardly coexist.This is a Fairy Queen as staged by contemporary Mechanicals. ""Stage crew"" wander around with the inevitable earpieces and skinny jeans, musicians burst in late, conductor Richard Egarr chats with a soloist who tries and tries to sing his entry without success. From this chaotic scene certain figures and relationships do gradually begin to coalesce. Rejecting both Shakespeare’s characters and Purcell’s, Evans makes stars of the stage-folk themselves, spinning a chaste love-triangle between a stage manager, a singer and a PA (Iestyn Davies, Rowan Pierce and Gwilym Bowen). As a guiding narrative thread through a piece that’s heavy with transgressive eroticism it’s pretty flimsy, and one that leads its audience further and further from the music itself.Drama is king in a staging that consistently mistrusts or distracts from the score. Singers must duet while miles apart and facing away from the conductor, arias are sung at the extremes of the stage (effectively inaudible to half the auditorium) or delivered to the percussive accompaniment of paper-ripping or the banging and shuffling of furniture removal. Occasionally narrator Timothy West even speaks over the music, delivering a motley collection of Shakespeare speeches and sonnets with little obvious connection to the action.It would be easier to forgive the direction if the music weren’t so very good. Egarr, the Academy of Ancient Music and a superb cast of young singers all deserve better than they get here. It all starts and ends with Egarr’s own continuo accompaniments, lively with the wit and whimsy that’s so conspicuously absent from the staging. The band match him for stylish shape-shifting, one minute a rustic wind-band for luckless shepherd Coridon, next ushering in the Masque of Night with the softest of string breaths. The chorus too, endlessly game and completely committed, sing exquisitely while performing a series of increasingly daft actions.With the drama so diffuse none of the principals gets much chance to show their skill, but Rowan Pierce makes a charming heroine, sweet and round of tone and a natural lyrical foil for Mhairi Lawson’s vivid, declamatory soprano. Pierce’s Plaint is a rare moment of musical and dramatic harmony, benefitting from a rare stillness that trusts Purcell’s music to work its spell. An underused Davies (pictured above with Charles Daniels and Ashley Riches) makes what he can of what little he’s given, throwing himself into the bungling courtship of Coridon and Mopsa with energy more than matched by his seducer Ashley Riches. Tenors Charles Daniels and Gwilym Bowen round out the solo ensemble, each at their most exciting in the anything-you-can-do duet “Let the fifes and the clarions”.This Fairy Queen marks the start of a cycle of Purcell semi-operas. Let’s hope for better next time.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/fairy-queen-aam-barbican,3
175,"Il Tabarro, Suor Angelica, Opera North",Il Tabarro,Suor Angelica,2016-10-03,graham Rickson,"Just two thirds of Puccini’s Il Trittico still makes for an involving evening’s entertainment. Without Gianni Schicchi there’s an awful lot of misery and heartache, though director Michael Barker-Caven does manage to inject some black comedy into this revival of Il Tabarro, originally directed by David Pountney in 2004.Johan Engels’ minimalist set suggests that we’re watching a film noir, and the cast deserve much credit for managing not to slip and tumble while negotiating its expressionist contours. Ivan Inverardi’s Michele (pictured below right) even resembles a 1940s movie villain, down to the hat and smoking habit. Giselle Allen’s Giorgetta has every right to be fed up, seeking consolation in the arms of David Butt Philip’s stevedore Luigi. There’s a fleeting moment when we feel a shred of pity for the cuckolded husband, but he blows it in just a few words after his downtrodden wife leaves the stage.The real hero is Puccini’s score, the opera’s Parisian canal setting the cue for some remarkably limpid, transparent music. Debussy and Ravel are the obvious influences, and there’s a nod to Petrushka early on. At one point La Frugola (the excellent Anne-Marie Owens) sings of her beloved cat, prompting a few seconds of realistic orchestral purring. Jac van Steen lets his orchestra off the leash in the fruitier climaxes, the bold colours in sharp contrast to the blended, impressionist textures which predominate. The grisly end is powerfully effective; we wince and grin when the eponymous cloak is pulled away to reveal Luigi’s limp corpse. Beautifully lit and snappily directed, this is superb stuff, the opera’s 55 minutes whizzing by.Barker-Caven’s mostly sensitive production of Suor Angelica is undermined by a grave misstep in the final minutes. Joining a nunnery has never seemed so unattractive. Most of this lot are engaged in mundane tasks whilst showing supreme indifference to real-life problems, illustrated by their disdain shown towards a hobbling penitent.Fiona Kimm’s haughty Abbess rules over a community where the simplest of pleasures and desires are frowned upon. Hannah Clark’s bleached stage design and austere costumes are stark but gorgeous, a sharp contrast to the score’s beguiling colours. Il Tabarro is all murky shadows; Suor Angelica a ravishing exploration of orchestral light, the divisi strings and tuned percussion providing a superb backdrop for Puccini’s all-female cast.Anne-Sophie Duprels’s Angelica (pictured left) is a standout, becoming more three-dimensional as her back story is revealed. There’s a superb turn from Patricia Bardon as the frosty aunt. Immaculately clad in vibrant yellows, she remains ice cold even when explaining the fate of Angelica’s illegitimate son. So much works beautifully – the offstage choral singing, boosted by members of the Opera North Children’s and Youth Choruses, is faultless, and van Steen’s pacing is ideal. But that closing sequence. Whoops! Angelica’s anguish as she realises there’s no turning back would be emotionally and musically devasting, were it not kiboshed by a technically startling but totally unnecessary light show. It’s as if Barker-Caven’s spent too much time watching Kubrick’s 2001. I'll say no more. Avert your eyes and just listen.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/il-tabarro-suor-angelica-opera-north,4
176,"Don Giovanni, English National Opera",Don Giovanni,English National Opera,2016-10-01,David Nice,"Pace-perfect musical articulation and meaningful surprises in the direction: both were to be expected after the conductor-generated sludge and the production overkill of the new Royal Opera Così fan tutte. Mark Wigglesworth has form in Mozart at ENO, with the best of Cosìs way back and a bewitching revival of The Magic Flute this year. Last night he and the ENO Orchestra put no foot wrong. Richard Jones, his dream first-time collaborator, offered the expected twists and symmetries though perhaps not all the connections in between. But that's the eternal problem of Don Giovanni for you.Much depends, for starters, on what you want from the opening scene. Surprise us, by all means, but I'm sure Mozart and his genius librettist Da Ponte intended that when a girl says no, she means no, and that if Donna Anna is discombobulated for the rest of the show, it's not surprising given that she’s dealing with attempted rape and the murder of her father in close succession. Not since Deborah Warner's fascinating Glyndebourne production have I seen genuine upset caused by a disguise in the dark, and while Jones didn't insult us with the post-coital contentment between Donna Anna and Don Giovanni too often proposed by male directors, his sado-masochistic set-up was an odd alternative.In true Jones style, it was immaculately prepared, by women in evening dress (Franco-era Spanish?) of all shapes and ages, and one gentleman with a disconcerting resemblance to ginger-wigged and bespectacled Leporello (Clive Bayley, pictured above with Christopher Purves), ""claimed"" in novel fashion by the great seducer. Leporello in turn is busy ushering these unlikely victims through the first door from the right and out again in seconds while the Overture, past its opening blast from hell, trills and titters. Nothing glamorous about this Giovanni, then.Those doors play an even bigger part in the action than they did in the Feydeau farce Jones directly so brilliantly in his early years. They're filled with red catalogues of conquests when Donna Elvira opens them during Leporello's ennumeration of his master's dubious accomplishments, and ultimately provide no escape for the servant himself when, in the opera's most famous scene, the statue of the avenging Commendatore comes to dinner. Paul Steinberg's deliberately drab hell-is-here-and-now sets, strip- or streetlamp-lit – unusual territory for Mimi Jordan Sherin – are coloured only by joyless party gimcrackery, flowers for the dead and food for the gourmet. The scene changes may look like a cut-price version of the enormously expensive ones in the Covent Garden Così, but the real human interest is never dwarfed here.We know where we are with the seven main personalities, all with their own distinctive body languages and never quite connecting with each other. Christopher Purves's ice-cold powermonger, a good deal older than his victims, drives them all mad - the men included – simply by being. I don't know who chose the lines in the programme from Edward St Aubyn's chilling novel Never Mind, but Purves's look, and the colder sounds he produces in his stock of vocal colour, correspond superbly with one sentence: ""Without his dark glasses, he wore an inattentive expression, until he spotted another person's vulnerability. Then the look in his eyes hardened like a flexed muscle”. This Giovanni has no redeeming charm, only dangerous charisma. His Leporello has the mirthless smiles of an Eric Morcambe, but not the wit: a vintage Jones creep, in short.If you don't quite buy the idea of a Donna Anna unbalanced by the death of a father who's seeing a hooker in the next room, yet carrying on a deception, manipulative rather than vulnerable, and Caitlin Lynch is stretched to her limits by the end, there's still much to enjoy in her energetic projection of the big Act One vengeance aria, incisive but with just enough space from Wigglesworth's vivid manoeuvering (Lynch in Act Two pictured above).He gets unbelievably dramatic playing from the ENO strings in the women's accompanied recitatives. The heart of the entire performance, the only point behind which real tragedy seems to lurk, comes in Elvira's heartbreak before the even more forceful dementedness of the Vienna number added to the original Prague score – the best of both is here in this edition – we know as ""Mi tradì"". Christine Rice, a mezzo in what we know as a soprano role (Mozart registered no such distinction) has the difficult task of acting mad throughout, but her vocal and dramatic vibrancy are magnificently sustained and the problematic vocal break between middle and upper registers seemed to have vanished in Act Two.Equal to Rice in style is Allan Clayton, playing Don Ottavio as a fiancé for Donna Anna with no more backbone than usual, but giving muscle to both the gentle and more formal set pieces in flawless long phrases while his loneliness is stressed by the way others ignore him. Mary Bevan as Zerlina brings similar energy, and no bland soubrette sweetness, to the challenge and later the consolation she gives to her Masetto (Nicholas Crawley, equally engaged), whose macho aggression crumbles convincingly after his beating. She's first seen crossing the stage as the only one in white just as Amanda Holden's brilliant translation of Leporello's Catalogue Aria introduces the type Giovanni likes best – the ""vergo intacta"" (Bevan, Crawley and Purves pictured below).By the midpoint of Act Two, all these would-be avengers are solipsistic and self-isolated, at a loss when the pursuit of the ""betrayer"" falters. The great sextet and the arias around it are pitch perfect, and up to that point Jones gets big laughs in what's usually the most otiose stretch of the opera, where Da Ponte had to pad out the groundplan of his source, a shorter Don Giovanni by one Gazzaniga, with routines of his own. All that's needed here are Leporello’s wig and glasses and a phone box; I won't divulge further, except to say that the phone comes back as a masterly device for Donna Anna to give a dumbfounded Ottavio the brush-off in the great aria familiar to most listeners as “Non mi dir”.All that focused animation at a difficult point is a reminder that this director and conductor excel where the musical drama is deemed to falter. Jones pulled off the same with a creepy party-scene in his production of Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades. The one here at the end of the first act, despite jiving masked figures straight out of David Hockney's Rake's Progress Bedlam, doesn't quite ""read"", though there's a lot going on; it's still infinitely better than Calixto Bieito's druggy shuffling about in one of many unsuccessful Don Giovannis at ENO.Come the banquet of Act Two, though, and the welcome splashes of colour as well as the knitting-together of several ideas pay off. It would be a grotesque spoiler to say what happens when the statue (pictured above) – James Cresswell’s indomitable stentorian bass at one with whiplash orchestra – does come to dinner. Suffice it to say that the young Leporello-alike we saw in the overture has a part to play in the final ensemble, where a certain part is cunningly reallocated.Vivacious to hear even when it looks pointedly drab, this Don Giovanni has its bafflements, but it's an often stunning, always fluent piece of work from all concerned. And just think: this could have been the start of a Wigglesworth-Jones Mozart-Da Ponte trilogy, possibly followed by a Wagner tetralogy, instead of which all those possibilities were thrown away. It seems hard to believe it’s too late for ENO, but we may just have to accept it.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/don-giovanni-english-national-opera-1,4
177,"Stravinsky: Myths and Rituals 5, Philharmonia, Salonen, RFH",Stravinsky: Myths and Rituals 5,Philharmonia,2016-09-30,Helen Wallace,"The Symphony of Psalms, which ended the Philharmonia’s Stravinsky series last night, is an indelible masterpiece, silencing the tired but persistent accusation that Stravinsky’s music is clever but cold. Abstract it may be, but suffused with an exile’s deep longing, spritual hope rising in harmonies of heart-stopping consolation until that final, revelatory C major chord. This performance (with three Swedish choirs) was of focused beauty and searing sincerity; I have never heard better. Its radical scoring sounded afresh, while spine-tingling intonation and conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen’s unforced mastery lent the whole a visionary power.In both this and Oedipus Rex which preceded it, Stravinsky adopted Latin for an archaic, incantatory quality. But, with Peter Sellars directing, this would be no objectified ritual. Could Stravinsky withstand being love-bombed by the master of the group-hug? The short answer is, yes, though there were moments when one had to look away.From the opening chorus of Oedipus the handsome Orphei Drängar male choir, in modern dress, were emoting every word in ""Sellars semaphore"". Well-honed from this summer’s production in Aix-en-Provence, they inhabited their parts with rare vibrancy and naturalness. When they pleaded, writhing and signing, with Oedipus (Joseph Kaiser) to deliver them from plague, their helplessness hit home. But when they launched into the fugue, we descended into a ludicrous orgy of heads-shoulders-knees-and-toes.The signing felt yet more superfluous in the Symphony of Psalms for which women from Gustaf Sjökvists Kammarkor and Sofia Vokalensemble joined, creating a marvellously clear blend. But Sellars’s interventions, however distracting, stem from a search for genuine connection, and if the signing of words played a part in this choir’s intense engagement, their achieved single, breathing organism, it was worth it.In this production the Symphony of Psalms forms the conclusion to Oedipus Rex: Sellars brings the blinded Oedipus on stage after his exile, and allows Antigone to quote from Oedipus at Colonus to describe his end. This move from the Ancient Greek into the Christian world is deft – Antigone’s speech elides into Psalm 150 – but problematic. Sellars is drawing on Stravinsky’s rediscovery of his Russian Orthodox faith in the 1920s, but it robs Oedipus Rex of its true, pitiless ending, offering him a Christian salvation.Staging was minimal but effectiveSellars also dispenses with Cocteau’s anonymous narrator in Oedipus Rex, and installs Antigone (the engaging Emily Barber) as the story-teller throughout the evening. Immediately, everything is urgently personal: it’s her father, her family, her suffering. That worked in Oedipus, less so in the Symphony, where she is quickly redundant. Here, the graceful dance of Ismene (Laurel Jenkins, pictured above) in the second movement was sufficient.Tenor Kaiser was an impressive, believable Oedipus, with noble bearing and a ringing vibrato, burning foil to Willard White’s commanding Creon, Tiresias and Messenger. Katarina Dalayman brought a tarnished beauty to Jocasta, while Joshua Stewart injected drama into his crucial appearance as the Shepherd. Staging was minimal but effective, broken only when White as Messenger finally moved out into the audience to call back to the choir in thrilling antiphony. A fitting end to this extraordinary series, which has done so much, so well, to restore to us Stravinsky in the round.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/stravinsky-myths-and-rituals-5-philharmonia-salonen-rfh,5
178,"Kiss Me, Kate, Welsh National Opera",Kiss Me,Kate,2016-09-30,stephen Walsh,"There are two ways of reacting to an opera company like WNO staging a musical like Kiss Me, Kate. You can ask yourself whether this is work that an opera house should concern itself with at all. Or you can take Confucius’s advice, and just lie back and enjoy it. Of course you could say the same if WNO put on an air display or a cricket tournament. But at least Cole Porter is sung drama of a kind, which is one definition of opera, and it’s also on the whole enjoyable, though that naturally depends on the how as much as the what.WNO’s Kiss Me, Kate is a revival of a co-production originally staged by Opera North and reviewed glowingly on these pages last year by Graham Rickson. It’s still a very good show, though I’m cooler about some aspects of it than Graham, probably because I’m cooler about the genre. For me the problem starts not with the music, which is brilliant if stereotyped, but with the book, the one aspect of the piece (apart from the stock orchestration) not by Porter, who wrote his own, very witty lyrics. In Jo Davies’s production the play is full-length and uncut (or so it feels), too long by half, not always all that decipherable, and often slow-moving, especially in the actual scenes from The Taming of the Shrew.Colin Richmond’s stunning soft-textured sets and costumes go a long way towards redeeming these scenes. But then his designs for the backstage sequences, though less pretty, are no less atmospheric, technically superb, and marvellously workable, with lightning quick changes and a sure sense of the intricate, multi-layered topography of a play about a play where the one constantly spills into the other. In addition, Davies manoeuvres her characters with immaculate timing and faultless coordination, no seams visible, everything – music, speech, movement – elided to perfection.And yet, and yet… When all is said and done, even this superior musical hangs more on the brilliance of individual numbers – like acts in a pantomime – than on anything you could call musical drama. Quirijn de Lang is vocally strong as Fred/Petruchio, no Broadway hack but a Mozart Almaviva and Guglielmo; and Jeni Bern, though patchy – or patchily miked – is a fine crossover soprano at her best as Lilli/Kate, likewise a sometime Mozartian, but also able to croon Broadway-style at need.Yet both are upstaged by singing-dancing minor characters, especially by Landi Oshinowo as Lilli’s assistant Hattie, who leads the evening off with gusto in “Another Op’nin’, Another Show”, then brings the house down alongside the dazzlingly athletic and musically spot-on Max Parker as Fred’s assistant Paul in “Too darn hot.” Amelia Adams-Pearce (pictured right) overacts irresistibly as the sexy blonde Lois/Bianca, then milks the show’s most famous number, “Always True to You in My Fashion”, to a point that almost justifies the double encore Porter presumably wrote in. Alan Burkitt does a snappy tap dance, if not a lot else, as Lois’s boyfriend, Bill. Finally there’s “Brush Up Your Shakespeare”, in the unlikely hands of the two gunmen who come to collect the gambling debt Fred hasn’t incurred, neatly done by Joseph Shovelton and John Savournin, again with interminable but after all enjoyable encores.This is more or less the Leeds cast, a fact that distances it somewhat from WNO, though the sparkling chorus (uncredited) and the superb orchestra are presumably “of the house”. Conductor James Holmes keeps everything moving and together with unobtrusive expertise. It’s good to see a top-notch musical benefitting from the world-class polish of a Welsh opera company. But it’s hardly Welsh opera.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/kiss-me-kate-welsh-national-opera,4
179,"Così fan tutte, Royal Opera",Così fan tutte,Royal Opera,2016-09-23,David Nice,"Prospects hadn't seemed that great for this new Covent Garden Così. Could Semyon Bychkov, powerful earth-and-fire conductor of Richard Strauss's darker operas, possibly find the right proportions of air and water in Mozart? Would German director Jan Philipp Gloger prove better than his Bayreuth reputation? As it happened, the sextet of half-unknown principals never sang less than respectably, and the production had some good ideas, though mostly linked to the look of expensive sets rather than to focused work on the psychology of confused lovers. It was Bychkov who nearly sank the evening.Even average Mozart conducting usually powers the drama well enough. When you hear an interpreter who really joins the dots and makes long acts seem like quarters of an hour, like Jonathan Cohen in Glyndebourne on Tour's Figaro and Mark Wigglesworth in ENO's revival of The Magic Flute, you understand how high the level can go. And when you hear someone like Bychkov sucking the human vitality out of Mozart's compassionate score, taking so many numbers slowly, in a style we thought had gone out with Klemperer and Colin Davis, and flaccidly, in a way that those two idiosyncratic masters never did, you realise how everything can fall at those kind of hurdles.Red lights flashed as soon as the Overture signposts the music which in the opera proper arch manipulator Don Alfonso uses to get his two protégés to repeat after him ""Co-sì-fan-tu-tte"" (""All women are like that""). If it were sung at such a speed we'd hardly make sense of it. It is also not good to have such pronounced drum-roll close to a mere prelude of an opening scene between the three men.Hardest pressed were the singers responsible for the two lovers who feel most deeply, and who really seem to be made for each other, Corinne Winters as Fiordiligi and Daniel Behle as Ferrando. Ferrando's lovely aria ""Un'aura amorosa"" is a sweet lovesong at a point in the action when nothing has yet gone deeper, so to take its Andante cantabile as Largo is to overegg the situation and force the singer to unnaturally elongated phrases, necessitating some very quiet singing; Behle pulled it off, but the number still didn't make musical or dramatic sense. The same went for Fiordiligi's more profound ""Per pietà"", etiolated to the point of torpor despite Winters’ ringing top notes and ornamentation (the chest range tends to come and go). No surprise, either, that their climactic duet (pictured above) went for little.Never really witty, Gloger's main contributions to the actual dynamics of the foursome who change partners and change back again - or do they? - are to make each Act Two duet in which the men in disguise test each other's fiancees for real. The girls seem to take on each other's men in their duet with two dummies (pictured up top). Dorabella realises it's Fiordiligi's man wooing her when she takes off his “Albanian” headgear, and in both cases discarded moustaches are the final seal of recognition.That begs more questions than it answers: would Dorabella so quickly betray her beloved sister with eyes wide open? And how to resolve the muddle in the Act Two finale when everyone actually knows the truth? The issue is fudged in a party scene, looking more like the Act 1 finale of Don Giovanni, where different sexual partners prove that ""all"" (tutti), not just women (tutte), “do it”. Better is the surprisingly light touch over who finally pairs off with whom (pictured above): at least Gloger avoids the fashionable unremitting bleakness so at odds with Mozart’s sparkling final ensemble.The mechanics are those of stagecraft, manipulated throughout by Don Alfonso (Johannes Martin Kränzle, never as remotely funny or encouraged to give as fully realised a character as his Glyndebourne Beckmesser). A curtain-call in 18th century costume during the Overture cues a steady removal of layers which take us somewhat surreally to a train station for the men's departure to ""war"" and a bar full of lounge lizards, loosely disguised Guglielmo and Ferrando included, who look as if they might launch into a Bob Fosse number but do nothing more interesting than fall like ninepins when prodded by a soubrettish Despina (Sabina Puértolas, hardly a departure from the usual stereotype).Ben Bauer's set designs, Karin Jud’s costumes and Bernd Purkrabek's lighting do a lovely job of an 18th century stage with bosky painted flats to launch the Act Two seductions (Alessio Arduini, Angela Brower and Winters pictured above), though the climactic duet on top of a hydraulic dressing-room scene isn’t easy to make out, at least from where I was sitting.All this is effective - and drips pound signs (or euros) - but the interpersonal dialogues, what Germans call the Personenregie, lose out to the bigger, looser picture. Too much of the action, especially the ensembles and the Act One finale for all its Garden of Eden novelty, plays out like your average stock, under-directed Così. Angel Brower's Dorabella and the Guglielmo of Alessio Arduini, a young baritone with a slightly worrying vibrato beyond his years that doesn’t blend well with the tenor, are sexy and youthful, but don't get the chance to project strong personalities.Bychkov again is partly to blame for not animating their lighter numbers, and there's a strong chance that the whole show, which the Royal Opera can't afford to jettison after a single run, would work a lot better under the baton, say, of Antonio Pappano, who has given us a superb Royal Opera Figaro from the keyboard. But while Bychkov, so admirable in different repertoire, drags, so will these performances. Interesting to see what difference Paul Wynne Griffiths, taking over on 19 October, might make. In the meantime, avoid if you can and wait for a revival.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/cos%C3%AC-fan-tutte-royal-opera,2
180,"La Canterina, Classical Opera, Page, Wigmore Hall",La Canterina,Classical Opera,2016-09-20,Helen Wallace,"Papa Haydn might have been tickled to see his early intermezzo, La Canterina, pack out the Wigmore Hall on a Monday night. A night for connoisseurs, then, but Classical Opera has form when it comes to refreshing classical repertoire with the elixir of vocal youth. And with a line-up boasting Susanna Hurrell, Rachel Kelly, Kitty Whately and Robert Murray, this was no exception.Each was neatly introduced through solo arias by Haydn’s Czech contemporary, Josef Mysliveček (b 1737). Prised from his opera Semiramide, with its bewilderingly convoluted backstory, they revealed a composer of considerable range, and made challenging show-pieces. Tenor Robert Murray took on a bravura outpouring, with hair-raising high cadenzas, just achieved, while Kitty Whately inhabited the torridly indignant part of Tamiri with impressive immediacy. There’s a bright, focused depth to Rachel Kelly’s mezzo - splendidly demonstrated in Classical Opera's superbly-cast performance earlier this season of Jommelli's Il Vologeso - which suggests boundless reserves, and she lent emotional weight to Semiramide’s charming pastorale. Soprano Susanna Hurrell (pictured below), replacing Ailish Tynan, breezed through Mirteo’s bucolic vision with agile ease. Mysliveček’s idiom is spacious and colourfully Italianate: little wonder Mozart admired him.This concert was part of Classical Opera’s Mozart 250, a characteristically intelligent project exploring the music scene in each year of the composer’s life, here 1766: Mozart was a ten-year-old travelling prodigy, Mysliveček wrote Semiramide, while Haydn had finally taken over as Kappellmeister for Prince Nicolaus Esterházy. Opening the evening was his Symphony No. 34 in D minor, whose grave, ‘churchy’ Adagio, felt as drear and indistinct as the mists over Esterházy’s Lake Neusiedl. Haydn once said that for his employer ‘nothing can ever be too long’: this was, and somewhat shapeless, even if Iain Page’s restraint was repaid in a vivaciously outdoorsy Allegro. The fleet, soft Presto could have been tighter.And so to La Canterina, or The Diva, a buffa tale of a scheming soubrette (Gasparina, played by Hurrell), her procuress or ""mother"" (Apollonia, Kelly), the singing teacher in whose house they’ve been lodging (Don Pellagio, a proto-Don Basilio, the adorable Robert Murray) and a young blood who fancies her (Don Ettore, Kitty Whately). Of course, the subject matter is irresistible: Haydn parodies every operatic trick in the book, and himself as composer. When Don Pellagio performs his new opera seria parody to Gasparina, he’s so bewitched by his own part-writing for horn and oboe he almost forgets its seductive import (mocked in testosterone-charged scales). An occasional ‘honking’ oboe adds to the knockabout.Murray (pictured left) relishes the part, apoplectic at chaperone Apollonia’s interjections (""Knit socks and keep out of it!""), torn between admiration and exasperation when his protegée uses his teaching against him. Hurrell sparkles as the insouciant material girl, milking her tragic aria while protesting ""I’ve lost my voice"". Only the smell of hard cash will rouse her from her faint.  As the brains behind the operation, Kelly brings sassy authority, kicking off proceedings with a paen to the wonders of make-up (it was originally a drag role). Only Whately’s part as Ettore seems underwritten, though she delivers it with clean aplomb. The second act exposes Haydn’s lack of instinct for dramatic pacing: Pellagio’s eviction of his tenants is positively languid, and even Steven Devine’s lively, articulate continuo cannot cover for prolix recitative. Instrumental tuning began to fray, but the singers held steady for a gloriously rich quartet finale in which the girls come out very much on top.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-canterina-classical-opera-page-wigmore-hall,4
181,"Norma, Royal Opera",Norma,Royal Opera,2016-09-13,alexandra Coghlan,"You wait ages for a Norma, and then three come along at once. English National Opera saw something nasty in the woodshed back in February with their 19th-century American take on Bellini, while up at the Edinburgh Festival this summer the opera’s original Romans and Druids traded togas for Tricolores and relocated to Nazi-occupied Paris. Now, bringing things right up to date, the Royal Opera give us a contemporary clerical fantasy of a production courtesy of La Fura dels Baus’s Àlex Ollé.The “fearful wood” of Felice Romani’s libretto remains, but is here transfigured by designer Alfons Flores from nature’s doing into something terribly and horribly man-made. Framing the stage’s church interiors are a series of tree-like pillars, each fashioned (it gradually becomes evident in Marco Filibeck’s half-light) from hundreds of jutting wooden crucifixes. The effect is grotesque, uncanny, like ossuary art made from skulls and bones. Here the skeleton of Christianity itself is taken to pieces, its symbolism fractured and rendered meaningless through insistent, clamouring repetition. As the evening progresses these crucifixes only multiply, crowding in on the characters from all sides – even above, in a bizarre fusion of a Baldacchino and an oversized crown of thorns. Christianity here is swollen and bloated Alice In Wonderland style – even the thurible is gigantic, the incense-spewing twin of Santiago’s Botafumeiro.Into this giant temple to superstition comes a cast all enslaved to its service. Uniforms range from cassocks and robes to the white cloaks, masks and pointed capirotes of Easter Week. Even the children, masked as well, are already in thrall to this all-powerful religion that has replaced neutral community space and interactions with its own all-consuming agenda. Bizarrely in this quasi-Catholic setup women are permitted to be priests (how else was Ollé to make sense of Norma’s status?), a gesture that rings hollow in so militarised and orthodox a society.The sole escape from this confining church interior is the opening to Act II. Suddenly we find ourselves in a modern playroom. Cartoons play on the television, toys are strewn on the floor while Norma’s two children, bright in their pyjamas, cuddle up on the sofa. Into this familiar domestic space comes Norma herself (Sonya Yoncheva, pictured above), knife in hand. Laying out a child on plastic sheeting she prepares for murder. It’s manipulative, calculated stuff, but has the desired effect. The live-by-the-sword extremity of orthodox religion has no place in domestic life as we know it, Ollé makes emphatically clear. Norma and her colleagues might sport the most modern of clerical trousersuits, but their religion is still a blunt, medieval instrument.Most of the talk leading up to this production has centred on the role of Norma – abandoned by Anna Netrebko in April on the grounds that her voice has evolved away from the role. Stepping up for her own role debut was Bulgarian soprano Sonya Yoncheva – a choice last night’s premiere gave Pappano and the Royal Opera little cause to regret. Hers is still a Norma in progress. There’s power, stamina and above all star quality here, but also currently a lack of control. “Casta Diva” came on and off the breath, as did much of Act I, and top notes sometimes felt snatched, the extremes of register not full joined up with the main body of the voice. But, both musically and dramatically, this is going to be a superb role for her – something we saw increasingly sustained proof of in Act II, where vocal colour and emotional urgency finally came together.Joseph Calleja’s Pollione (pictured above right) – also a role debut – had a more mixed night. Strained and uneven in Act I, finding space at the bottom of the voice that he simply couldn’t carry up to the top, things did improve towards the end, but it remains to be seen whether this caddish Roman proconsul really is a good role for him. Mezzo Sonia Ganassi struggled as Adalgisa, unfocused in tone and finding little of the character’s innocent beauty, written so clearly into Bellini’s delicate vocal lines, while Brindley Sherratt (Oroveso) seemed to be having an uncharacteristically poor night, struggling badly at the opening, though recovering to deliver a strong finale together with a very unexpected plot twist. Pappano’s orchestra deliver a crisp and not over-sentimental account of the score, though with two principals new to their roles one wonders how many tempi were not of his choosing.This is a show that will polarise audiences. Some will struggle with the baby-and-bathwater directorial relocation, making a nonsense of the libretto, others will adore the spectacle and spirit Ollé brings to this difficult piece. It’s often hard to find the real woman in Norma, the priestess-mother, the would-be murderer of her children, but between them Yoncheva and Ollé do bring both her and her oppressive, orthodox world into focus. Let’s hope this Norma gets a revival, because my instinct is that this ambitious, sometimes unwieldy, production will only improve.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/norma-royal-opera,3
182,"Owen Wingrave, British Youth Opera, Peacock Theatre",Owen Wingrave,British Youth Opera,2016-09-07,alexandra Coghlan,"Owen Wingrave is the Britten opera that always comes with a caveat, an apology. Dramatically flawed (a problem partially, but by no means entirely, accounted for by its genesis as a television opera) and musically uneven, it has nevertheless emerged recently as a favourite choice for young singers, with Guildhall (2013), the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland (2016) and now British Youth Opera (2016) all choosing to stage it, with varying degrees of success.Owen, last of the soldiering clan of the Wingraves, leaves officer training, casting his family’s history aside in favour of an avowed pacifism. Forced to return to the family estate of Paramore, he confronts the displeasure and disgust of his relations and fiancée Kate. Taunting his masculinity she dares him to spend a night in the house’s haunted room, but when she returns to unlock the door finds him dead.This latest production by Max Webster for BYO is visually very attractive, offering a sequence of striking stage pictures that somehow never quite coalesce into a drama. That oddly inert quality inherent to a score that flirts with 12-tone techniques is left largely unchallenged, despite some attempts to reverse the traditional order of seen and unseen elements. Webster does away with the family portraits that provide a focal point for the music, but unaccountably decides to open up the locked room in which young pacifist Owen meets his violent fate. Henry James, master of mystery, knew that discretion was the better part of horror, and the imagined fate of his hero is far more potent than this more literal approach.James Cotterill’s handsome designs situate the opera between James’s original era and Britten’s, colliding CND banners and a contemporary war memorial (a poignant backcloth to all the action) with Edwardian costumes. The Southend Boys’ Choir roam the stage with toy guns, holding up makeshift signs reminding us of the casualties of conflicts from Vietnam to the Boer War. Paramore itself is little more than a suggestion of furniture, but suspended above the heads of its inhabitants is a cloud of machine guns – a symbol more beautiful than subtle.Despite its name, British Youth Opera is a finishing school for young professional singers, usually already working at postgraduate level or beyond. Their casts are reliably strong, and this was no exception. Providing a vocal and emotional anchor for this coldest of works were Harry Thatcher’s Spencer Coyle and Alexandra Lowe’s Mrs Coyle, both demonstrating real vocal control and no little beauty without ever losing the clarity of diction essential in a production without surtitles.Superb mezzo Katie Coventry (impressive earlier this year in the title role of the London Handel Festival’s Ariodante) makes sense of Kate Julian’s brittle outbursts and volatile temper, loading the line, “Why was I not born a man?” with real desperation. Vocally outweighing Dominic Sedgwick’s Owen (pictured left), who consistently prioritises beauty of tone over power, her strength is however met with effective softness and stillness. Resisting the urge to do too much, Sedgwick offers a sensitive portrait of a young man troubled by conscience. Mention should also be made of tenor James Liu, who sings the ballad of the Wingraves with tremendous tenderness and a lovely sense of line.Myfanwy Piper’s libretto remains stubbornly unmusical, and the odd acoustic of the Peacock Theatre means that Alex Ingram’s Southbank Sinfonia risk overpowering the singers at times, but a strong cast and stylish production go some way towards rehabilitating this troubled piece.@alexacoghlan",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/owen-wingrave-british-youth-opera-peacock-theatre,3
183,"Prom 68: Semiramide, OAE, Elder",Prom 68: Semiramide,OAE,2016-09-05,alexandra Coghlan,"Between the Berlin Philharmonic, Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra and Simón Bolivar Symphony Orchestra it has been a big week at the Proms, in every sense. Scope and scale have been the watchwords for the orchestral tectonics that have taken place, the sonic landscapes that have been formed and reformed. But concert-goers on Sunday night were hit with an operatic aftershock of overwhelming force, bringing this penultimate Proms week to a close next weekend’s patriotic spectacular will struggle to match.Rarely staged in the UK, Rossini’s Semiramide, like Verdi’s Il Trovatore, is an opera you only put on if you have the singers. The demanding central roles have been synonymous over the years with the likes of Joan Sutherland and Marilyn Horne, and it takes a bold company to take those memories on. Step forward record label Opera Rara, who might just have done it again, taking a neglected 19th-century opera and restoring it lovingly to new colour and life. The recording won’t be out till next year, but if this sneak preview performance is anything to go by it’s going to be another winner.The cast has been something of a moveable feast over past weeks, with various singers (notably bass-baritone Ildebrando D’Arcangelo) pulling out, but the final line-up – led by soprano Albina Shagimuratova as Semiramide, mezzo Daniela Barcellona as Arsace and young bass Mirco Palazzi as Assur – was an outstanding one.Based on Voltaire’s play Semiramis, the plot is at the extreme end even of bel canto excess. Semiramide rules Assyria, but only because she and her erstwhile lover Assur have murdered her husband Nino and seemingly also her son. Forced to name an heir, Semiramide chooses the warrior Arsace, claiming him as her husband. Unfortunately not only does Arsace love the princess Azema instead, but is also Semiramide’s lost son, as priestly advisor Idreno reveals. A climactic encounter between the wicked Assur and noble Arsace ensues, but it’s Semiramide who ends up dead, accidentally killed by her own son.Conductor Mark Elder (pictured right) makes a strong case in his programme notes for performing this work to length, surrendering to the inherent structural scope of an opera that runs to well over four and a half hours without cuts. Even here, however, some trims were necessary, with Barry Banks’s Idreno and Susana Gaspar’s Azema the big losers. The effect was to throw the focus all the more unremittingly on the central trio, whose lives are so devastatingly intertwined in a scheming triangle that has more than an echo of the Macbeths’s relationship about it. Strip away staging too, and the dramatic intensity was stifling, a rare opportunity to see what Rossini’s music can achieve without directorial intervention.In Shagimuratova (pictured left) bel canto has a potential new queen. The soprano’s first outing in the genre displayed all the necessary tools for success. An easy power, coupled with striking agility, set the hall ringing, whether at pianissimo (for her glorious reconciliation with Arsace) or fortissimo, and her trill is beyond reproach. Extensive embellishment allowed her to reimagine this low-lying role as something altogether more suited to her soprano strengths, providing a gilded foil to Barcellona’s deliciously dusky mezzo. Unaffected in her delivery, even throughout her impressive range, Barcellona really is the business. Especially impressive is her work at the very bottom of the register, finding tone and warmth even in the awkward “Ah” Quel giorno ognor”.If Mirco Palazzi’s light Assur couldn’t quite banish thoughts of D’Arcangelo, then this young bass nevertheless put it a creditable showing, rallying his audibly depleted forces for a vivid mad scene. But more exciting (and much more powerful) was Gianluca Buratto’s sonorous Oroe, a distinctive vocal presence that promises much for the future. Served well by the lighter, clearer textures of the period Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, Barry Banks’ Idreno carried beautifully through the hall, his music shaped with a striking range of colours, and his one surviving aria – “La speranza piu soave” – was a love-song of tremendous poignancy.Elder’s brisk tempi and contributions from both a swollen OAE and the tight Opera Rara Chorus kept the drama moving, making a strong case for this bel canto behemoth. If it translates even half as well on disc this will be still be a performance well worth buying.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/prom-68-semiramide-oae-elder,4
184,"Prom 45: The Makropulos Affair, BBCSO, Bělohlávek",Prom 45: The Makropulos Affair,BBCSO,2016-08-20,David Nice,"Karel Čapek, the great Czech writer who pioneered some of the most prophetic dramatic fantasies of the early 20th century, thought Janáček was nuts to want to set his wordy play about a 337-year-old woman to music. He could not have anticipated what that septuagenarian genius would achieve. Some of us felt similarly doubtful about singers performing this most conversational of operas with scores and music stands in a ""concert staging"". But the Albert Hall can be as surprising and as unpredictable as Janáček, and it helped a dream cast, conductor and orchestra to produce vintage Proms magic.This, in short, was the most electrifying Proms opera since Nina Stemme and Donald Runnicles pulled it off in Strauss’s Salome, and so many things that the concert Jenůfa at the Festival Hall in April, for all its sonic beauties, was not. Karita Mattila (pictured below in Act One), glued to the score on that occasion in preparation for a role she had yet to sing on stage, knows the part of the 1920s diva Emilia Marty, born Elina Makropulos in 1585, inside out. With her ageless beauty and that unique incandescent sound, Mattila can embody the strangeness of a woman whose soul has died within her and yet who still longs for release.Physically, the gestures are writ perhaps larger, in the first act at least, than they would be in the realistic production setting of a lawyer's office, but how clearly she made her reactions felt for those in the audience who hadn't bought a programme, didn't know the opera and had to do without supertitles (still a great drawback of the Proms – surely they could fill the hall with enough screens to make it work?) The comedy got the laughs on cue, not least when Marty declares that a long-dead rival diva ""squeaked"" (""Strada piskala""). Had she been studying flamenco arm movements for the intermezzo with the decayed suitor who recognises in her the gypsy ""Eugenia Montez"" of a previous existence?As for the great final scene (pictured below), where the diva tells the assembled company how lucky they are to have a natural life span where everything still has meaning, Mattila kept it simple, allowing the voice to pour forth an emotional stream of Janáček's unique bel canto. Plenty before this was beautiful to listen to; the role may have had great singing-actresses to thrill on stage, above all the inimitable Anja Silja at Glyndebourne, but it has surely never sounded so lovely as well as expressive.The same could be said for a BBC Symphony Orchestra on simply amazing form under Jiří Bělohlávek, who knows the Janáček scores probably better than any other living conductor. If his Jenůfa with the Czech Philharmonic projected warmth but not bite, the typical sound of a Bohemian ensemble rather than one from Janáček's native Moravia, this – like the playing of the ENO Orchestra under Mark Wigglesworth in a near-perfect Jenůfa – captured both, and specifically the fire and ice of a more singularly orchestrated score, projecting into the hall the inspired ideas, enough for 10 operas, which drive the music forwards for a minute or two each and then are gone.Seconds into the longest of the composer's operatic preludes, pittting passion against the fanfares of the past – as in Wagner's Lohengrin, the composer doesn’t reveal what the other-worldly music means until the Act Three denouement – we were hearing unbelievable sounds from piccolo and first horn, ostinato figures usually smothered by the strings. The clarinet family, too, worked wonders of warming colour, and Bělohlávek's pacing was a miracle – letting sympathy surface through the legal wranglings early in the action through a held chord, a dramatic silence, working the spaces of a hall he knows well not just as a conductor but also as an Arena Prommer.All the singers delivering idiomatic Czech were simply perfect, as the supporting cast had been in the concert Jenůfa. Four tenors, older and younger, reminded us how Janáček's homeland still produces a special type of high voice type. Aleš Briscein (pictured below) as Albert Gregor went for the top notes fearlessly and conveyed all the bewilderment of the non-love scenes with the woman who turns out to be his grandmother (or great-great-great-great-grandmother, as Marty later claims). It sounds as if Aleš Voráček, as the hapless Janek bewitched by Marty and bullied by his nasty father Baron Prus (Svatopluk Sem, as vivid in dark-hued projection as Gustáv Beláček's lawyer Kolenatý), also has a future in major roles. Eva Štěrbová as Janek's girlfriend Krista, the young singer infatuated with the diva's example, characterised beautifully – spirited and debutantish like The Sound of Music's Liesl in Act One, conveying numb misery and then acceptance simply by her body language towards the end as Marty's fate becomes clear.Never underestimate the role of a director in a concert performance like this. Kenneth Richardson and his (uncredited) design team did a fine job. Costumes were right, as the evening dress had palpably not been in the Festival Hall Jenůfa, and for once the back display, which reached an apogee of hideousness at the start of Wednesday night's Prom with mint-green toothpaste swirls against black for Barenboim and the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, had meaningful and well formed images. I liked the brief appearances of the telephone, the old portrait of Mattila when the question of a signed photograph arises, the booze for Marty's drunken revelations (just a pity that this last detail didn't yield to a portrait of Rudolf II when Marty narrates the history of the life elixir).We also got green, as the stage directions indicate, at the start of the most exultant of operatic endgames, yielding to a magnesium flare as the elixir's prescription finally goes up in flames.This of all Proms should have been televised; we could have watched it again and again with subtitles to boot. As it is, the visuals, above all Mattila's diverse poses, will live on in the minds of those who saw them, while the astonishing sounds can continue to resonate, for a while at least, on iPlayer.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/prom-45-makropulos-affair-bbcso-belohlavek,5
185,"A Midsummer Night's Dream, Glyndebourne",A Midsummer Night's Dream,Glyndebourne,2016-08-12,alexandra Coghlan,"Britten’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream is too other-worldly to have anything as mortal as a musical heartbeat. Pulsing through it instead are musical quivers, jolts of eerie energy first heard in the opening cello glissandi. Denaturing the instrument, transforming it from a voice so nearly human to one of harmonic and textural androgyny, Britten cuts away the safety cables of Shakespeare’s framing court scenes, plunging his young lovers straight into the fairy forest where anything is possible and nothing is as it seems. As a theatrical sleight of hand it’s almost impossible to match, but Peter Hall’s production comes very, very close.Which is why, of course, 35 years after its original staging and a decade since it was last seen at Glyndebourne, Hall’s production is back for its ninth revival – the only possible way the festival could mark 2016’s Shakespeare anniversary. A lot has changed since 1981, but no CGI in the world could match the homespun illusion Hall and designer John Bury conjure here.Revealing itself only gradually on the barely-lit stage, the forest ripples with hidden life – the visual echo of Britten’s keening cellos. Trees sway and shift, bushes creep, and only very gradually as eyes begin to focus we realise that among them are people, part of the physical fabric of the forest. It’s beautifully managed, delicately lit by Paul Pyant, and as magical an opening as this opera has ever had.But, crucially, Hall’s is a rough magic too. The Arthur Rackham-inspired designs, inflected with Elizabethan courtliness, might anchor Oberon and Tytania in a fairytale world, but these are the fairytales of Grimm or Angela Carter, where violence, sexual power and manipulation throw happily ever after off balance. Oberon (Tim Mead) seizes this child-Puck (David Evans) bodily, flinging him to the floor in anger, and broods over his sleeping Tytania (Kathleen Kim, pictured above) with eyes less lustful than sadistic.Some starry casts have inhabited this production over the years, and this revival is no exception. Mead sounds better than ever – a chilly Oberon whose “I know a bank” rings metallic-pure, only swelling into the faintest flutter of vibrato for the final note of a phrase, a sensualist’s practised caress. Stretched into implausible height by his wig, he looms over Kim, who appears almost as another child in this court of fairies rather than his wife and queen.Both Kim, however, and Kate Royal (returning to the role of Helena 10 years after she first sang it in this production) feel miscast vocally. Kim may still have all the high notes, but she works harder for them now. In her efficient performance we lack that mysterious ease, even at the extremes of the register, that this fairy queen needs to set her apart from all about her. “Music, ho!” is the cry of the wind or running water, direct, unadorned, not a man-made product, however beautifully crafted. Royal too, though singing strongly, feels too mature now for the role of this gangling teenage girl. Her increasingly wide vibrato, so right for Glyndebourne’s Marschallin in 2014, here feels out of place, unbalancing the quartet “And I have found Demetrius like a jewel”. The other lovers fare better – Duncan Rock an impetuous Demetrius, polished into manhood by singing of tremendous evenness and gloss, Benjamin Hulett a lyrical and impassioned Lysander. But it’s Elizabeth DeShong’s Hermia who seizes the ear again and again with her thickly-spread mezzo. (Pictured above: Rock, Hulett, Royal and DeShong).Matthew Rose returns as Bottom – a loveable thunderer and blusterer rather than a complete buffoon in his handling – leading a troupe of fine mechanicals (pictured above) including Colin Judson (Snout), David Soar (a powerful Peter Quince) and Anthony Gregory (Flute). Their comedy is handled with care, deliberately held back from hilarity until the anarchic climax of the play. Would a little more humour undermine the carefully crafted tensions of the fairy episodes? I’m not sure it would, and with a summer audience hungry for laughter as well as beauty it seems a shame not to give it to them. That said, Gregory in particular has a riot as the luckless Thisby, and the easy chemistry of the group is a delight.Jakub Hrůša conducts a neat, carefully shaded performance from the LPO, making much of Britten’s generous string writing, and the boys of Trinity Boys’ Choir somehow manage to act, dance and sing Britten’s tricky melodies with complete assurance and ease. But at the centre of this gorgeous theatrical and musical illusion is David Evans’s Puck. Beautifully spoken, a beacon of red hair and irrepressible energy among so much courtly darkness, his is the tale we follow most urgently, the child-man whose fate and future in Hall’s gorgeous forests of the night is horribly uncertain.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/midsummer-nights-dream-glyndebourne,4
186,"The Exterminating Angel, Die Liebe der Danae, Salzburg Festival",The Exterminating Angel,Die Liebe der Danae,2016-08-03,David Nice,"""Because the world has outlived its own downfall, it nevertheless needs art."" Paul Celan's words stand alongside Anselm Kiefer's Jacob's Dream, part of a stunning Surrealism-centric exhibition in the foyer of Salzburg's second and more amenable festival venue, the Haus für Mozart. What a meaningful motto it turned out to be for both of this year's major festival offerings, good and bad.That downfall must have seemed final to the 80-year-old Richard Strauss as bombing curtailed the world premiere of his penultimate opera, Die Liebe der Danae, in 1944. Yet this far from shallow ""cheerful mythology"" returned to Salzburg for its coronation in 1952, then in 2002, and now in an expensive charade by design-obsessed Alvis Hermanis. The festival audience, surely more showy and predominantly less cultured than in Strauss's time but otherwise presumably not much altered, seemed to lap it up. Thank heaven or hell, then, for this year's premiere, a production of Thomas Adès's The Exterminating Angel (****) which actually had something to say about the hermetic world of the Salzburg Festival today.Luis Buñuel's subversive 1962 film and Adès's opera, long in the making, hold up a mirror to this kind of well-heeled milieu and smash it. The bourgeoisie and aristocrats under examination are a group of elegant ladies and gentlemen unable to leave after a strange dinner party, even though the door to the outside world remains open. The subterranean stream of consciousness which Buñuel achieved solely through images and derailing dinner-party dialogue seems to cry out for music, and Adès - orchestrally, at least - has responded brilliantly to the phantasmagoria.His response is typically eclectic, avoiding one dominant sound-world for this dream-play in favour of dramatic lurches and characteristic pastiches distorting music familiar - Strauss waltzes and a grinding climax based on Bach's ""Sheep may safely graze"" - as well as more arcane, homages to the Spanish context in dance-numbers and to outsider figures in the Hebrew poetry which director-librettist Tom Cairns has incorporated into a much-adapted treatment of the screenplay. There is depth to the sound, the favouring of low, grumbling instruments, but not, I think, on a first hearing - and I should willingly undergo a second and third - to the substance. As conducted by the composer, it sounds like the overheated, dense polar opposite to the chill refinement of George Benjamin's Written on Skin. Adès's work is closer to masterpiece status, if not quite there, and a good deal more entertaining.That has to be in large measure due to a superlative cast working within Hildegard Bechtler's stupendous sets and costumes - again, a mirror to Salzburg if not necessarily to the varied audience which received the work so ecstatically in the more human of the festival venues. Adès and Cairns have reduced Buñuel's main dramatis personae of Big Brother House participants from 19 to a mere 15, which with bit parts for the servants and outsiders makes this an expensive number to maintain in the repertoire.Act One is a confusion of ensembles - the greater precision of a Richard Jones as director would have pinpointed who's who more deftly, and probably been funnier - but eventually Adès gives ariettas and duets to personalities he wants to highlight. Making the most memorable impression are one of our greatest mezzos, Christine Rice, as the pianist Blanca Delgado, who sings a setting of Chaim Bialik's ""Over the Sea""; countertenor Iestyn Davies as the neurotic, sibling-obsessed aristocrat Francisco de Ávila with his little number - quoting or pastiching what? - about inappropriate teaspoons for coffee; and Anne Sofie von Otter, back on top form after some dubious excursions, as a dying woman who gets a mad scene straitjacketed by guitar accompaniment (pictured above with John Tomlinson, Christine Rice and Frédéric Antoun).If there's a main character, it might be the diva and ""virgin savage Walküre"" Leticia Maynar. Since she's supposed to have just performed Lucia di Lammermoor, Ades gives Audrey Luna (pictured below standing with glass; also featured - Amanda Echalaz, Iestyn Davies and Sally Matthews) more of the insane stratospheric writing of Ariel in The Tempest - Luna sang the role at the Met - and lets her lead the final Chaconne to a tentative freedom. There is haunting music for the love-death infatuation of the betrothed couple Beatriz (Sophie Bevan) and Edmondo (Ed Lyon). But everyone else makes a mark. Impossible to credit them all, but let’s settle for Sally Matthews as the overloved sister, Amanda Echalaz as the flamboyant if word-cloudy hostess, John Tomlinson's overbearing Doctor and Thomas Allen making the most of his few lines as conductor Alberto Roc.Such personalities help to paper over the chief drawback of Adès's operatic work: the often square, ungainly vocal writing. The awkwardness doesn't seem to be as pointed as Gerald Barry's much sparer and more differentiated stylisations, and the sopranos come off worst. When he's not pastiching, Adès doesn't quite hit the heights he aims for, least of all in the big final climax, though the orchestra interlude before it - the Bach distortion as the sheep the hostess had ordered for an unrealised diversion reappear for slaughter - duly stuns. Summoned by bells, ritual repetitions bind it all together, and the odd sound of the ondes martenot (Cynthia Millar, another welcome star ""vocalist"") suggest the invisible angel of the alluring title; but the musical screw doesn’t turn as inexorably as it might.Still, it's all never less than gripping. What a relief the Salzburg management decided against the original idea of putting it on in the impossible Festspielhaus, that great barn with its wide stage. A saving grace of Hermanis's attempt to present Die Liebe der Danae (**) is his thrusting of all the action forward in front of a tiled wall. But there is no attempt at getting the singers to interact meaningfully, to bring out what's surely there in Strauss's late, often playful homage to the main theme of Wagner's Ring - true love versus power in the shape of gold.How that might have resounded in a Bechtler-style reflection of the audience. Instead principals and chorus become flailing mannequins - in costumes opulently designed by Juozas Statkevičius - for a slightly dodgy recreation of Bakst/Diaghilev-style orientalism (pictured above:Jupiter disguised as Midas arrived on a white elephant), with chadored women in the last act mirroring heroine Danae's choice of a simple life in a way that verges on the insulting. It's as if Edward Said never wrote his study on Orientalism. There was never any point, anyway, in searching for depth. Not long in to the tedium of the first-act staging, bells began to ring: several years back, John Tomlinson made an on-the-record protest about a director who told the singers he didn't want them in a Salzburg staging of Birtwistle's Gawain, compelling him to block the action from memories of the Royal Opera production. That was Hermanis. And they asked him back?Pity the principals, waving their arms ineffectually. Wince at the insistent movement by telly-spectacular choreographer Alla Sigalova for what looks like a group of schoolgirls whose teacher has asked if they can participate. And feel very sorry, if you know and love the score as I do, that there's no hint of the pathos in Jupiter's final meeting with his ""last love"" (Jupiters Letzte Liebe would have been a better title, one Strauss considered as he came to equate the god's farewell to earth with his own). If only the image pictured left could have been brought into focus and not overwhelmed by peripheral business..Tomasz Konieczny is not quite right for Jupiter. He’s a robust bass-baritone in his prime, not a Hotter or a Norman Bailey close to the end of their careers. It's an insane sing, though, and very high at times; Koniecny only falls at the final hurdle. There's no competition from the man Danae really loves, Midas of the golden touch. I'd thought of Gerhard Siegel exclusively as character tenor. He turns out to have the stamina for Midas but not the vocal or physical glamour. Maybe the tenor singing the small role of Mercury, Norbert Ernst, might have made a better job; but then the demands are huge, and Siegel meets them.Best is the glorious Krassimira Stoyanova (pictured below with dancers) as a lovely heroine. I knew her as a gracious and giving performer, but not that one in a thousand, the true Strauss lyric-dramatic soprano who can soar and swoop, working miracles on phrases that never stop coming. How she negotiated the highest of them all, late in the final scene, would be worth the high cost of admission alone.Franz Welser-Möst, never an ideal Strauss conductor, can't match Stoyanova's generosity. He rushes too much of the music, above all the profundity of the great Act Three interlude, Four Last Songs territory: didn't he notice something wrong when the gruppetti or turns couldn't be articulated at that speed? The best that can be said is that the Vienna Philharmonic sound is right for this most sophisticated of scores and that Welser-Möst achieves an elegance in the lighter passages.Most of these belong to the delectable quartet of Jupiter's discarded loves and the stories they bring with them, musically illustrated with diverting gorgeousness. The four ladies work well together, but the standouts are Maria Celeng as high-line Semele - an ideal Strauss light lyric soprano, as Regine Hangler's maid Xanthe is certainly not - and Jennifer Johnston, crystal-clear of diction and with all the stonking low notes Leda needs. She seemed to be having fun, but would have had more in David Fielding's super-inventive Garsington production, where the queens and their consorts were ballroom dancers.Danae awaits a home-grown production at the Royal Opera. You can see why it doesn't get done often; to work at the highest level it needs the luxury musical resources - and presumably the rehearsal time - Salzburg wields. Yet if Covent Garden can host the difficulties of Adès, as it’s due to do next spring, it has an equal duty to serve the rarer, most sophisticated Strauss. Come on, Royal Opera, it's high time. But please, choose your director with care.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/exterminating-angel-die-liebe-der-danae-salzburg-festival,
187,"The Yeomen of the Guard, National Gilbert & Sullivan Opera Company",The Yeomen of the Guard,National Gilbert & Sullivan Opera Company,2016-08-02,Richard Bratby,"By the end of Act One of The Yeomen of the Guard there's been a jailbreak, a clandestine marriage, a swapped identity and a cancelled beheading. The chorus sings, halberds are brandished, and a jester jests. Even by Gilbert and Sullivan standards, it’s one heck of a tangle. And then, in John Savournin’s touring production, the stage clears and, true to Gilbert’s directions, Elsie faints in Fairfax’s arms while silhouetted behind them, masked and motionless, stands the grim figure of the executioner. At which point you start to realise that the only way Gilbert’s going to be able to solve his own dramatic puzzle is by taking one of his own cheerful, colourfully drawn characters - and destroying them.The Yeomen of the Guard is the problem play of the Savoy Operas: the one that opera snobs carefully avoid mentioning when dismissing G&S in a flurry of unexamined prejudices and throwaway references to topsy-turvydom. With its Tudor setting and majestic overture, it’s occasionally been called the “English Meistersinger"", which even a hardcore Savoyard would probably concede is going a bit far. Undeniably, though, it’s aiming for the same tragicomic kick in the stomach you might get from, say, Twelfth Night, and it’s a tribute to its creators that, however literal the production, it simply can’t be played as straight comedy. The death-haunted logic of the plot, the flashes of self-knowledge that illuminate Gilbert’s libretto and the aching poignancy of one of Sullivan’s most consistently inspired scores all prevent that.As director, Savournin gets it. Which is why, in this production, he can get away with presenting something that looks at first sight like the hoariest load of old-school G&S clichés. The Yeomen wear picture postcard uniforms, the women have spotlessly laundered period frocks, and there’s a flat, painted set that looks like something left over from a village hall panto. The principal characters, too, seem at first to be playing it straight and not particularly deep, with a mixture of light and more conventionally operatic voices. Fiona Mackay’s Phoebe is a perky soubrette with Martin Lamb bluff and amiable as her father Sergeant Meryll. Nicholas Sales sings Colonel Fairfax with leading-man charm and an elegant tenor, and Bruce Graham (pictured below, with Richard Gauntlett) lurches and gurns cheerfully as the jailer Shadbolt (he's got some wonderfully sepulchral low notes too). It’s all a set-up, though, for the entrance of Richard Gauntlett as the jester Jack Point and Jane Harrington as his beloved Elsie: and when they’re on stage, it’s hard to look at anyone else.Gauntlett’s physical grace and verbal dexterity make him a natural comedian. As the crowd jostles him, we see fear erase his smile, and then watch him spring back, eyes pleading: a man for whom humour really is a defence. Harrington’s rich, tightly focussed soprano soars over the big choral scenes. Rarely smiling, she becomes the focus of the unfolding emotional tragedy as Gilbert flips operetta convention on its head and turns the comic pair into the leading players, making the grand passions and life-or-death schemes of the loftier characters feel like the trivial diversion. “It is easier to die well than to live well,” comments Colonel Fairfax in Act One; in Sales’s caddish portrayal he spends much of Act Two (having cheated death) seemingly proving that point. Gauntlett’s patter songs, meanwhile, are in the Richard Suart class, and his scenes with Graham were both witty in themselves, and a fascinating study in the nature of comedy. There’s something touching and intensely troubling about Gauntlett’s portrayal: of a piece with Gilbert’s whole, Petrushka-like notion of taking a stock comic character and giving them a human heart. His final collapse was wrenching.Musical values are high, on stage at least: Pauline Birchall brings dignity and a velvet-and-steel voice to Dame Carruthers (one of Gilbert’s less cruel mezzo roles), the choral singing is crisp and powerful, and David Steadman, conducting a decent-sized orchestra, keeps the pace brisk while letting Sullivan’s lyricism breathe. Scrappy orchestral entries were compensated for by characterful woodwind playing and some extremely fine ensemble singing from the principals; the Act Two quartet Strange Adventure was a moment of radiant stillness.In other words, there’s a complex and moving opera here (Gilbert and Sullivan never considered it an operetta); there’s also an entertaining, very traditional-looking and clearly low-budget touring G&S production. No doubt there are many who won’t be able to see past that – just as for many audience members, that in itself would be enjoyable enough. It came across handsomely in the mini-Coliseum that is Buxton Opera House, and will doubtless do so elsewhere too. The truth is that it really shouldn’t be left to a privately-funded touring company, operating under severe financial constraints, to stage this repertoire. If it had been composed in a country with a less philistine operatic culture, The Yeomen of the Guard would be a staple of the national companies (one or two of our own could do a lot worse than look at it again). For now, though, Savournin and the National Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company present it with commitment, insight and considerable style. They deserve to succeed.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/yeomen-guard-national-gilbert-sullivan-opera-company,3
188,"Kommilitonen, Welsh National Youth Opera, Barry",Kommilitonen,Welsh National Youth Opera,2016-07-29,stephen Walsh,"What happened was this. I found my way, not without difficulty, to the Barry Memo Arts Centre, got my ticket, had a chat with the librettist, stopped to order an interval drink, then turned round to discover that the entire audience had disappeared, as if eliminated by a Star Wars de-atomiser, or whatever those things are called. Two or three of us ran outside, looked this way and that, and after a few panic-stricken minutes tracked down the audience, who had gone right round the building in a crocodile and re-entered it by a door on the far side.Yes, you’ve guessed it. It was a “promenade” performance, one of those shows where the audience stands around, moves this way and that, does what it’s told, and tries in vain to understand what the hell is actually going on. The irony is that Peter Maxwell Davies's student opera Kommilitonen, which was being performed by the wonderful WNO Youth Opera, is all about freedom: about people who don’t do what they’re told by corrupt regimes (which, it’s true, WNO is possibly not).Originally a commission from the Royal Academy of Music, Kommilitonen is, as its librettist David Pountney puts it, “not only for students but about students”. Its subject is student activism, for better or worse. It combines three very different episodes from 20th-century history: the anti-Hitler leaflet campaign of the White Rose student group in Munich in 1942, the story of James Meredith (Oscar Castellino, pictured below), the first black graduate in the US Civil Rights movement of the early Sixties, and – on the dark side – the activities of students in the Chinese Cultural Revolution under Mao. And into this medley it slots a brief cameo from Dostoyevsky's Karamazov, the Grand Inquisitor on the doubtful virtues of freedom.As an idea, it was curiously old-fashioned at the time it was conceived, 2010, and it still reeks to some extent of the Sixties and Seventies, when progressive opera, like student protest itself, meant more or less mindless demonstrating about this or that, articulated through a lot of noise, rushing around and waving of banners. Its dramaturgical essence is confusion. What with the montage of events, the switching of attention from place to place, and the overload of documentary materials – the posters, the graffiti, the pronunciamentos, not to mention the surtitles – the experience is, and is presumably meant to be, fundamentally incoherent. At its worst it treats its audience like cattle, shunting them hither and yon, engaging them physically as much as mentally. If this is freedom, one might think, give me solitude.Having got all that off my chest, I have to admit that this production, by Polly Graham, is a dazzlingly impressive affair in its own right, not least because Maxwell Davies’s score is one of his most beautiful and skilfully designed. In some respects it harks back to his own Sixties manner: it has a honky-tonk piano, vulgar marches, popular tunes of one kind or another, integrated into a dark atonal idiom which seems to plumb those depths of individual feeling that are the hidden meaning of all public events. But all this goes with a mature mastery of the good old-fashioned techniques of harmony and counterpoint, and an aural certainty that sometimes went by the board amid the violent contrasts and conflicts of his early music theatre.The production itself (designer, Gabriella Slade) is a bravura affair in every way. WNO Youth Opera draw their performers from students at the Royal Welsh College, at the Birmingham Conservatoire, and from participants in their own youth schemes; but you would think that they were entirely young professionals, so polished and assured is their vocal delivery, so completely disciplined and punctilious their acting and movement in what is by any standards an exceptionally complex arena. To name any of this large cast individually would be invidious. Alice Farnham conducts the WNO orchestra with unobtrusive authority.

189,"Béatrice et Bénédict, Glyndebourne",Béatrice et Bénédict,Glyndebourne,2016-07-28,David Nice,"Locations count for little in most of Shakespeare's comedies. Only a literal-minded director would, for instance, insist on Messina, Sicily as the setting for Much Ado About Nothing. In Béatrice et Bénédict, on the other hand, Berlioz injects his very odd Bardolatry with lashings of the southern Italian light and atmosphere he loved so much. So turning it all grey as Laurent Pelly does and putting everyone into boxes except the loving enemies who think outside them - get it? - goes against the grain. But then colour is leached away from just about everything in this far from vintage Glyndebourne eveningBerlioz doesn't make it easy to animate his oblique take on the much more nuanced original. None of the crucial situations in Shakespeare - the gulling of Beatrice and Benedict into believing that each is loved by the other, the crucial scene where they admit what they've been hiding beneath their barbs - gets set to music. The whole plot whereby an initially anaemic - and, in the right hands, not so secondary - pair of lovers find themselves emotionally challenged by the machinations of a villain who doesn't feature in the opera goes out the window. That makes soprano Héro a cipher with lovely music, her fiancé Claudio a non-part and the verbal fencers defenceless without something to react against (who can forget Beatrice's ""Kill Claudio"" in a good production of the play?) To be fair, Pelly does encourage Agathe Mélinand to restore more Shakespearean lines to the dialogue, but it's not enough.The plus ought to be the unexpected intermezzi which are the highlights of the score - the duet for Héro and Ursule, the trio in which similar music finds them joined by Béatrice (pictured above), the poetry of the ensuing chorus. But all Pelly can find for the usually ravishing nocturne is a box with a wedding dress inside while grey skies persist behind (it was some compensation that the real grey skies had given way to sunshine as we emerged at the interval from this disappointment). It's the worst kind of production in which an idea is allowed to run riot and dominate an entire show - though Pelly's regular set designer Barbara de Limburg, trademark creator of the supermarket witch's house in his superb Glyndebourne Hänsel und Gretel, works wonders within the narrow stylistic exercise.The voices don't help. Sophie Karthäuser, Héro in a terrible blonde wig for the first half of the run - pray that Anne-Catherine Gillet is better if you have tickets for the second - lacks the lyric-soprano warmth just as Stéphanie d'Oustrac has no sensuality in her distinctive mezzo (though she's a vivid stage presence and can at least sing pianissimo in her aria, the less disappointing of the two big solo numbers for the ladies). At least Karthäuser blends well with the Ursule of Katarina Bradié - not the case with the two singers at the awful RSC Shakespeare gala earlier this year.It's true that Glyndebourne lost its intended Héro, Hélène Guilmette, and, for the whole of this season, its brilliant chief conductor Robin Ticciati, well on the way to recovery after an operation for a herniated disc. His replacement, Antonello Manacorda, is competent and precise but lacks élan, though the London Philharmonic Orchestra plays well throughout; I was saddened but not surprised when a newcomer told me she found the overture a bore, because in the right hands it's a cut-and-thrust gem.The much-touted Bénédict, Paul Appleby, starts brightly but sounds rough in the upper register when he should ping out his seeming insouciance.The only other role of any significance is crass music-master Somarone, in the divertissement Berlioz provided to substitute for the knockabout of Dogberry and Verges. Let's face it, he's not funny, though Pelly and the admirable Lionel Lhote do their best. The Glyndebourne Chorus (pictured above with Lhote) are the real stars. They get some lovely music as well as Pelly's trademark crispness of mass semaphoring, but they can't claim to stand alongside ace soloists, as their 1992 counterparts did when Glyndebourne took over the Royal Festival Hall during the construction of the new house was taking shape (such memories of Anne-Sofie von Otter, Dawn Upshaw, Jerry Hadley, Jean Rigby).The best solo voices are the flutes which punctuate the Nocturne. That would suggest that there's not enough to praise; sorry, you're in for a mostly dreary evening if you have yet to see it. With the new Barber of Seville also not as funny as it should be, that makes two misfires for Glyndebourne on the new productions front; by all accounts the failsafe Grandage Figaro shines brighter than ever this year with a superb cast, and the vintage Peter Hall production of A Midsummer Night's Dream coming soon shouldn't disappoint. A greater Berlioz homage to Shakespeare, Roméo et Juliette, should make amends at the Proms on Saturday.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/b%C3%A9atrice-et-b%C3%A9n%C3%A9dict-glyndebourne,2
190,"Prom 11: Wilson, Creswell, BBC National Orchestra and Chorus of Wales, Wigglesworth",Prom 11: Wilson,Creswell,2016-07-24,David Nice,"It's not often you think you detect a future Brünnhilde in a soprano performing a great Verdi role, but that was the case when American Tamara Wilson made her UK debut last autumn as a stunning Leonora in the ENO production of Verdi's The Force of Destiny. So would she sing the Ring? Not for 10 years at least, she said. But then Mark Wigglesworth, a conductor she knew she could trust as partner, proposed the final scene of Die Walküre at the Proms, and the rest should go down in history.Not that just the last father-daughter confrontation, albeit one of the greatest in all opera, is an entirely satisfactory choice without at least the rest of the act preceding it - though, odd as it looked on paper albeit rare vintage Proms programming this year, it worked perfectly well coming before Tippett's A Child of Our Time, in which Wilson also seared in the spiritual soprano role. But it took her no time at all to impress on our minds her own image of Wotan's disobedient valkyrie daughter, sorrowful but still fiercely defiant. After a few minutes of airborne, lighter than usual Ride of the Valkyries, the BBC National Orchestra of Wales' woodwind ensemble did the set-up work, Wigglesworth shaping heartbreak phrases before the first of many hushed but perfectly-projected lines from Wilson.You couldn’t fault her in verbal intelligence, subtlety and every readable reaction in that beautiful face when she wasn’t singing; but above all it’s the placement of the extraordinary instrument, never too low that it makes any singing in the higher register effortful, which should see her through to a sustained career in the big Wagner roles (though there’s no reason why she shouldn’t keep on singing Mozart and bel canto too).Her Wotan was bass James Creswell, the Father Superior who tortured her Leonora so in the best stretch of Calixto Bieito’s ENO Force of Destiny. Stentorian and diction-clear, he can't or won't sing softly, which meant that Wotan’s inner voice of love and conscience couldn’t really deepen the picture. But, once he’d had a discreet cough, the summoning of Loge was as thrilling as it could be. Wigglesworth proved flexible in tempi, supportive of the singers and moving things on for them if necessary but taking all the time in the world for what we had to imagine as the great embrace of father and daughter before Wotan puts Brünnhilde to sleep and surrounds her rock with fire. This was pure Goodall slow burn, the climax perfectly gauged just as that Wagnerian master knew how to achieve it. I’m well aware that from my position in the Albert Hall we were getting the brass head on, so balances may sound more effective on the radio and TV broadcasts.Wigglesworth has mentioned how “The world turns on its dark side” were the words that strikingly greeted him as he opened the score to study Tippett’s A Child of Our Time. This was always going to be a topical cause for reflection, and how much more so now that desperate teenager Herschel Grynszpan’s assassination of a Nazi official finds a different reflection in the horror of Munich, triggered by an alienated child of our own time. So much else here resonates about the state of the world and the plight of the refugee: “they shall not work, nor draw a dole./Let them starve in No-Man’s-Land” declare the Chorus of the Self-righteous.Not that Tippett’s early work is a masterpiece throughout; the relentless if necessary greyness of all bar the redemptive ending and the spirituals, the equivalent of the chorales in Bach’s Passions, can be hard going, while the words sometimes stick in the craw. Though the fragmentary nature of the work’s shape gives little indication that Tippett would become a great opera composer – ENO unwisely chose to stage the work, and I can’t remember a thing about it - Wigglesworth urged the magnificent forces of the BBC National Orchestra and (huge) Chorus of Wales to find meaning and urgency throughout.The textural clarity was astonishing from so many choral voices, and reflected in the soloists – Susan Bickley, the ever-amazing Peter Hoare as the Boy, and a returning Wilson and Creswell. The payoff was a lead-in to the final “Deep River” of supernatural beauty – woodwind again took the lead, balancing the sorrow of Brünnhilde’s plight with Tippett finding his true voice in a pastoral of spring – which Wigglesworth managed to sustain until the breathtaking final cut-off (those choral rolls at “I want to cross over” will never be forgotten). Wilson’s artistry was the icing on this black bread; again she floated the high phrases in some effortless pianissimos. The ultimate challenge in that respect is to come in the “Libera me” of Verdi’s Requiem on the penultimate night (9 September); you can rest assured that she’ll tick every expressive box in that even bigger challenge.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/prom-11-wilson-creswell-bbc-national-orchestra-and-chorus-wales-wigglesworth,5
191,"The Golden Dragon, Music Theatre Wales, Buxton Festival",The Golden Dragon,Music Theatre Wales,2016-07-19,Richard Bratby,"It’s the kitchen of a Thai-Chinese-Vietnamese fast food restaurant. The onstage orchestra wear sweatbands and T-shirts, and a red work surface stretches across the stage. As the four chefs take the stage, the clatter of pans and knives is first noise, then a rhythm, then an overture of sizzling, clanging, chopping and hissing sounds that spreads throughout the whole orchestra. Vegetables are sliced, pans brandished and, sitting out front, as an escaped slice of courgette rolls wonkily downstage, is a young Chinese cook, wailing with toothache. No question, Peter Eötvös knows how to create an arresting opening – and the first scene of his new opera The Golden Dragon pulls you headfirst into its claustrophobic, compelling and slightly crazy world.The Golden Dragon is the name of said restaurant, and the opera – adapted from a play by Roland Schimmelpfennig and performed in an English translation by Gregory Vajda – tells the story of one evening in its kitchen. Stories and lives collide, immigrants long for home, and that case of toothache takes a macabre and tragic turn. Counterpointed against it all is a retelling of Aesop’s fable of the Cricket and the Ant, given a particularly nasty anti-capitalist twist.Llio Evans's story holds everything together This is an opera with a point to make, so it’s regrettable that the characters are described simply as “Asians” and that Eötvös’s score makes such ready use of the clichés of musical orientalism: gongs and gamelan effects. True, the recurring gong strokes are artfully distorted, and doubtless the intention was to critique oriental clichés in western music. The problem, of course, being that music that’s intended satirically has a habit of sounding indistinguishable from the real thing.That aside, this UK premiere production by Music Theatre Wales is a compelling, entertaining and ultimately affecting 90 minutes of music drama. There’s a wit to Eötvös’s effects: the characters regularly drop out of character, offering spoken commentary on the action, and suddenly changing nationality and sex. The sight of the two alpha males of the kitchen, Johnny Herford and the imposingly tattooed Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts, as handbag-toting air stewardesses, drew giggles from the Buxton crowd; as did the orchestra’s deadpan practice of announcing “Long Pause” or “Short Pause” in the gaps in the music.More importantly, the whole company was on top not only of Eötvös’s gnarlier vocal writing, but the numerous stretches where the music took real lyrical flight. Lucy Schaufer was clear and compassionate as the Woman Over Sixty, Andrew Mackenzie-Wicks camped it up cheerfully as the Waitress, and everyone on stage was equally convincing when called upon to transform themselves instantaneously and repeatedly into insects, grandparents, or teenage girls. It’s a tribute to the clarity of the libretto – and Michael McCarthy’s direction – that the many strands of the story unfolded so comprehensibly.And it’s a particular tribute to Eötvös’s playful, endlessly subtle score. Throughout, the orchestra under Geoffrey Paterson underlined and commented upon the action, shimmering, chiming, dissolving into gnat squeaks or lurching quietly, queasily downwards as something nasty turns up in the soup. Above all, though, it’s a tribute to Llio Evans’s (pictured right) performance as the one character who doesn’t shift identity, and whose story holds everything together: that toothache-suffering Chinese immigrant, described throughout as The Little One. Scruffily dressed, Evans made a touching figure: trusting, pleading, grappling all the time with a pain that – it only gradually became apparent – went far beyond an infected tooth.In telling the story of individuals to whom society gives no voice, it was inspired touch from Eötvös to make so much of The Little One’s music wordless (at one point she squeaked through a gag). Only after The Little One’s lifeless body is floating away downriver does she finally get to sing out, sweetly and radiantly, in the great poignant aria of homecoming and loss towards which the whole work, it’s finally clear, has been building. Eötvös stops joking, stops twitching, and provides an orchestral accompaniment whose dark, juddering iridescence sounds like nothing so much as the Lake of Tears from Bartók’s Bluebeard’s Castle. Intentional? Ironic? What matters is that it feels like he means it – and that we feel it too.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/golden-dragon-music-theatre-wales-buxton-festival,4
192,"Jenůfa, Longborough Festival Opera",Jenůfa,Longborough Festival Opera,2016-07-18,stephen Walsh,"Quite apart from its inherent power, Jenůfa always amazes me by the way it seems to pluck a new language out of thin air, then use it to carry one of the most moving and emotionally truthful works in the repertory. Its curiously staccato form of lyricism lays heavy demands on singers trained in Wagner or Verdi. But they usually rise to the challenge, and Richard Studer’s new production at Longborough is no exception, despite problems connected with the smallness of the stage and a certain resulting inhibition in aspects of the chorus work and movement.Maybe I’m a bit spoilt here by David Alden’s ENO production, which uses the immense Coliseum stage so well in the first act to emphasise the distance between these supposedly blood-related characters. Studer’s first act, complete with the mill wheel that Janáček has in his music as a kind of wheel of fate, is slightly cramped by an interior platform, and the dance music –somewhat tentative and untidy musically – loses much of that wild brilliance that the composer surely intended to throw the misery of his central characters into high relief.  But as soon as the drama closes in on Jenůfa  her worthless lover, Števa  and Števa's more complex half-brother, Laca, things improve to the point that the final scene, in which Laca refuses to abandon the disgraced and self-immolating Jenůfa  is even more unbearably moving than usual. A lot of the credit for this goes to Studer’s carefully observed character direction, done without the occasional vulgarity that Alden, even at his best, seems unable to resist.Studer’s handling of Laca is particularly convincing, making the awkward transition from his violent abuse of Jenůfa (such a vivid expression of thwarted passion), through his helpless pleading with her after her abandonment by Števa to the closing scene where the true depth of his love gives him a completely unexpected yet perfectly believable moral stature. It’s an ending that I’m sorry to say shows up the falsehood even of works one admires, like La Bohème, a musical favourite of mine, and oddly one that ends with a version of the same melody as Jenůfa. Did Janáček know it (1896/1903)? Puccini gave up on his only mature attempt to give a tragic opera a happy ending. But Janáček’s model for that was more likely Shakespeare.Daniel Norman (pictured right) provides a brilliant study of Laca, slightly older than one imagines him, balding and bearded, a loser in the making but turned into a winner by circumstance and moral opportunism. Lee Bissett’s Jenůfa is no less subtly observed, with a crucially measured acceptance of Laca, whom she doesn’t love in the way she has, dangerously, loved Števa. Her face is like a moving picture of the entire drama, and vocally she is as much in command of this terrifying range of emotion as I remember she was with Katya Kabanova here a few years ago. The other major performance here is Gaynor Keeble’s as the Kostelnička. On the level of melodrama, her outbursts of rage and passionate remorse would send any thermometer sky-high; but more importantly she captures the ambivalence of this remarkable character destroyed by precisely the emotional perception and rightness that motivate her palpably wrong behaviour in murdering Jenůfa’s baby.Minor characters are always important in Janáček  as they are in the Russian plays that clearly influenced him. Andrew Rees, also a curiously elderly Števa, manages well what always strikes me as a thankless, unredeemed part, an ordinary chap bemused by the strong feelings of complex folk. Alison Dunne is charming as the Pastuchyna, an important mediator of common humanity at the wedding, and Maria Jagusz is excellent as Grandmother Buryja, who presides over all this emotional mayhem as its historic cause. Mark Saberton as the mill foreman and Nazan Fikret as Števa's eventual bride, Karolka, contribute sharp, well-sung vignettes.Jonathan Lyness’s musical direction is less dependable than we’ve come to expect of him, though it grows in security as the temperature rises. Scrappy ensemble in the first act dances was probably due to poor offstage communication; but his tempi hereabouts are sluggish and the dances fail to vibrate. Later it all falls into place, and by the end all is forgiven.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/jenufa-longborough-festival-opera,4
193,"Prom 2: Boris Godunov, Royal Opera, Pappano",Prom 2: Boris Godunov,Royal Opera,2016-07-17,Gavin Dixon,"The Royal Opera’s Boris Godunov production made the short trip from Covent Garden to South Ken for the company’s appearance at the 2016 Proms. The opera (here in its original 1869 version) is a good choice for concert presentation: as Antonio Pappano writes in the programme, much of its music approaches oratorio. That is particularly true of the choral numbers, and the work is a tour de force for the Royal Opera Chorus. But every aspect of the music is this production is strong, so the gains balanced the losses, despite the minimal visual presentation.Little of Richard Jones’s visual presentation was retained, just the costumes and some of the Personenregie. Thankfully absent was the mime re-enactment of the Tsarevich’s murder, which is repeated ad nauseam in the staging. Without it, the conception is more straightforward, with the attention appropriately focused on Godunov himself, especially in the final scene. The interaction between the chorus, arranged around the back of the orchestra, and the leads was established in the opening scene with the police officer Nikitch (the first impressive bass of the evening, Jeremy White) and the suitably creepy Shiusky of John Graham-Hall addressing them from the front of the stage, from the start embracing the expansive performance space, and with it, the huge venue.Bryn Terfel (main picture) appeared as Boris for the coronation scene above the chorus, at the organ console. His resplendent robes made this an impressive entrance, but his soft-grained baritone struggled to carry from the distance. More problematic were the off-stage bells, placed high in the gallery, but still too loud and overpowering both the orchestra and chorus. A rare mis-step though, in an otherwise well-balanced presentation.The scene in the Chudov Monastery introduced the spectacular bass voice of Ain Anger as Pimen. Even in a cast dominated by low male voices Anger stood out for the presence and authority of his tone. David Butt Philip was just as convincing as Grigory the novice-cum-false-Dmitry, looking and sounding sufficiently young to make the role credible. No chance of getting the chorus off-stage to accompany his monologue though, so they just had to sing very, very quietly.One of the highlights of this production at Covent Garden was John Tomlinson’s comic turn as Varlaam in the border scene. Sadly, Tomlinson wasn’t here this evening, but Andrii Goniukov (pictured below) was just as good. Goniukov had been made up (make-up another of the few visual elements retained) to look almost identical to Tomlinson in the role, long beard and all. His double act with Harry Nicoll’s Missail – playing spoons – was pitch perfect.At Covent Garden, the part three scene with Godunov’s family is dominated by a huge map of Russia, one of the few props that was sorely missing here. Ben Knight was amplified a little in the role of Fyodor, but it was discreetly done and didn’t cramp his style. Back at Red Square for scene four, the chorus now felt too distant from the action, but the front-of-stage space was well used by the Simpleton and his crowd of unruly urchins. Andrew Tortise’s portrayal of the Simpleton was another highlight of the Covent Garden staging, and remained so here.But the final scenes belonged to Bryn Terfel. Now front of stage, any concerns about projection were laid to rest. The absence of staging here gave even greater power to the personal interactions, Godunov’s anger at the Simpleton, frustrated rage with Shiusky and tender affection for Fyodor. The Welsh lilt in Terfel’s Russian was always apparent, yet the clarity of his diction was superlative. And the focused concentration he brought gave the death scene a claustrophobic intimacy unchallenged by the scale of the venue.Top honours, then, for Terfel, the star attraction, but in a performance strong on all counts. And a final word of praise for Antonio Pappano, whose strong grip on the score has been a key factor in the success of this production. His tempos here are suitably rigorous, with rubato used sparingly, to articulate large-scale structure rather than to decorate individual phrases. There was also a strong feeling that he was leading an integrated team, an ensemble that knows the piece intimately and is able get the very best from it, even in these alien surroundings. A very promising start to the opera strand in this year’s Proms.@saquabote",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/prom-2-boris-godunov-royal-opera-pappano,4
194,"Falstaff, CBSO, Gardner, Symphony Hall Birmingham",Falstaff,CBSO,2016-07-14,Richard Bratby,"Edward Gardner gives the downbeat, and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra bursts into Verdi’s great opening guffaw. Enter stage left Graham Clark, as Dr Caius. Enter stage right Ambrogio Maestri, as Falstaff. And before a note has been sung, the audience is laughing. I know that in the post-Dumpygate era we’re not supposed to discuss a singer’s physical appearance. It’s just that everything about Maestri – his stature, his gait, his rolling eyes, his genial manner and his big rubbery smile – suggests that he was born to play the Fat Knight. He simply is Falstaff.That being so, he’s not merely witty in himself, but the cause that wit is in others. His very presence on stage creates a glow of warmth and good humour. It made an excellent starting point for this concert performance, the final instalment in the CBSO’s Our Shakespeare season. Concert performances of opera are an annual CBSO fixture, and a necessary one in a Second City that sees fewer than 25 live performances (seriously: performances, not productions) of opera per year. Andris Nelsons has been at the helm for most of the last decade, and some might say this was an overdue chance for the CBSO’s principal guest conductor to give Birmingham a taste of what ENO audiences enjoyed for eight years.One change was noticeable immediately. Nelsons’s various Wagner and Strauss operas were concert performances, with singers parked very firmly at music stands. No director was credited tonight but Gardner’s cast gave what was almost a semi-staging – entering, exiting, darting about and forming conspiratorial huddles on either side of the stage. The men chose their own variations on evening dress – Nicholas Pallesen (Ford) in black and white patent leather shoes, Peter van Hulle (Bardolfo) in a grubby top and cut-off trousers – and the lights dimmed to create the moonlight mood of Act Three. Seeing a suitably red nosed Hulle dangling his legs over the front of the stage, or Fenton (Sam Furness) and Nannetta (Sofa Fomina) tiptoeoing through the percussion section, all added hugely to the sense of theatre – and fun.And Gardner certainly knows how to assemble a cast. Corinne Winters (pictured below), as Alice Ford, was a perfectly chosen foil for Maestri: all knowing smiles, flashing eyes and sassy self-confidence, with a voice as bright as it was expressive. Falstaff didn't stand a chance. Jane Henschel found tenderness as well as a hint of steel as a Mistress Quickly who was very much one of the girls while Clark, Hulle and Lukas Jakobski (Pistola) made a suitably gangly bunch of reprobates; reedy of tone and exuberantly in character (it helped that Hulle is small enough to be physically lifted off his feet and bounced up and down by Maestri).The darkness of Justina Gringyte’s mezzo as Meg Page was nicely chosen to set off Winters’s soprano, just as Pallesen’s tighter, harder-edged baritone made him a suitable contrast and adversary for Falstaff: a combative figure, with a menacing flash of Iago in his jealous outbursts. And gleaming through it all, Fomina’s sweet, sunlit singing as Nannetta: a luminous performance, which Furness (deputising for an indisposed Allan Clayton) matched in ardour if not sonic beauty.They played off each other like a dream, and it would be a joy to see this lot together on stage. At times, it really felt like they were - swept along by Gardner’s brisk, fluid tempi and the all-pervading presence of Maestri: whether singing a mocking falsetto as warmly and richly as his great monologues, sitting back and drumming his fingers with a huge, satisfied smirk, or unleashing a truly volcanic surge of black, sonorous tone.Unfortunately, he needed to do that: the one serious problem with this performance was balance. With an orchestra who were audibly straining at the leash, you can understand why Gardner must have been tempted to let rip. The CBSO sounded like they were having the time of their lives, launching themselves at Verdi’s score like they were playing a Strauss tone poem. The result was that passages such as the Act Three fairy music felt a lot more physically present and less magical than they might have done, while big climaxes were almost painfully loud. Maestri, voice swelling like some glorious tailcoated bullfrog, could power through: not everyone could. In Symphony Hall’s acoustic, that really shouldn’t happen.Still, in this of all operas, holding back isn’t really the point. This may not have been the subtlest Falstaff, but its heart was right where it should be. The laughs in that first scene just kept coming. Elspeth Dutch’s offstage horn solo was enchantingly misty and poetic and by the end, with Maestri beaming at the audience and the assembled cast smiling and embracing even as Verdi’s closing fugue was still whizzing to its finish, the sense of enjoyment in the hall was irresistible. Tutta nel mondo è burla: after the best part of a decade of German operatic opulence in Birmingham, there couldn’t have been a happier or healthier way to break the Nelsons spell.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/falstaff-cbso-gardner-symphony-hall-birmingham,4
195,"Leonore, I Capuleti e i Montecchi, Buxton Festival",Leonore,I Capuleti e i Montecchi,2016-07-10,Robert Beale,"The first two of the three in-house opera productions in this year’s Buxton Festival could be bracketed under a slogan of ""love stories, Jim – but not quite as we know them"". Bellini’s  I Capuleti e i Montecchi is, of course, Romeo and Juliet … sort of. She comes round in time to sing a duet with Romeo, who is himself a mezzo en travesti, so it’s not Shakespeare. More of that later. Leonore , on the other hand, is very much Beethoven: in fact 20 minutes more Beethoven than you get in Fidelio, the version the composer created nine years after his original three-acter, and which we know better today.So the case for doing the long one must surely be that there’s wonderful music in it that deserves to get a hearing. Festival artistic director (and conductor) Stephen Barlow believes that – he’s not the only maestro to think so, and he’s done it before – and he and director Stephen Medcalf also aver it has a better claim to work as drama.I think they have a point. The later Fidelio always seems to lurch from domestic comedy to high-minded rescue drama too early on, and Beethoven’s original gave him more opportunity to develop the Jacquino-Marzelline-Leonore-Rocco relationship in its own right, and to do it in a half-comic, half-serious, Mozartian way. There’s a duet for Marzelline and Jacquino (""Jetzt, jetzt"") which is very fine – as she measures up various noble prisoners for their dungeon garb – and a remarkable trio with Rocco which hints at dimensions of tragedy impending. The famous canon-quartet ""Mir ist so wunderbar"" becomes a climactic pivot in its own right.On the other hand, we get a duet for Marzelline and Leonore, with solo violin obbligato, which goes on a bit (and was not played particularly well on the first night); Leonore's ""Komm’, Hoffnung"" is introduced by a less effective passage than ""Abscheulicher!"" in the later version; and the denouement is extended with a finale, allowing a crisis of confidence for the happy couple after ""O namenlose Freude!"", which diminishes the effect of Don Fernando’s arrival and setting all to rights.Still, on balance, the case for Leonore is proved. Medcalf has gone one better than that, though. He thinks the whole opera is a fantasy about Beethoven’s inner life. During the overture (Leonore No. 2, as used in 1805) we see the composer at his fortepiano, struggling with his Heiligenstadt predicament and his ear-trumpet and dreaming of a woman’s love; that violin obbligato is played by Leonore on a fiddle she happens to have with her; later, when Rocco is digging a grave in the dungeon, we’re among the detritus of the composer’s thwarted dreams. Then freedom for Florestan equals redemption for Ludwig: art and Das ewig Weibliche triumph together, and blow me, half the soldiers turn out to have been prisoners’ wives in disguise, and they’ve all come to free their guys.It’s pretty surreal in the end. But then, maybe that’s the story of the opera. The singers are a strong team, with young David Danholt making an extremely good impression as Florestan and Kirstin Sharpin bringing a big voice and control over most of it to Leonore. Hrólfur Sæmundsson sang Pizarro with some good tone and bad-guy relish (getting panto-style boos at the curtain call), and Scott Wilde’s emphatic Rocco was much appreciated (though a bit raw near the top of the range).I liked Kristy Swift’s feisty Marzelline most of all for her comic acting and flexible soprano, and Stuart Laing made a reasonable fist of the hapless Jacquino. Jonathan Best gave some gravity to Don Fernando. Stephen Barlow drew generally excellent playing from the Northern Chamber Orchestra, whose sound fills this lovely small opera house ideally, and the chorus, with its large extra male contingent, sang very well (trainer Matthew Morley).In both operas the set (Francis O’Connor for Leonore, Yannis Thavoris for  I Capuleti) sensibly encloses the stage, reflecting sound out of it. And in  I Capuleti e i Montecchi (scene pictured below) what lovely sounds! It’s a bel canto opera, and in Stephanie Marshall (Romeo) and Sarah-Jane Brandon (Giulietta) Buxton has hired singers fit for purpose. Their voices shone individually and blended in their duets, from the great first act climax, with exciting and poised singing from both and cadenzas as skilfully acted as sung (no stopping to think about the notes here). The latter demonstrated excellent control of mezza voce and real emotional presence, and the former was in warm, full voice through to the final scene.There are only three other principals in this version of the story (we begin where Romeo has killed Juliet’s brother, and the two families are at daggers – and pistols – drawn). Jonathan Best sang Capellio (Giulietta’s father) with his customary incisiveness and dominance of the stage; Luis Gomes brought an unstrained high tenor timbre to Tebaldo (the man she’s meant to marry); Lorenzo is both priest and soldier and, though something of a stooge to Capellio in plot terms, was finely sung by Julian Tovey.Justin Doyle – shortly to become chief conductor and artistic director of the RIAS Kammerchor and well known for his work with Opera North and elsewhere – piloted the opera with a sure hand, with flexible and energetic rhythms and some beautiful instrumental solos from the NCO (the principal horn and harp in Giulietta’s ""O quante volte"", in particular). The festival male chorus were again very strong, and well abetted by more girls in uniform.Harry Fehr’s gifts as director are not new to us in this part of the country. He sets the opera in the present day in some Balkanised, divided nation where warlords rule, and provides movement and action whenever the score requires it (and, in its leisurely cavatina introductions such as the one for Romeo’s Crudel Lorenzo, it does), and sometimes as a bonus. There’s a very good fight for Romeo and Tebaldo (Paul Benzing), and these star-cross’d lovers know how to die while singing like angels.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/leonore-i-capuleti-e-i-montecchi-buxton-festival,4
196,"The Magic Flute, Iford Manor Garden",The Magic Flute,Iford Manor Garden,2016-07-09,David Nice,"To reach Sarastro's temple of wisdom, you have to climb a series of exquisitely manicured terraces to a tiny cloister in one of the world's great gardens. Iford Arts have been inviting high-quality small opera companies to perform and produce their own operas since 2005. Charles Court Opera, paragon of G&S and boutique panto, was the right team to ask to provide a Magic Flute tailored for a cast of nine and an audience of 80.The peripherals matter here, not least because you can enjoy a picnic in peace and quiet before the show, unencumbered by evening dress (""smart casual"" is the suggestion), in surroundings which give Glyndebourne and Garsington a run for their money. Iford Manor Garden creates the illusion of spaciousness in what is in fact a narrow strip sloping down to the river Avon. A genius in marrying stonework to careful planting, Harold Peto knew where to place his collection of Italian antiquities, and the translated Renaissance cloister is at the zenith of the garden before the wild woods with their high trees begin.Within it, Charles Court Opera's designer Simon Bejer has enclosed the courtyard with overhead vines. Tamino is an explorer seeking enlightenment, not a prince, lost in a South American jungle and Papageno's pipes give the cue for Andean colour in his and Papagena's cheery costumes. Director John Savournin and conductor John Eaton have given Schikaneder's mix of Freemasonry and vaudeville a complete makeover in their new translation so that there's no serpent, at least not when you expect it, no portrait of Pamina to lead Tamino onwards – later, though, there's play with two dolls – and various substitutes for the Three Boys supposed to lead the hero and his sidekick onwards.Those find Savournin at his most resourceful, and ask much more than usual from the Three Ladies. Catrine Kirkman, who last year gave one of the funniest stage turns ever as an Essex girl plaintiff in CCO's consummate Trial by Jury, doubles as Papagena, and all three team up with a giant head to play the Old Woman eventually transfigured into birdwoman. Kirkman, Lucinda Stuart-Grant and Amy J Payne (another G&S stalwart; all three pictured above with John-Colyn Gyeantey) not only serve as the choral sect-members but also manipulate glow-worm lights, snakes and bird-puppets as this production's answer to the ""Boys"".The most enchanting scene of all is that of Pamina rescued by the cheery birds from suicide when she thinks Tamino no longer loves her. It's superbly sung by all four women, too. Guildhall student Claire Lees is the discovery of the evening: no sooner has one lyric soprano, Louise Alder, graduated and taken wing than another appears on the scene. Lees has wonderful pluck and dignity, looks like a young Julianne Moore and manages all the difficult phrases, above all in Pamina's lament, to radiant perfection. Like Alder, she'll make a radiant Sophie in Der Rosenkavalier and her Pamina would already grace any stage.There's delightful interplay, too, between her and John-Colyn Gyeantey's Tamino: first meeting and reconciliation – ""Tamino mine"" as moving as it was when Lucy Crowe sang it at ENO – hit the heights. Gyeantey's fast vibrato takes some adjusting to; Hannah Sawle as the Queen of the Night (pictured above), looking like a cross between Amy Winehouse and Martita Hunt as David Lean's Miss Havisham, is even more extreme in that respect, but unlike many she has all the top notes.Certainly, though, Gyeantey is the real tenor article, and his musicality soon wins us over; the other highlight of the evening is the urgency of Tamino's scene with the Speaker, here also the Sarastro, Benjamin Cahn (pictured below). A baritone, maybe, rather than a bass, though he could manage the low notes. Curious, too, that the American accent of this Inca chief inclined us to think of the noble Sarastro as a jargony cult leader;  Savournin and Eaton clearly want us to take the wisdom seriously, and make a pertinent reference to recent events in a plea not to take everything that's said by immoral people at face value (""think critically"").There I take issue with the idea that this Tamino sets the flute aside as part of the superstitious apparatus and tells Pamina they must face the final trial with their own knowledge alone. Cut the trials of fire and water and the most movingly simple music of the opera which goes with them, and you leave a gaping hole. In any case the one thing this production badly needs is reflective space, a will to trust the intimacy with some quieter singing and to relax the pace.Eaton gets authentic liveliness from his 12-piece orchestra but sometimes drives them and the singers too hard. There are some fine solos, especially from the oboe, and it's a luxury under the circumstances to have a real Mozartian glockenspiel for Papageno's wind-up musical box.Every word can be heard, but less would sometimes be more, especially from the Papageno of Matthew Kellett, who's usually very funny indeed. Take these as production notes, though; this Flute already has the makings of a very fine show, creating and sustaining a world with help from the pillars and arches of Iford's unique little cloister-""theatre"". The overall experience merits much more than the three stars reluctantly applied here.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/magic-flute-iford-manor-garden,3
197,"Il Trovatore, Royal Opera",Il Trovatore,Royal Opera,2016-07-06,David Nice,"That often-repeated truism about Verdi's craziest melodrama, that it needs four of the world's greatest voices, makes no mention of acting ability. Given the top-notch international approach to this kind of opera, impressively fielded by what's called ""Cast A"" here, German director David  Bösch was right to build a dark, consistent visual world around mostly stand-and-deliver performances rather than demand too much of his stars. Conductor Gianandrea Noseda's febrile, focused musicality helps Bösch and his team deliver the essence of this tricky masterpiece.Noseda's is the most impressive approach to Verdi style since Mark Wigglesworth's firing-up of an even more difficult case in the canon, The Force of Destiny, at ENO. Yet where Wigglesworth was dark and deep, Noseda prefers light and springy. There are points in the hell-for-leather conclusions to duets and trios where you might want a little more hell-fire, but the swiftness certainly drives home the incredible daring of Verdi's often elliptical approach to operatic formulas, making a virtue even out of the endlessly repeated ballad-style repetitions of the plot's pre-history: in short, that a gypsy was driven so mad by her mother's burning as a witch that she threw her own baby onto a bonfire by mistake. The set-up is urgently delivered at the start by Maurizio Muraro's captain Ferrando in front of a tank and a questioning male chorus sounding more expressively as one than I've ever heard them (pictured below).Bösch and his set/video designer Patrick Bannwart give us a black, white and silver setting in time of near-contemporary warfare, turning orange-red when the flames arise. Crude graffiti gives way to naive illustrations of the back-story with figures dangerously – deliberately? – close to the big-eyed kids of Margaret Keane. Principal soprano Leonora's love for troubadour Manrico, out of joint with the nasty times, emanates butterflies and hearts. The Spanish gypsy crew could be out of Almodóvar or Bieito – shades of his widely-seen Carmen – but Bösch is more disciplined as they bring circus colour to the darkness; Azucena, understandably driven halfway to madness by her past atrocity, inhabits a caravan with baby dolls pinned to the doors.We swallow all this because the musical expression is so persuasive, down to Jette Parke Young Artists Jennifer Davis and David Junghoon Kim making their presences felt in the smallest of roles. Lianna Haroutounian has been a real asset to the Royal Opera since she stepped in after Anja Hartetos completed one performance as Elisabetta in Don Carlo. Haroutounian is that rarity, a soprano who can manage both the coloratura and the warm urgency of Leonora's huge, arching phrases. She sometimes sings sharp – chiefly in the Miserere as the heroine responds desperately to her death-sentenced lover's voice somewhere beyond the barbed wire – but that's a fault of generosity where flat notes would be a sign of under-energised delivery.Francesco Meli as the testosterone-driven tenor hero (pictured above with Željko Lučić, left, and Haroutounian) delivers all the goods, only the now-obligatory top C at the end of ""Di quella pira"" a bit short of Pavarotti lustre. But he can sing softly and ardently – the preceding Romanza is superb – as well as loudly. Which is about the measure of Željko Lučić as the dark side of the love-triangle, bloodthirsty Count di Luna – a coarse but effective version of the standard but hard-to-find Verdi baritone.The even harder-to-find Verdi mezzo is best of all. Ekaterina Semenchuk as Azucena is the one of the principal quartet who could probably manage more nuanced acting than is asked of her. She has it all: the flaming top notes, the cutting chest voice, the most intensive pianissimos which make her death's-door lullaby ""Ai nostri monti"" so affecting (Meli rises, or diminishes, to the occasion, too). There's no doubt about it: Semenchuk is not only the Azucena but also the Eboli and Amneris for our age, a more urgent actress than her Russian senior Olga Borodina who's owned these roles for so long.In those surprisingly harrowing closing stages Bösch and Bannwart are at their finest, keeping the violence on both sides to a minimum in the atrocities threatened on three token male prisoners-of-war and leaving the stage clear for the main characters, stripped of all illusions. Big Eyes melt into black horrors and a gigantic pyre rises effectively behind crushed hopes. The final gesture is a strong conclusion to a parallel universe which you may love or hate – violent mutterings of protest were all around me, though sadly not the bravos that should have greeted such fine singing – but which is in tune with this most bizarre and most easily-parodied of all Verdi's operas. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/il-trovatore-royal-opera,4
198,"Götterdämmerung, Opera North, Southbank Centre",Götterdämmerung,Opera North,2016-07-04,alexandra Coghlan,"And so it ends: Hagen drowns, Valhalla burns, and the ring returns to the Rhine, while somewhere beneath – Wagner’s dawn trumpets sounding faintly in the distance – the dwarf Alberich continues his lonely scheming. It would be hard to find a more apt conclusion to a week of power-grabbing and back-stabbing than Götterdämmerung, and harder still to see its climactic conflagration as anything other than horribly prophetic. But where politics wreak chaos, so art must console, and this Ring cycle is consolation at its absolute purest and most ecstatic.Opera North’s Ring has been such a triumph that it’s easy to forget that it was a project forged as a creative response to lack – an austerity Ring that has proved that less really can be more, if only you get your priorities right. Hopefully the powers that be at English National Opera have been taking notes from this ambitious distillation of Wagner’s gesamtkunstwerk into a cycle of concert stagings where simple projections and superb acting fill the space where elaborate design and directorial concept would normally be.Director Peter Mumford’s deft blend of symbols and landscapes, split across three giant screens at the back of the Royal Festival Hall stage, helps not only evoke but anchor the action playing out below. Short narrative summaries (written, oddly, in the past tense) also help, minimally intrusive in the context of so much musical drama. But none of this would satisfy if the cast couldn’t carry the show. The staging may be a concert one, but the performances are of opera house intensity and conviction. Delivered directly out to the audience, and at such close proximity, it’s Wagner with the whites of its eyes visible, gloriously, intrusively intimate.From the three glassy-eyed Norns (thrillingly sung by Fiona Kimm, Yvonne Howard, Lee Bisset, pictured right) searching for meaning somewhere above the Stalls, to the brooding Hagen (Mats Almgren), enlisting the audience as co-conspirators in his plan, we’re complicit here are we never are in the opera house. The desperate glances of Andrew Foster-Williams’s increasingly disturbed Gunther fall directly on us, pleading for deliverance from a plan spiralling swiftly out of control.Once again, conductor Richard Farnes plays a long game, only rarely letting Opera North’s brass section off the leash, and even deploying thicker brushstrokes of woodwind and chorus colour sparingly. While this approach (sensitive though it is to the needs of the singers) has drawn criticism earlier in the cycle, here, with such a climax to build to, it makes for deliciously deferred pleasure. It also goes a long way to solving both the issues of balance and acoustic clarity in this awkward space, drawing the ear consistently to the middle of the orchestra, in contrast to the dominant texture of tenor and soprano among the voices.A large part of the pleasure of this cycle has come from Farnes’s world-class company of singers, often returning in different roles through the sequence of operas. Here Giselle Allen (a glorious Freia earlier this week) donned her third guise, this time as Gutrune. Passionate and awkward in equal measure, she discovered all the human warmth lacking in Foster-Williams’s exquisitely chilly and self-controlled Gunther (pictured left with Allen). Mats Almgren swapped Fafner’s greedy ambition for Hagen’s, prowling up and down the thin strip of stage with simian ease and matching the double-basses for chalky blackness of tone.But Götterdämmerung belongs to Siegfried and Brünnhilde, and never more so than in the hands of Mati Turi and Kelly Cae Hogan. Where Lars Cleveman couldn’t quite match Hogan in Siegfried, Turi certainly can, and the result is an ecstatic, heavyweight battle of emotions and voices. Hogan’s legato spins evenly, uniting the sweetness and glow of the top of the voice with the dryer, more brittle bottom. Turi’s homespun, bonhomous hero gives her poised heroine plenty to bounce off, and there’s real poignancy in watching this Brünnhilde try to bridge the gap in the feminine softness of her Act I music.Staged in the opera house, the Ring never travels light, laden as it is with historical, conceptual and technical baggage. Stripped of much of these, Richard Farnes, Peter Mumford and their team have discovered a lighter, more aerodynamic Ring for a new age and a new audience.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/g%C3%B6tterd%C3%A4mmerung-opera-north-southbank-centre,5
199,"Siegfried, Opera North, Southbank Centre",Siegfried,Opera North,2016-07-02,Peter Quantrill,"For some of us, Siegfried is a perfect opera. Like L.627 it stubbornly observes the Aristotelian rules of space and time to cut a generous slice of life. There are almost no set-pieces to break the flow of one-on-one conversations, accusations, confessions, arguments. These encounters are inevitably stifled by a concert staging, where singers address themselves to us, never to each other. Peter Mumford’s video projections set the scene with trees and glowing embers like a piece of slow TV on YouTube or BBC4.Wisdom also holds that Siegfried is the Scherzo of the Ring. Maybe not only for its position as the third part of the drama, in symphonic terms, but for its libretto, which banters with wit and irony, wordplay and sudden reversals. The surtitled translation did functional justice to Wagner’s text of Sophoclean nuance. Some of the singers swallowed their words, which didn’t help, but they were heard in solemn, all-too-reverent silence. This may be news to some, but Wagner wrote a few good jokes, most of them in Die Meistersinger and Siegfried, and none of them came over tonight.On the podium, Richard Farnes was a model of sobriety and clarity, always finding a bel canto line, in an acoustic never meant for this music. From the stalls we heard much of the Opera North strings, the brass were only let off the leash at climactic moments, the winds took their chances at stylishly controlled solo moments. Having let the Ring alone for 12 years to write Tristan and Die Meistersinger, Wagner built a bonfire of vanities in the Prelude to Act 3, piling on every major motif from the Ring so far. Farnes carefully piled up each log but took too long to light the touchpaper.On this showing, he would make a superb conductor of Liszt and Beethoven. Timbres were light and bright, but violas, tuba and timpani stood out in this most inner-part of operas. Leading to Brünnhilde’s awakening, the first violins took their treacherously exposed solo with exquisite, doubtless exhaustively rehearsed assurance.In the title role, Lars Cleveman warmed up after a dry first scene. A likely lad who needs a stronger lower register, said Stephen Walsh of his Bayreuth Tannhäuser, and that about sums it up. A size too small for the role, he was at least a size larger than Richard Roberts’ all-too-sympathetic Mime. Only with the Act 2 confrontation between the Wanderer (Béla Perencz) and Alberich (Jo Pohlheim pictured above right) did we hear singing of Wagnerian scale. Mats Almgren brought a properly cavernous bass but also real pathos to the dying Fafner. Within the staging’s literal frame of reference, Jeni Bern made a sweet and pertly sung Woodbird. Ceri Williams found ample time and genuine contralto timbre to sing a hieratically dignified Erda, while hardly evoking the confused earth-mother brought back against her will to a life out of balance.Only with the appearance of Kelly Cae Hogan’s Brünnhilde was the prosaic context conclusively banished. In the score’s weakest, most extended stretch, she sustained a glorious flood of old-fashioned soprano tone while bringing her character back to joyous, then richly ambivalent and finally exultant life. Hogan’s soprano is more mature, slightly wider, no less thrilling than Rachel Nicholls at Longborough: I’d listen to her again in anything.  Appeals to contemporary relevance can be tiresome, but Simon Rees’s translation hit the spot in the forging scene. ""Experts won’t help you, that’s clear,"" said Mime to Siegfried. ""Only his folly helps the fool."" The sun set in baleful orange over the House of Commons.

200,"Die Walküre, Opera North, Southbank Centre",Die Walküre,Opera North,2016-06-30,David Nice,"Enter the human - and superhuman demands for at least four of the singers - in the second, towering instalment of Wagner's Ring cycle. It says so much for Opera North's achievement so far that no one fell in any way short of the sometimes insane vocal demands. There were only varying degrees of characterisation and commitment, none of them less than fine.Bad luck, perhaps, that the lower, though not exactly low, temperatures came in the first act as we meet the hero Wotan has fathered as free agent, or so he thinks, and the heroine sister whose incestuous love is a case, as the chief god puts it, of ""just because something unexpected happens, it doesn’t mean it shouldn’t happen"". Really that fabulous storm at the start, with appropriately wild visuals again from Peter Mumford’s elemental video work, should hurl onto the stage a fugitive at the limits of his endurance. Michael Weinius didn’t quite suggest that in body and face; nor did Lee Bisset in her slinky evening wear impress upon us a buttoned-up, downtrodden housewife. Both (pictured below) struck vocal form immediately, though, going on to find rare intimacies in the midst of their infatuation with each other. But for once, and once only so far, the magic carpet of the Opera North orchestra responsive to Richard Farnes’s every nuancing didn't take flight from Hunding’s living-room floor.These are the imponderables of large-scale Wagner performance. Experience a slight disappointment in one act, and you may hit the roof of heaven in the next. As happened here the instant we saw Robert Hayward’s Wotan intoxicated by the battle-might of his favourite valkyrie daughter, and Kelly Cae Hogan’s Brünnhilde championing at the bit. Very well, so those war-cry “Hoiotoho”s are never a marker of how the rest of her role will proceed, and those treacherous top Bs were under par. But after that Hogan never gave us a false note or gesture, pouring forth musical and dramatic generosity without any forcing.Hayward (pictured below) was a powerful but unrefined Wotan in Phyllida Lloyd’s ENO Ring. Glastonburyites may remember him with amazement when Act Three hit the festival, a reminder that the Ring has long been “for the people”. He is now one of the greats, focused and physically relaxed enough not to need to do too much dramatically to let us know of the chief god’s exultation and deepest despair.We were back to the crystal-clear dialectics of Das Rheingold with the return of Yvonne Howard’s adamantine Fricka, pointing out the law of marriage-customs in as gripping a husband-wife scene as I’ve ever experienced. Then the long narrative of what has brought Wotan to the point of wishing for “the end” was riveting – and if a bass-baritone can pull that off, you have no fear of him lasting through to the end, where having encircled his beloved daughter with a ring of fire Hayward's god signed off with an exultant final high E. Magnificent and deeply moving.There were fine things from the doomed sibling lovers in the second act, too, Weinius turning a golden screw in the great “Annunciation of Death” scene where his ever more intense questioning leads Siegmund to a refusal to follow Brünnhilde to Valhalla if it means leaving behind the woman he loves so much. And I wonder if the impact of 10 distinctive female voices as Brünnhilde and Sieglinde follow the Valkyries’ ride of the unrelentingly emotional last act with the urgent fallout from Siegmund’s death can ever have been more thrilling, with so much delivered direct to us.Transfigured from beauty-goddess Freia to bad girl Gerhilde, Giselle Allen led the way – another singer who tells you everything you need to know about a character from the off – while the most amazing high notes of the evening came from Valkyrie 2 in the ensemble, Katherine Broderick, and there was clarion lower-register underpinning from Madeleine Shaw's Rossweise. A rightly climactic apostrophe from Bisset’s grateful hero-bearing mortal to Brünnhilde’s cosmic generosity was followed by an equally astonishing ensemble as the protective valkyrie sisters protect the soon-to-be-outcast Brünnhilde: when have you ever heard a septet of competing lines sound so bel canto?And the end, arguably the most moving in all opera (though the last-minute redemption of Jenůfa runs it close), crowned the work as Brünnhilde (Hogan pictured above) improvises bright ideas to stop her total humiliation by the furious but desperately loving Wotan. Physical contact in this out-front semi-staging is minimal, but when Wotan blew the kiss to put his daughter to sleep, passed it over her face and Hogan’s head dropped, it was hard not to let tearfulness spill out into a sob. And Farnes’s calm authority reached its zenith in the shape of the flames and the emotion of the “Magic Fire Music”, as fine a slice of deep-level Wagnerian conducting as you’re ever likely to hear, with none of the grandiosity or choppiness of comparatively overrated Barenboim. Whatever happens as we meet a new hero and a different Wotan/Wanderer in Siegfried, thankfully Hogan will be there until the end of the world. This Walküre, at least in its second and third acts, will go down in the history books among the very greatest.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/die-walkure-opera-north-southbank-centre,4
201,"Das Rheingold, Opera North, Southbank Centre",Das Rheingold,Opera North,2016-06-29,David Nice,"They promised Wagner for everybody at the Southbank Centre, and so far they're delivering. Community events cluster around a livescreening of each Ring instalment in the Clore Ballroom. We privileged few in the Festival Hall wondered how newcomers might be reacting out there, but there was no interval in the two-and-three-quarter-hour Das Rheingold to go and test the waters. I'm hoping that Tolkein lovers enjoyed the mythological gimmicks of the tetralogy's ""preliminary evening"" opera even if it offers the driest speech-song and the least knock-out impact of the four in terms of human emotion.One thing's for certain: there could have been no clearer delivery of the drama and the issues than Opera North's ""concert staging"" with its clever projections by the director, Peter Mumford. Helpful texts for first-timers, certainly, but sometimes too much background: hardcore Wagnerians might have been irritated by the past-tense summaries on the screen telling us what was going to happen, and in some cases what had happened, when Wagner's stage directions might have done just as well.There was information overload at the start, certainly, when we just need to experience the orchestra rising from the depths of the Rhine – rippling surface only on the screen not quite right – and to trust to the narrative of Rhinemaidens guarding the gold versus dwarf Alberich deciding to grab it once repulsed in his advances. But after that so many of the effects got it just right: the descent from mountain top to Nibelheim via a sulphurous cleft in the rock and back again, the dark nature background for Erda's apocalyptic warning, and of course the final rainbow bridge which has nothing to do with Saturday's glorious Pride and homes in on the word of the week – delusion. Mumford wisely lets it fade to black pessimism on the screenA strong if not entirely A-list cast of singing actors had a more difficult task on a narrow runway in front of the orchestra. The Proms Ring cycle conducted by Barenboim worked so well because the luxury of a full stage allowed singers already experienced in working with each other to relate; here, they were forced to express themselves mostly out-front, stinting a bit on the personenregie. One felt that each had brought his or her own dramatic style and gestures along rather than working as one.So while Wagner the anti-capitalist revolutionary of the 1840s described all-too-corruptible chief god Wotan as ""the sum of the intelligence of the present"" – and that would seem to be our own present still – the sum of the intelligence of last night was unquestionably Loge the demi-god who stands apart from the rest in the riveting physical and vocal performance of Glyndebourne favourite Wolfgang Ablinger-Sperrhacke (pictured above). Entering with flickering fire-fingers, he settled into the role of intellectual political advisor who gets the gold back from Alberich but then sees events spiral out of control and finally moves back to detachment. The pause before a highly original inflection of ""who knows what I'll do"" at the end was endemic of this man's performing genius. He's not just a character tenor, either; on this evidence we need him in Schubert Lieder much more than several of our over-promoted native choral-scholar weeds.Top of their respective games, too, and welcome in Wagner anywhere in the world were the undervalued Yvonne Howard's poised, calculating Fricka and Giselle Allen, surely a Sieglinde in the making, acting her heart out, but never too much, as youth-and-beauty goddess Freia (both pictured above). Freia is distressingly ransomed to the mafia Fasolt and Fafner of James Creswell and Mats Almgren (I'd have given them black rather than red ties and breast-pocket handkerchiefs so Loge could have worn orange, but the colour brought off a singular coup as Alberich's curse claimed the first of its victims).Cresswell (pictured below with fellow giant Mats Almgren on the left) would have made a more rock-solid Wotan than Michael Druiett, though this more humane of the two giants could have done with a bit more tenderness invoking Freia in the only real love music of Rheingold. Druiett gave us a Wotan somewhat past his prime, which perhaps matters less in Rheingold than Walküre, where we're getting Robert Hayward tonight (not sure that will work either, but let's see). To judge from the last-minute throat catch, he may have been ailing. (UPDATE: Mr Druiett informs us he was singing with tonsillitis; so he did heroically under the circumstances. An announcement should have been made.)Also stretched to the limit, but pulling it off, was Jo Pohlheim's Alberich. In the first scene he played a funny, characterful and even rather cuddly dwarf to Rhinemaidens who sounded more like Valkyrie or Norns, not quite aqueous enough, but more blackness in the voice might have made us hate or fear him more than we did as master of Nibelheim, and bully to brother Mime (Richard Roberts, touching, but may be over-parted in Siegfried, when we need Ablinger-Sperrhacke to take over the role). The curse, though, was terrific and the voice held out thrillingly. There was a disappointing Erda, not nearly steady or pitch-firm enough, from Ceri Williams, but Mark Le Brocq and Andrew Foster-Williams delivered the goods as the ineffectual minor gods.What carried the evening above all was the sumptuous but never indulgent interpretation of Richard Farnes; if we have to lose Mark Wigglesworth at English National Opera –  and as in the political world, the fight's not over yet – Farnes would be the man for the MD post. He creates a similar depth of sound in Wagner to Wigglesworth, and if the biting violas are more conspicuously fine than the violins, just occasionally smothered by the brass from where I was sitting, the whole is a miracle of passion and precision. No nodal point missed its mark, special effects – including the 11 anvillists to left and right of the platform – were perfectly judged, and the final illusory pomp driven home almost frighteningly in sound and vision. Excitement is running high for the real human stuff which begins with Die Walküre tonight.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/das-rheingold-opera-north-southbank-centre,4
202,"Le Nozze di Figaro, Longborough Festival Opera",Le Nozze di Figaro,Longborough Festival Opera,2016-06-27,stephen Walsh,"“It doesn’t need me,” Sebastian Thomas writes in this season’s Longborough programme, “to labour the idea that the content of a theatrical or musical piece should find some relevance to our own lives.” No, indeed. Practically every director one could name labours it already, sometimes with very odd results.For some reason, the 1950s are a current favourite touchstone of relevance. So it’s a mild relief that Thomas Guthrie has chosen to locate his new production of The Marriage of Figaro at the start of the First World War, like some binned episode of Downton Abbey. Count Almaviva appears during the overture dressed for the grouse moors; Cherubino marches off to the trenches in a tin hat, and Susanna is an Edwardian ladies’ maid in blouse, skirt and apron.What all this tells us about Mozart and da Ponte that their own setting doesn’t escapes me, but it looks nice and works well in Rhiannon Newman Brown’s clever, cut-out sets, including empty door-frames in Act 2 that reveal the Count approaching his wife’s bedroom while she is (almost) canoodling Cherubino, and Susanna in the Countess’s dressing room overhearing the Count’s threats to kill whoever is in there.The whole point of Figaro, of course, is its explosion of the social structures of the so-called Enlightenment, and I suppose you could point to 1914 as a comparable moment of impending breakdown. Figaro himself doesn’t deliver a political tirade in the opera like the one in Beaumarchais’s play, but he does behave in that spirit, and there is a fine, confident insolence about Grant Doyle’s portrait, backed up by superb, genuinely basso quality singing that emphasises, as Mozart surely intended, Figaro’s weightier character compared to the flighty, unscrupulous baritone Count.All the same, it’s a slight irony of Guthrie’s production that it’s almost at its best in the final act, the garden at night, subtly lit by Wayne Dowdeswell, and for once convincing in its tapestry of mistaken identities, but a scene that makes no sense at all in the context of late Edwardian realism, even at that great moment when Figaro shatters the whole 18th-century convention by instantly recognising the disguised Susanna by her voice.In the end with Mozart everything comes down to the quality of characterisation and movement and, obviously, vocal style. Guthrie’s staging has the makings of excellence in all these areas. But at the moment it’s on the slow side and with an element of stand-and-deliver that, to me, suggests some measure of under-rehearsal. Many of the solo numbers are sung to the audience, like arias in a Bach Passion, and there are unresolved awkwardnesses in the action scenes. Why, for instance, in the Act 2 finale doesn’t Susanna simply whisper to Figaro about the note he now needs to own up to, as he’s standing bang next to her? Of course the scene is artificial, but it has an internal logic that calls for correct geography.There is strong casting and some weaker. Benjamin Bevan is a forthright, bullish, shotgun-toting Almaviva, slow moving like a highland stalker, but superbly aggressive in his Act 3 aria. The young Norwegian soprano, Beate Mordal, is a lovely, personable, light-voiced Susanna, nicely contrasted with Susanna Fairbairn’s vocally somewhat darker Countess (pictured right), moving especially in “Dove sono,” the opera’s profound, still centre. Anna Harvey’s tall, gangly Cherubino is not helped by being made to start “Voi che sapete” like a nervy choirboy, but otherwise survives the various gender changes with the vibrant, oversexed image of “Non so più” intact. Harry Nicoll doubles as a mincing Basilio and a twittery Don Curzio, both neat, precise portraits; but Eric Roberts’s sharply drawn Bartolo is at present marred by vocal and verbal inaccuracy, which so far as I could tell his very funny gardener, Antonio, is not.Robert Houssart conducts, stylishly enough but with a certain preference for slow-to-moderato tempi that is reflected in the stage movement or, sometimes, lack of it. He needs, too, to get to grips with matters of ensemble between stage and pit. But the playing itself is bright and well-honed, and the performance is accelerated in the usual ways, by denying Marcellina (Wendy Dawn Thompson) and Basilio their last-act arias and by swingeing cuts to the recitatives. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/le-nozze-di-figaro-longborough-festival-opera,3
203,"Werther, Royal Opera",Werther,Royal Opera,2016-06-25,David Nice,"All 23 of Massenet's mature operas boast memorably melodious quarters of an hour and fastidious orchestration, so why Werther’s special status as a repertoire staple? Three or four great arias may have been enough to clinch it. There’s also the fact that the source, Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther, confers a highbrow status the opera, a pale shadow of the original, doesn't really deserve. At any rate it came over last night as no more than an after-dinner mint to a dark day's dining on scorpions.The chief reason for going to this third revival of Benoît Jacquot‘s under-nuanced production, with its naturalistic and fascinatingly lit sets by Charles Edwards (Act Two pictured below) at odds with the unnaturalistic, out-front acting, is once again the conducting of Royal Opera Music Director Antonio Pappano. He keeps the leisurely first two acts on the move. He also reminds us that Massenet’s introspective moments and the subtle orchestral colours have a lot in common with Elgar, that a wealth of detail has been lavished on some outwardly straightforward situations. But somehow Massenet’s attempts to go deep don’t stick like Elgar’s in a different context. Is that because we don’t sympathise with Werther’s being half in love with easeful death – that in fact we just don’t care about Charlotte’s leading him on?Certainly in Vittorio Grigolo’s Werther and Joyce DiDonato’s Charlotte we have only half the story. Grigolo can sing it all, scaling down the heroics to impressive half-voice when necessary, but his acting is stock Italian-tenor gesturing that would do for at least a dozen roles, at odds with the tortured, introspective young Werther. I doubt whether the staff director responsible for this revival, Andrew Sinclair, could have reined him in. DiDonato is a star presence, brimming with musicality, but the fast vibrato in the voice isn’t under full control, fluctuating between throbbing emotion and a pushing to thinness that sends the voice out of tune in the pressurised third act, a serious case of overparting. Some serious technical problems here need addressing.No one else does a bad job in the supporting roles, yet we don’t really want Heather Engebretson’s perky kid sister Sophie or David Bizic, doing what he can with dull husband Albert’s music, hanging around on stage. The production once again plonks an unhelpful interval after the first act, maybe to accommodate the most striking of the sets, the diagonally-placed terrace outside the Wetzlar church; if you didn’t know that the best music is in the third and fourth acts, you might be tempted to leave after the second. As it is, the plangency of the final suicide scene is unearned by these hapless lovers’ mitherings and ditherings. Give me Cendrillon or even Le roi de Lahore any day.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/werther-royal-opera-0,3
204,"Jenůfa, English National Opera",Jenůfa,English National Opera,2016-06-24,David Nice,"ENO's new artistic director Daniel Kramer must regret having gone on BBC Radio 4's Start the Week to talk about suspending Janáček ""and other obscures"" from the company's repertoire for several seasons to come. Good God, if Jenůfa, Janáček's first searing masterpiece, can't move an ENO novice to tears then something's wrong. I can only repeat what I wrote about the recent concert performance, that I'd always recommend it as the first port of call for anyone who loves theatre and is wary of opera.Fortunately everything is right in this revival of David Alden's industrialised Czech setting, removing the action from 19th-century Moravian village to 1950s factory with flashing lights rather than revolving mill wheel to reflect the fateful xylophone that punctuates the First Act. It takes us through pain and suffering to the possibiity of a better future. That was a trajectory for Referendum Night that could only send the Remainers - surely the majority in the Coliseum - out with more hope than they had when they came in. Something of that still has to exist at the bottom of Pandora's opened box.Colours are breathtaking in a hard-to-balance scoreThat it was the fourth unqualified triumph for Mark Wigglesworth this season suggests that ENO should, under happier circumstances, have been thinking of getting him and Alden to complete a Janáček cycle, not dropping the composer, however temporarily, from the rep. Conductor and director worked together back in 2010 on a Katya Kabanova so stunning in its impact that I went twice. I'd do the same for this.The ever more amazing players of the ENO Orchestra under Wigglesworth capture the best of all possible worlds. There's the sheer dewy beauty that brings them close to the rather soft-grained Czech Philharmonic sound in April's concert Jenůfa; Wigglesworth makes infinite distinction between the quieter dynamics, summed up by his subtly escalating emphasis on the two heart-surging violin phrases launching the final scene. But there's also the sheer,well-earthed power missing from that earlier performance, with curtains to all three acts as electrically charged as Mackerras used to make them.Colours are breathtaking in a hard-to-balance score; the harp figures as much here as its Czech counterpart did on the Festival Hall concert platform, leader Janice Graham's violin solos double the impact of Jenůfa's prayer for her absent child and even the bassoons forge subtle links between Graeme Danby's lecherous Foreman, usually a sympathetic character, and Nicky Spence's Števa as drunken Lothario.All this would be some compensation, but not enough, if the relationship between the two central female characters weren't as powerful as it is. The dynamic needs to shift. Jenůfa starts out as a sweet and sensible village girl in trouble whose weakness is her love for the feckless Števa. Then she becomes more like her stepmother the Kostelnička or village sacristan, whose hard earlier life with a drunken, abusive husband has contributed to her harsh decree that these ill-suited young people shouldn't get married for a year. And here the balance certainly alters, inexorably, devastatingly.Michaela Martens, a mezzo rather than the more usual soprano, does indeed seem a formidable Kostelnička in Act One, but she has such a range of vocal shadings at her disposal that we're shuttlecocked back and forth between emotions like her frightening rages against the father of Jenůfa's child who won't take responsibility and her softening when she responds to Števa's weakness in the face of his fear (Martens and Spence pictured above) and embraces him.At this point it's Jenůfa who is the more severe and damaged soul, her heaviness lightened only by love for the week-old baby. Young Laura Wilde makes a heartrending transition from a spirited, pretty girl in Marian blue to drugged, pale and facially disfigured young mother (pictured below) and on, in Act Three, to a wise woman who's learnt too much too soon about the disappointments and horrors of life. Throughout, her delivery and body language are truthful, her upper register flawlessly radiant. The battle of top sopranoid top notes between the two women in the claustrophobic and decisive Second Act is spine-tingling, as it must be. Very well, so it could have been cast with British singers - Elizabeth Llewellyn and Susan Bullock are two that spring immediately to mind - but we can have nothing but gratitude for the commitment of these two Americans.All this is enriched still further by Peter Hoare, as the passionate factory hand Laca whose jealousy of Jenůfa's love for Števa drives the first act to a charged denouement. Hoare leaves us in no doubt of the febrile, marginalised would-be lover's generous soul from the start, and the drama reaches sob-inducing heights when he barges in on Jenůfa's grief for the child she believes died a natural death. That unbearable pull in the lower half of the orchestra, the confrontation of Laca's ardour with Jenůfa's declaration that she has no love left to give, all this is searing music-drama of the highest order. It's here that an English translation - a presumably modified treatment of the old one by Otakar Kraus and Edward Downes which respects the crucial repetitions of certain lines as later versions have not - makes all the clearer the remarkable directness of Jenůfa's language. Wigglesworth's trust in the power of dramatic silences provides a further turn of the screw.Alden, whose first act focuses on more negative emotions than are perhaps there in the music and the original setting, keeps the truth of the relationships in Act Two strong and simple, enhanced by the large space of Charles Edwards' urban Eastern European apartment with its dirty, broken windows behind the cardboard covering the Kostelnička has applied to keep her stepdaughter's shame from the world and the powerful changes of Adam Silverman's lighting. He even finds unusual humour in the Act Three wedding preparations, the nuptial folk chorus delightfully done by girls in traditional costume, staying true to the customs persisting behind the Iron Curtain (shades of the late, great Nikolaus Lehnhoff's half-folksy, half 20th-century-realistic Glyndebourne Bartered Bride; pictured below).That only makes the discovery of the baby's corpse beneath the ice and its consequences all the more shattering. Like Lehnhoff in his classic Jenůfa, one of the all-time great productions, Alden makes the violence of the community's reaction terrifyingly palpable, and the ENO Chorus rise to the challenge with focused intensity. Then it's left to Martens, Hoare and Wilde to carry blazing torches to that ever-surprising ending. We can believe that, as happens in the daring original playwright Gabriela Preissová's novelistic sequel to her remarkable play, the Kostelnička could be rehabilitated after her prison sentence in the now-happy family of Jenůfa and Laca. That's an unusual possibility in an Alden production, but here, at least, he knows how to serve the source's greatness of heart.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/jenufa-english-national-opera,5
205,"Idomeneo, Garsington Opera",Idomeneo,Garsington Opera,2016-06-23,David Nice,"Natural disaster, in the shape of a metaphorical sea-monster ravaging classical Crete, might make a director's imagination work overtime on Mozart's first, jagged masterpiece. Alas, only unnatural disasters have been inflicted upon us in productions at Glyndebourne, ENO and the Royal Opera, with singers going some way to make amends. Now, at last, the green and pleasant valley of the Wormsley Estate has given birth to a clear and sober staging by Tim Albery that gives both the human beauties and the inhuman surrounding phenomena of the score their due. A near-perfect cast that can sing and act in equal measure does it fullest justice and honours Mozart's teeming invention at every twist and turn.There is orchestral authority, too, from conductor Tobias Ringborg in the very first bars, with dotted rhythms tense and commanding before a swing into a lightning-flash seascape. Some tempi can seem too fast and unyielding for the singers - Elettra's Act One aria especially - and rather romantic changes of gear can seem contrived. There might also be a little more melting pity amid the terror of the third act stretch where King Idomeneo gives in to implacable Neptune and prepares to sacrifice his beloved son Idamante (pictured below).Ringborg does emphasise the through-composition of the drama, amazing for 1781, but the cuts as we head for unavoidable sacrifice are a mixed blessing. Minor character Arbace (Timothy Robinson in urgent form) gets his vivid recitative but not his arias, the gap where the second should be tumbling us into a crisis - with a third tenor, the luxury casting of Robert Murray in the small role of High Priest - that affects everyone; strings are splendidly severe here. Once divine intervention has averted the crisis, though - and Nicholas Masters was the real bass article as a not-so-distant Voice of Neptune - it's a pity not to have Idomeneo's blissful ""Torna la pace"", where the action can afford to slacken at last. I dont mind missing the supplementary ballet, which has played a major role in stagings from Schaaf's 26 years ago (the only other good one I've seen) to Kušej's (the worst of Regietheater). Mozart's ballet music is consummate, but it's hard to see how it would fit with the rigour of this particular concept.We do, though, need the king's final aria as a crowning glory for Toby Spence's magnificently tortured protagonist. A slight forcing in the very early stages of the first act, shared by several of the other singers, gives way to a terrible intensity, and a recognition of long-unseen son Idamante (world-class mezzo Caitlin Hulcup, convincingly boyish), mingled with realisation that the boy must be the sacrifice to Nepture, that's rightly crucial, even if Mozart doesn't give it much space The big set-piece, ""Fuor del mar"", gets the best deal since the heyday of Anthony Rolfe-Johnson - it was a decorative stretch too far for Philip Langridge, whose natural successor this tenor now turns out to be - and Spence engages both baritonal timbre and true tenorial upper-register ring in it without any obvious gear-changes.Interaction is all. Just as we're left in no doubt of the awfulness whereby a son must be sacrificed, we're also plunged right at the beginning into realising what it is for a daughter to have lost her father, as Louise Alder's Trojan princess Ilia (pictured right) outlines forcefully to the man who seems to show a paternal concern for her. She's the fairest of the 18th century protagonists trapped on an alien contemporary shore; Hannah Clark's designs allocate her one of two packing cases as a well-equipped refuge, while out of the second come exhausted Trojans and into it go corpses in body-bags in Act Three, which made my neighbours titter but which seemed to me a perfectly-judged image of the horror. The interior of the crate is neat and clean, a refuge closed to her after the disaster. Maybe there's a bit too much opening and closing of the doors, too much donning of the paternal coat, and later a reverse undress for Idomeneo which doesn't go anywhere, but Albery doesn't err for the most part.Economical but direct in every expressive gesture, radiant in lyric-soprano delivery, Alder - who's already one of the finest singers of the new generation - melts our hearts as she arranges peonies in a vase to match the woodwind's bucolic strains in ""Se il padre perdei"", where it's subtly suggested that Spence's Idomeneo may have fallen in love with her himself.Nor is Rebecca von Lipinski's Elettra (pictured below in Act One), lovesick for Ilia's beloved Idamante, a cartoon harpy who veers into kittenishness when she thinks she's getting her heart's desire. Lipinski subtly and even humourously suggests the character's insecurity as well as her vengefulness. If she's too pushed by Ringborg in ""Tutti nel cor vi sento"", where she turns potential tragedy into being all about her, the Act Two idyll finds this Elettra miraculously transforming into a foolish-fond Mozart heroine of the warmest hue.The final mad scene gets the works; others on stage feel as much pity for this Elettra's torments as we do. Woodwind contributions, winsomely clear throughout - they're to the front, left of the conductor, in the pit - provide an especially startling contribution in the high oboe that pecks away at Elettra's liver in this number, sounding like an especially demented ring-tone.Add to the mix the lustrous Hulcup as Idamante, a mezzo Idamante who's already succeeding as Strauss's Octavian around the world, and you're in for the best sung performance of Mozart's first great ensemble, the stricken Act Three Quartet, that may ever have been heard in an opera house: voices are perfectly blended, the action tellingly set across the rift that's opened up in the wooden stage since the devastation. Crowning it all is the young and shattering chorus, superbly trained by the excellent Susanna Stranders, contributing in a way that their counterparts at ENO won't get to do in their entire 2016-17 season (and you have to ask why ENO isn't using British-based singers anything like as extensively as they do here). Meanwhile, in the last three or four years Garsington has reached the standards of Glyndebourne at its best, and there's no higher compliment than that.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/idomeneo-garsington-opera-0,4
206,"Don Giovanni, Classical Opera, Page, Cadogan Hall",Don Giovanni,Classical Opera,2016-06-18,Gavin Dixon,"Mozart operas on period instruments – it’s hardly a new idea, but it’s still the exception rather than the rule. The 18th–century sound has a lot to offer in Don Giovanni, as Ian Page and his Classical Opera Company demonstrated this evening. Clear string tone and vibrant woodwind colours were the order of the day. There was plenty of drama too, with Page expertly pacing the narrative and drawing an impressive and often robust tone from his modest forces. He also assembled a fine cast, no superstars here but rather a well-balanced and well-integrated ensemble. The result was a compelling reading, and a concert performance that never felt lacking in drama for want of staging.The period instrument sound was most arresting in the overture, with the opening chords all attack and buzz. Reedy bassoons and shallow timpani predominated, these the edgy sounds that modern strings usually smooth. As the first act got under way, the orchestral tone became rounder, though no more conventional, allowing Page to apply weight to the climaxes. This, combined with his excellent sense of pacing, led to some real impact at the conclusions to each of the acts. The wooden floor of Cadogan Hall even vibrated in sympathy with the bass through the act I finale, a rare occurrence in the period performance world.Page assembled an impressive cast, mostly young but all convincing in their roles. At the heart of the ensemble was the pairing of Jacques Imbrailo (pictured above) as the Don and David Soar as Leporello. Imbrailo is a little light of tone, and he sometimes lacks menace – he’s always more seductive than sinister, but he dominates the stage, despite his small frame. He has a beautiful tone as well, and excellent diction. Soar has a more robust bass, but it is similarly smooth and lyrical. Although this was unstaged, the two acted together throughout, and the interaction, physical and musical, always felt natural. Soar was a late addition to the cast (replacing an indisposed Darren Jeffrey), so much of this was probably spontaneous. Three excellent singers in the female lead roles: Ellie Laugharne has a direct, pure tone as Zerlina, Helen Sherman brings fine coloratura to the role of Donna Elvira, and Ana Maria Labin has a dark, complex vocal colour as Donna Anna – perfect casting all round in other words. David Shipley’s Commendatore and Stuart Jackson’s Don Ottavio were both serviceable, though neither stood out. Bradley Travis (pictured below, with Ellie Laugharne), on the other hand, was an excellent Masetto, with distinctive tone and plenty of projection. A frustratingly small role for such a promising voice.Microphones were set up to record the concert, no doubt for a future release in Classical Opera’s Mozart series on the Signum label. The opera was performed in its original Prague version of 1787, and while no artistic rationale was offered for using this shorter score, it may have been to ensure it squeezes onto two CDs. But no matter, the recording promises to be special. The live experience felt impressively dramatic and narrative, and primarily though how these qualities were conveyed through the music. The rich and diverse colours of the orchestra should also transfer well to audio recording. Don Giovanni is hardly a stranger to disc, but this one should definitely be worth hearing.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/don-giovanni-classical-opera-page-cadogan-hall,4
207,"Be With Me Now, Britten Studio, Snape",Be With Me Now,Britten Studio,2016-06-16,David Nice,"As the hand-held credits popped up on screen to pianist and musical director Manoj Kamps's superb quartet arrangement of Mozart's Magic Flute Overture, the European Union's Culture Programme logo brought a spontaneous burst of applause. Not the norm for Suffolk this week, I'm told, but this audience knew how international opera is, how we're all connected in Europe's musical world.A year and a half after its inception as a collaboration between the Aix-en-Provence Festival and the European Network of Opera Academies – I was there at the very first meeting but had not seen the show until last night – this operatic adventure, pasticcio, call it what you will, features 11 different nationalities among its creative team and composers of nine countries spanning a period from 1689 to 2015. It ended up last night at the Aldeburgh Festival having visited six other European venues. Be With Me Now ought to be playing in London every night until the referendum, after which one might optimistically hope that the strange and powerfully performed epilogue for five singers and four instrumentalists, Vasco Mendonça's specially-commissioned What the Night Brings (its accompanying action pictured below), might temporarily be replaced by a more jubilant finale.""Stronger together"" is only one of many messages in this layered hybrid. Director Julien Fišera and dramaturg Isabelle Kranabetter have devised a mini quest opera analogous to The Magic Flute, with Mozart's music beginning and ending the personal love-story strain which runs both on screen, in the beautifully composed video work of Jérémie Scheidler and Pascal Poissonnier, and on stage where a group of musicians lose their Tamino (Gwilym Bowen). He walks out on what looks like a recording session for a playful screen rendering of the Serpent's attack and the Three Ladies' rescue in the same style as Complicite's triumphant ENO Flute. From that first gathering in January 2015, I hadn't anticipated how funny parts of this fantasia could be.The camera followers our tenor backstage and into a taxi, and he's off in search of memories of the girl who's just dumped him by text (Rannveig Káradóttir). The remaining artists comment on and counterpoint his journeys to European cities with operatic meditations on love. Katharine Dain and Kinga Borowska play Bellini's Romeo and Juliet to a Verona perumbulation, Borowska bursts into a joyous zarzuela number as our hero watches a dance class in Madrid.Charismatic young Polish baritone Tomasz Kumiega (pictured above) gets increasingly enthusiastic instrumental support for Britten's cabaret song ""Tell me the truth about love"" as Bowen's character finds a photo of his beloved inside a score at Aldeburgh's Red House, and gives a Gerhaher-worthy interpretation of Wolfram's ""O du mein holdes Abendstern"" as the unhappy wanderer curls up in a blanket beneath a Wagner memorial in Munich (a superb held composition, this). It should be noted that, with the apt exception of Verona which simply can't help looking beautiful, none of the European cities gets the rose-tinted Woody Allen view; the video work favours the contemporary and the alienating.There's disconcerting contemporary music, too. Melancholy meltdown by rivers in Brussels and Ghent is inscaped by ""Halt"" from Wolfgang Mitterer's Im Sturm and Dan Janssens' Tristia, the production's second special commission and tele-conducted by the composer from the Belgian water's edge. The elusive heroine's parallel crisis is resolved by Katharine Dain's ""I go to him"" from Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress, a better performance than any I've heard in the opera house, and the agony prolonged by Káradóttir's limpid, unaccompanied Handel ""Piangerò"" as she arrives in the studio, turning to a joyful ""Tamino mein"" as her love comes back to his starting point. The long Mendonça setting is justified by an uncertain future for the relationship, but we all recognise that ""What the Night Brings"" may, next week and in America later in the year, affect us all.Any faults? Only that it could have been a quarter of an hour longer so that we could have heard a bit more from the soprano and tenor lovers; the show could easily take 90 minutes. But spotlighting the singers is not really this perfectly fused piece of music theatre's intent, and its series of contrasts is already fine-tuned. The instrumentalists, it must be added, are just as malleable as the singers and play their instruments in various positions and different parts of the stage; even the piano gets moved around by the performers (pictured above: Ana Filipe Lima, Fanglei Liu, Sébastien Van Kuijk and Manoj Kamps). This is the official end of the tour, but I see no reason why such a fine piece of work, promoting such an important European message, shouldn't be seen in many more theatres – not least the Linbury, when it reopens – around the world.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/be-me-now-britten-studio-snape,4
208,"The Beggar's Opera, University of Birmingham",The Beggar's Opera,University of Birmingham,2016-06-15,Richard Bratby,"Memo to self: never read the director’s programme essay. Jacob Dorrell, director of the University of Birmingham’s summer production of Britten’s The Beggar’s Opera at the Barber Institute, explains: “I wanted to bring to the Barber stage a community of people one would never expect to appear in an opera: today’s working-class community.” Dorrell is a young director, early in his career, so let’s leave aside the fact that his vision of “today’s working-class community” – a world of jeggings, leopard print, trackie bottoms and midriff-baring maternity wear – seems to come out of Coronation Street by way of Little Britain.And let's ignore, too, that “today’s working-class community”, far from being a rarity in opera, featured in recent productions of Sweeney Todd, Moses und Aron and Greek. And that Birmingham’s own internationally-renowned opera company has involved community members of all classes in productions ranging from Otello to Stockhausen’s Mittwoch aus Licht. As I say, Dorrell is young. And he’s far from alone in writing this sort of guff. Ignore it.Because this is actually a smart, resourceful and entertaining student production of what is by any standards a difficult piece to bring off. Its once popular tunes and 18th century in-jokes don’t land on their own any more. A director needs to recreate a world in which the adventures of Polly, Macheath, Lockit and the rest can plausibly occur, and then charge these characters with sufficient raw life to make us care – all this with very little sustained singing. Britten’s 1948 reinvention of John Gay’s 1728 original gets you halfway there; its angular harmonies and grainy, silver and grey orchestrations already suggest an atmosphere of urban seediness. Dorrell runs with it. Ambient industrial noises fill the auditorium pre-show, and the Beggar (Tom McCann) shuffles on through the audience in baseball cap and hoodie, dragging his sleeping bag behind him. Peachum is a small-time entrepreneur and the action takes place entirely amidst the hunched wage slaves of his backstreet sweatshop. There, we meet him (Matt Hayden), together with his wife – played as prime Northern battleaxe by Lydia Jane Haynes – their daughter Polly (the sweet-toned and wide-eyed Lizzie Lister, pictured right with Holly Singlehurst as Lucy), and in time, Gay’s whole Hogarthian carnival of Georgian low-life. Dorrell apparently wanted to “grunge up” the singing; this initially seemed to take the form of Haynes snarling the ends of phrases and Lister swooping up from under the note in TV talent-show style. But that mattered (and actually happened) less and less as the performance progressed, with the cast slipping back into their perfectly attractive natural singing voices – bright (and when required, powerful) in the case of Lucy (Holly Singlehurst, pealing out her high notes in a prosthetic baby bump while pouring bleach into a cocktail blender); eloquent and occasionally raw with indignation for Matthew McConnell as Macheath (easily the most sympathetic character alongside Sam Wilson’s Cockney thug of a Lockit and Daniel Scott’s wheedling Filch). Amongst the minor roles, Daisy Tudor’s Mrs Trapes whirled by in a flurry of pink feathers and chatter. Whoever was responsible for casting has a perceptive eye – and ear. And it all bounded along vigorously, song flowing easily into speech, insults zinging through the air (“You pouting slut!”) and early problems of audibility and balance resolving themselves as the evening progressed, even if some cast members seemed more comfortable with spoken dialogue than others. The brief choral ensembles were alert and clear, and the small orchestra under Johannes David Wolff clearly enjoyed every wry bassoon solo and ominous percussion rumble of Britten’s remarkable score (the harp writing alone is a marvel of shadowy restraint). Dorrell’s final coup de théâtre (spoiler alert: Macheath’s reprieve backfires in macabre style) may have subverted Gay, but it seemed to fit remarkably well with Britten – and the evening as a whole. Given the context and the resources available, this Beggar’s Opera was a substantial achievement. Dorrell has something to say: just ignore his words, and let his theatre do the talking.@RichardBratby",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/beggars-opera-university-birmingham,4
209,"The Iris Murder, Hebrides Ensemble, Edinburgh",The Iris Murder,Hebrides Ensemble,2016-06-14,David Kettle,"It just goes to demonstrate the breadth and ambition of the Hebrides Ensemble’s work. For its 25th anniversary, the Scottish new music group (although its output delves a bit further back in time than that description might suggest) had commissioned a brand new chamber opera from Inverness-born Alasdair Nicolson, unveiled at Glasgow’s Cottier Chamber Project festival, with subsequent performances at Edinburgh’s Traverse Theatre and Orkney’s St Magnus International Festival, where Nicolson is artistic director.To be honest, though, The Iris Murder was a pretty mystifying experience, as elusive as it was allusive – but bewitching nonetheless. To a libretto by New Zealand-born, now UK-based poet John Gallas, and with shades of Gawain-era Birtwistle, it lined up reflections on the passing of the seasons, cycles of life and death, with the strange, allegorical story of one Rawley Beaunes who beheads the lovely Iris in the woods. That’s after lamenting the passing of Daisy, Rose, Lily and others (geddit?), whose graves he also tends. As a result of the murder, he’s summoned before the Green Man and, after a night/winter of bitter regret, forced to pay for his crime the following morning/spring.Nicolson’s magical music, however, fitted the story gloriously – quirky, jerky, it was full of little hocketing cells that bounced back and forth between the players, never quite the same, but managing to lodge themselves firmly in the memory nonetheless. He drew a remarkable range of colours from his quartet of clarinet, cello, accordion and percussion, sometimes acid-hued but always glittering with a febrile light in his nervy textures. The Hebrides players tackled it with vigour and utter conviction, under the gentle sweep of cellist/conductor William Conway’s bow.Despite Nicolson’s evocative score, however, the opera’s pacing was less assured, especially its long stretches of instrumental music, which left the singers sometimes looking rather awkward, as if they hadn’t been given enough to do. That wasn’t helped by Martin Constantine’s somewhat static direction, which emphasised the opera’s ritualistic aspects in its deliberate movements and determinedly non-naturalistic setting, but could have done with simply a bit more happening. Gabriella Slade’s simple set, lit ably by Mark Doubleday, was eerily evocative with its glowing pillars and piles of cinders (pictured above right).Elizabeth Llewellyn stood out as the serene Iris, soaring effortlessly through Nicolson’s grateful vocal lines with a nuanced, rich soprano of ever-changing colours. Christopher Bowen was all nervy energy as anti-hero Rawley Beaunes, with crystal-clear diction and considered meaning behind everything he sang. Andrew Fellows (pictured above left) was vocally indisposed as the Green Man, but appeared on stage anyway, lip-syncing to the singing of Oliver Hunt, drafted in at the last minute to sing from a score at the side of the stage. It was a bizarre but inventive solution to a problem that could have scuppered the whole project, and in fact the disconcertingly disembodied voice only added to the opera’s otherworldly strangeness – and both performers portraying the Green Man turned in very fine performances.Despite its rather disappointingly uneventful staging, The Iris Murder was an exquisite offering, oblique, unsettling but captivating. However, it’s one that probably needs a more assertive sense of drama and activity to bring its delights truly alive.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/iris-murder-hebrides-ensemble-edinburgh,4
210,"The Cunning Little Vixen, Glyndebourne",The Cunning Little Vixen,Glyndebourne,2016-06-13,stephen Walsh,"Is The Cunning Little Vixen a jolly children’s pantomime, or is it a searching study of issues of life and death, Man and Nature? The answer, naturally, is that it’s both. Children dress up as animals, and sing and prance about. But at the same time grown-ups (both animal and human) dream and fantasize, couple and procreate, hunt and kill. Remarkably, it’s a tragedy that leaves no bitter taste. The heroine dies, but Nature goes on. The hardest thing to understand about hunters is that they identify with and even love their prey. But this is precisely the crux of Melly Still’s brilliant Glyndebourne production of Janáček’s masterpiece, revived after four years, and still as fresh as the forest in which it’s set.Other productions have drawn attention to the work’s menopausal aspect, the way its central human character, the Forester, sees the renewal of life in the forest as a mirror of his own fading sexuality. But Still makes no bones about the work’s physicality as such. Although, as David Nice observed in his review of the production when it was new, not everything in this intricate fancy-dress display is entirely clear, one thing is very plain, and that is the sensuality of the human characters’ relation to the natural world.The Forester (Christopher Purves, or his double) embraces the Vixen; the long love duet between the Fox (Alžběta Poláčková) and the Vixen (Elena Tsallagova) that (nearly) ends the second act is delivered with a passionate physicality that would hardly be out of place in Act II of Tristan. We’re many a mile here from the cartoon strip that was Janáček’s source. This is adult drama in anthropomorphic dress, superbly committed under conductor Jakub Hrůša, and with a string of memorable vignettes from individuals too numerous to list.It remains, nevertheless, an enchanting spectacle in its own right, designed with unfailing wit, colour and inventiveness by Tom Pye (the sets), Dinah Collin (the costumes), and Paule Constable (the lighting). Pye and Collin achieve unforgettable effects with a backcloth that looks like a kind of vertical Cresta Run up and down which the animals clamber and tumble, and with a gnarled central tree out of which creatures drop like spiders on strands of cobweb and under which the badger (Alexander Vassiliev) lives in his sett until evicted by Tsallagova’s ineffably self-assured Vixen.Costume after costume says something witty and essential about its wearer, from the vain and arrogant foxes with their portable brushes to the mosquito (Colin Judson), who bites the Forester with a safety-pin proboscis. Similarly the dances that are such a feature of the score (by choreographer Mike Ashcroft) have all the buzz and tumult of hot summer afternoons in the wild wood. This is one of the few operas that give director and designer licence to invent without risk of subversion, and here they take it with relish.Hrůša’s reading is from the start robust; the delicacy, he is telling us, is there in the score and needs no special underlining. Above all, it’s a performance that moves, in both senses, with energy and emotional intensity. The orchestral playing (by the London Philharmonic) would be impossible to better. And the central performances are perfection: Tsallagova irresistible as the Vixen Sharpears, sexy and nubile, vocally seductive; Purves (pictured above), a Forester no better than he should be in human company but in the forest a thinker and feeler, profoundly touching in his final soliloquy about the rolling seasons; Poláčková a fine, eloquent Fox; Judson a village schoolmaster to the life (as well as the Badger, one of two or three doublings authorized by Janáček and taken on this occasion).Janáček was 70, and in love with a much younger woman, when The Cunning Little Vixen was staged in Prague in 1924. He surely saw himself in it and earthed his emotions through it. And perhaps this, in the end, is the source of its secret charge, so beautifully tapped in this revival.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/cunning-little-vixen-glyndebourne,5
211,"La Bohème, Opera Holland Park",La Bohème,Opera Holland Park,2016-06-12,alexandra Coghlan,"Boy meets girl; girl and boy fall in love; boy loses girl. In true bohemian fashion, La bohème can lay its operatic head anywhere from Paris to Peshawar, in any era from 90s punk to the Belle Epoque, and still make sense. What matters are the emotions; do we believe in the relationship between Rodolfo and Mimi, the camaraderie between Rodolfo and his friends? Stephen Barlow’s new production for Opera Holland Park may relocate the action rather unexpectedly, but what emerges both fresh and familiar is a love story between two people who couldn’t care less what city or what age they find themselves in – they only see each other.Bucking a trend for contemporary bohèmes, Barlow instead looks back in time for his setting, alighting on the 16th century. If it’s a shock to see farthingales instead of flares, a tavern in place of the Café Momus, then it’s one that quickly subsides, and a context that makes sense of so many of the opera’s smaller details – that business with the candles, the hand-to-mouth artistic existence, the lack of medical intervention.But setting aside, Barlow plays things very straight indeed. This is a production that puts opera before director, as solidly handsome as Andrew D Edwards’s sets, and infinitely revivable (are you listening, ENO?). If it lacks that indefinable alchemical something that transforms excellent into outstanding then it’s a small lack, especially given the vocal quality on show.Because it’s really all about the voices here. Soprano Anna Patalong makes a delicious Mimì. There are no sharp edges on a voice that pours itself generously into every phrase, and a lovely darkness to the tone colouring that suit her unusually sober, serious heroine. There’s little of the glibly flirtatious in her interactions with Shaun Dixon’s Rodolfo (pictured above with Patalong), and the candle scene is all innocence, rather than a knowing seduction routine. Dixon too, though temporally wayward, occasionally surging forwards or pulling back without warning, has proper Italianate vocal swagger and no little brilliance. Just occasionally a little pushed, and taking some time to settle initially, his is a voice that still feels under construction, but what a thing it’s going to be when complete.Barlow’s light-touch direction could do with being a little more interventionist with the young bohemians. Their horseplay is so decorous as to be barely believable, and we miss the comedy of the Benoit episode (though David Wolozko makes much of the physical comedy of his character). Coupled with some smaller voices (Frederick Long’s Schaunard especially) the whole feels a little under-projected, both dramatically and vocally. The pay-off is the final scene, where sudden tenderness and restraint feels less jarring than it would against a more rambunctious opening.Apart from some 16th-century style “special effects” (I shan’t spoil the surprise), the opera’s comedy is largely relocated to Elin Pritchard’s larger-than-life Musetta and her relationship with Marcello (beautifully sung by Andrew Finden). Theatricality meets stolid good nature here, and it’s a dynamic that makes a marvel of the Momus episode, crowned with an extrovert “Quando m’en vo”, and helps soften the latter sparring.Matthew Waldren conducts an account that’s brisk rather than indulgent, occasionally weighting the orchestra a little too heavily in the balance with the stage. On opening night there was some instrumental scrappiness, which doubtless will settle as the run progresses. The OHP Chorus sing superbly for him – further proof that this year’s line-up is an exceptionally strong one.This bohème is definitely the crowd-pleaser it was designed to be – a necessary piece of romantic consolation after the bitterness and brutality of Iris. The latter production will stay longer in the memory, but it’s the former that will stay in repertoire.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-boh%C3%A8me-opera-holland-park,4
212,"Illuminations, Tynan, Aurora Orchestra, Collon, Snape Maltings",Illuminations,Tynan,2016-06-11,Helen Wallace,"Nothing galvanises an audience quite like physical risk. As soprano Sarah Tynan rose on a hoop into the darkness, intoning the final words of ""Départ"" from Britten's song cycle Les Illuminations, you could almost hear her heart race. Beneath, a troupe of circus performers held the rope – and her life – in their hands.In choreographer/director Struan Leslie’s vision, performers decked out as Rimbaud’s ""sturdy rogues"" brought sinew, grace and heart-stopping spectacle to a night illuminated by explosive, raw-fresh string music: it was all about the vertical.For Leslie, Rimbaud’s Les Illuminations belong to dream and desire: in a set designed by Gary McCann, lit by Chris Davey, Tynan (pictured right with acrobats) lay in a precariously balanced bed atop a wardrobe, a bedroom where furniture had elongated into skyscrapers, as if seen through a distorting mirror. Beneath her the Aurora Orchestra’s strings subtly shifted and regrouped for different pieces, like a ""shoal of shining fish"" in conductor Nick Collon’s phrase. Circus performers inhabited the air between on trapeze, hoop and straps, at one point hovering over the sleeping Tynan to lift her from the bed in an airborne erotic caress of mesmerising tenderness.Les Illuminations itself was the culmination of a musical sequence interfused with the spirit of young Britten. His early, all too easily overlooked masterpiece Young Apollo made a jubilant opener, its crazed orgy of scales (ably given by John Reid) complemented by the dizzy twizzling of an acrobat in a high hoop, rather better than the tame hat trick which began it. French poetry unlocked the teenage Britten’s lyric gift, and Debussy’s String Quartet, with its tragic, sensual mystery belonged here. Richard Tognetti’s arrangement for string orchestra threatens at times to drown its lithe arabesques in a sumptuous sheen, but he wisely reduces forces to quartet for the Andantino: an intensity of focus was found by a single performer here, just as the strain of the first violin’s octaves were wonderfully matched in two gymnasts mirroring movement on trapeze.Not all the choreography captured the delicate precision of Debussy’s score, reminding us that this was not dance, and couldn’t mesh or synch with the music’s trajectories, especially noticeable at the ends of pieces.  Adams’s Shaker Loops shares its zinging effervescence with Britten’s early works, and it was a neat trick for two performers to swing gradually out of phase above the strings. But it couldn’t be sustained or developed, and in the end it was the seven players tearing through this high-velocity score with blistering abandon that proved the more compelling sight.Perhaps the most extraordinary moment of the evening came with Britten’s five-minute Reveille (1937). Over a repeated rotation of chords on piano, a violinist literally plays acrobat, while a single, female trapeze artist performed a poignant journey, from trembling fear to airborne mastery, as she wound herself up a double cloud like a human spider, minute calculations of weight, timing and balance, music constructed in air.Tynan ""awoke"" at Les Illuminations' heraldic fanfares, filling the hall with a burning luminescence to relate her dreams. Here, the physical theatre was more literal: ""Villes"" was a boiling mass of human limbs; a sensual, furry-thighed Pan crept around her in ""Antique"". Most memorable was the glittering silver creature of ""Being Beauteous"" who appeared to levitate, balancing on one hand, with Rimbaud’s ""arms of crystal"". Intoxicating stuff: little wonder a double-bassist, instrument in hand, couldn’t resist grabbing one of the staps and whirling into the air.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/illuminations-tynan-aurora-orchestra-collon-snape-maltings,4
213,"Tristan and Isolde, English National Opera",Tristan and Isolde,English National Opera,2016-06-10,David Nice,"""Bad Star Trek episodes"" is how one director describes a certain unfortunate look in would-be intergalactic opera productions. The late Nikolaus Lehnhoff came perilously close to it in his Glyndebourne Tristan und Isolde but offered a coherent vision. Daniel Kramer, now ENO's Artistic Director, has a few ""bad Star Trek episodes"" and many good ideas that don't always join up or else outstay their welcome. Unevennness abounds: hideous costumes and makeup clash with Anish Kapoor's eventually brilliant designs, singing and conducting are only patchily inspired.Let's celebrate the best first. Stuart Skelton's Tristan is the finest account of Wagner's most extreme and taxing operatic character - Brünnhilde and Wotan notwithstanding - that I've ever seen or heard on a stage (the ultimate assumption, Jon Vickers', was just before my time). He runs the gamut of sound from tenderness and near-extinction on a deathbed from which he can't or won't be released to full Heldentenor pelt in expectation of Isolde's arrival and even a dangerous but apt supra-singerly edge for the extremes of the endgame.Two other singers amaze. The most extraordinary colours of the evening belong to Karen Cargill's servant Brangäne (pictured above with Melton), sounding instrumental in her Act Two nightwatch; she may be a mezzo, but she could be an Isolde in the making, though best that she first sings Berlioz's Dido, this Wagnerian heroine's true predecessor, as Robin Ticciati wants her to (and ideally at Glyndebourne, with Skelton as Aeneas, please). Matthew Rose shakes the foundations as ""betrayed"" King Mark.It's all the more remarkable that Cargill and Rose triumph given unfortunate get-up and some of the evening's worst concepts. Dramatically, you can see why Kramer wantedBrangäne and Kurwenal to be mincing courtiers - she with brillo-pad Marge Simpson hair, he as Jacobean fop, at odds with his butch music - but their constant campery and fussing over dressing up their mistress and master detract from some key narrative in Act One. Would a newcomer, for instance, pay proper attention to Tristan and Isolde's back story as delivered by the wrathful heroine? And why arraign the lovers for their meeting, only to undress them before the King's arrival?In Act Two, a greybeard Mark - no reason why he should be this old, since he's only the teenage Tristan's uncle -  comes on lovers not in flagrante delicto but in the throes of death. It's hard enough at the best of times to feel sympathy for a king who's contracted a marriage of convenience, but for this one to make it all about himself when the wife and friend he's supposed to revere may expire at any moment is an absurdity only Rose's incredibly sympathetic forcefulness can cast aside. (Pictured above, Rose with Cargill, Skelton and Melton)Even so, Kramer's idea of the preceding ""Night of Love"" as an extended episode of suicidal self-harming isn't a bad one; it's no more confused than Wagner's appropriation of Schopenhauer's supposed transcendence over life's wheel of will and desire to his own bizarre notion that the lovers can actually be united on whatever the other side might be. Kapoor's giant moon-as-half-eaten cheese certainly adds to the hypnotic slow-motion horror of the scene, and the claylike substance makes a strong reappearance connected to the flow of dark blood from Tristan's unquenchable wound in Act Three. If only the First Act had co-operated in the whole. The deconstructed wooden pyramid with its three ""rooms"" (pictured below) should at least allow the singers to be visible in all parts of the theatre since they're at the front of the stage, but reports from the side were that one voice was magnified at the expense of another.If those spectators were getting more of Heidi Melton's Isolde than Skelton's Tristan, they should not have been too disconcerted. Melton has a warm and lovely middle range, and she's good with the text, though the acting is limited to much rolling of eyes. She can certainly just about manage Isolde now, but she won't be singing anything in five years' time if she persists with the role; this is a voice better suited to Wagner's Elsa and Elisabeth - which she sang beautifully in the Proms Tannhäuser three years ago. The top is effortful in two of the three passages of what Richard Strauss called ""erotic screaming"", and she only just makes the end of the Liebestod (or ""Transfiguration through Love"" as it truly becomes here - I won't spoil Kramer's last idea, one of his best).Melton doesn't always get the help she needs from Edward Gardner in the pit. After his perfectly flowing Mastersingers last season, he seemed less certain of pace here, indulging too many slow tempi when the action needs to move forward. The Prelude's steady kindling was fine: towards the climax I could swear the Coliseum's gold-inflected 2004 dropcloth was levitating long before it actually did. But Isolde's narrative loses energy, and last night Melton was stretched too far by the crucial phrase in which she tells Brangäne how the wounded Tristan in Ireland looked into her eyes as she was about to kill him.The string sound is rich, but the players don't quite burn for their former music director. There's another dip in tension before the crucial potion taking, too, though not before the heart of the Act Two love duet, thanks to a whopping cut (Kramer and Gardner need to trust Wagner and their audience). The point of repose doesn't quite flow or glow as it did under Pappano in the intelligent and consistent Christof Loy production at the Royal Opera, surely the best of recent years.Act Three works best thanks mostly to Skelton's resilience in bloody extremes (pictured above), though I pity Craig Colclough, the vocally stalwart Kurwenal, having to jabber around as a scabby old Feste or Fool (point taken in what Kramer has clearly read is more Beckett nullity than Shakespearean raging). At the denouement Frieder Weiss's video projection - stunning when it works properly - goes berserk and the awkward follow-spots of Paul Anderson's erratic lighting give way to a flickering mess; thankfully the last tableau is static. Never dull, sometimes annoying, at best - if only fitfully - electrifying, the end result does let Wagner shine through. And three stars in his universe would be four and a half in any other.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/tristan-and-isolde-english-national-opera-0,3
214,"Tannhäuser, Longborough Festival Opera",Tannhäuser,Longborough Festival Opera,2016-06-10,stephen Walsh,"Wagner was never satisfied with Tannhäuser, and it’s not hard to see why. Essentially a study of the tension between sensual and spiritual love, it was composed at a time when, by his own later confession, he lacked the resources to deal properly (that is, improperly) with the sensual element, and even in any profundity – one might feel – with the spiritual. The piece went through numerous revisions, extensions, compressions, tinkerings of one sort or another. But what was left is a patchwork of early and late, conventional and inspired, and a sometimes painfully naïve morality which tends to leave you sorry for Wagner’s sex-fiend Venus and aggravated by her spiritual opposite number, the pure Elisabeth.It looks like, and sometimes is, a director’s (hence an audience’s) nightmare. In Bayreuth, where I last saw it, it was set in a biogas recycling plant, Venus gave birth to the baby Jesus, watched over by Elisabeth as the Virgin Mary, and the reassuring message was apparently that profane and spiritual love are really much of a muchness.At Longborough, to his credit, Alan Privett rejects any such evasion, though his slant on the Venus-Elisabeth axis is to say the least oblique. Venus, in his Victorianisation of Wagner’s medieval Thuringia, is an overgrown Alice on a swing, while Elisabeth is a twitching neurotic who has evidently been abused as a child by her uncle, the Landgrave. Leaving aside any possible implication that child molestation might offer us moral alternatives, the reading has a certain bizarre logic. On a stage where extreme Venusberg cavortings would be a shade cramped, it makes sense to see Venus as Tannhäuser’s middle-class bit on the side, and no less sense to find some edge to Elisabeth’s repressed purity and the ridiculous straitlacedness of the troubadours.Privett’s Venus, the unusually (for a Wagner soprano) shapely Alison Kettlewell (pictured above), slips into the reading with precision, moving well, with just a flicker of vulgarity, and singing with fine, warm tone and admirable flexibility of expression for a character whose emotional tactics are, frankly, those of a bored housewife. His Elisabeth, Erika Mädi Jones, provides a marvellously interesting portrait of troubled repression, musically as well as visually. Her brilliant “Dich, teure Halle” on her first appearance (superbly accompanied under conductor Anthony Negus) shows an excitability that can quickly turn to revulsion at all the troubadours’ talk of high-minded love. Even the suggestion that she give out the prizes sets her cowering. Is her unexplained death suicide? We aren’t told, but might suspect.The problem for both sopranos is the Tannhäuser himself, John Treleaven (pictured below), who cuts a shambling, unheroic figure in an ill-fitting green suit and forces his tone unnecessarily in this small, not very Wagnerian theatre (whether Neal Cooper, the second Tannhäuser – see above – will shamble, or force, remains to be seen). We get him initially front of curtain during the overture, in an extended dumb show as the composer composing and his wife (Venus, oddly) trying in vain to hand him a letter which turns out, presumably, to be from a lover (Elisabeth?). Why do good directors waste their energy on such stuff? It tells us nothing we need to know, and distracts from the music.For the rest, the staging is crisp and compelling. Act II, with a lively young chorus and a strong team of suited troubadours, is as gripping as I’ve ever seen it, and an endorsement of Wagner’s early grasp of theatre even before his music was wholly up to the task. Hrólfur Saemundsson is a good, stylish Wolfram, not too interesting, just right; Donald Thomson a slightly growly Landgrave, which suits the character’s implied dodgy past; and Chiara Vinci a delightful, eye-catching shepherd boy, smartly directed.I also like Privett’s use of the auditorium for the pilgrims’ processions. Kjell Torriset’s designs are functional, not more, with some mysterious details, like a ladder to heaven that nobody uses and a large thurible swinging out excitingly over the audience, but no sign of the green shoots that betoken Tannhäuser’s supposed redemption. The real hero, though, is Negus himself, who inspires everyone to heights of musical excellence and seems able to lighten Wagner to the point where it sounds like music rather than indoctrination. I’ve heard more consistently polished wind playing in this theatre, but have not heard anywhere a Tannhäuser I’ve enjoyed so much.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/tannh%C3%A4user-longborough-festival-opera,4
215,"Into the Woods, Opera North, West Yorkshire Playhouse",Into the Woods,Opera North,2016-06-09,graham Rickson,"Opera North’s ongoing Ring isn’t taking up much of the chorus’s time, which presumably is one of the reasons that many of its members have decamped half a mile east to collaborate with the West Yorkshire Playhouse in an eye-popping new staging of Sondheim’s Into The Woods. That opera companies can and should stage Sondheim is vindicated by this production: the musical values are superb, my only niggle being that James Holmes’s excellent pit players are hidden offstage. The tricksy ensemble numbers are dazzling, with every word and melodic line thrillingly clear.James Brining sets the opening in an intricately realised primary school classroom, accurate down to the reading book bags and wall display of “I wish…” statements tacked to the walls. Which serves to remind us that Sondheim’s edgy fairytales are nominally the stuff of childhood, and hinting at a safety-obsessed culture oversensitive to the dangers of leaving the school building without multiple risk assessments: Nicholas Butterfield’s Narrator is an affably assertive teacher directing a troupe of pupils clad in hi-vis jackets.The room is swept away as the plot unfolds, leaving only two sets of child-sized tables and chairs onstage. The birds which Gillene Butterfield’s Cinderella (pictured above) summons are represented by flapping school exercise books, with Milky White the cow fashioned from assorted milk cartons. Sets of playground swings descend later, the perfect vehicles for Warren Gillespie and Ross McInroy’s princes to deliver a sharply witty “Agony” in Act 1.Colin Richmond’s elaborate set designs make brilliant use of the Playhouse’s technical resources, but you suspect that this work would still succeed in a stripped-down staging with piano accompaniment. James Lapine’s elegant book is an ideal match for Sondheim’s score, so it’s a pity that some of his lines are delivered in such hammy fashion in the long first half’s opening scenes.Presumably this is a nod to many of the characters’ pantomimic associations, though many of the jokes fall flat as a result. The grisly dispatch of David Llewellyn’s oily wolf should be blackly comic, but Brining turns it into crude farce.And then, unexpectedly, the staging finds its feet, the pace slowing a little and the characters given space to breathe. Claire Pascoe’s Witch (pictured above with Amy Freston's Rapunzel) is a genuinely scary stage presence, and the evolving relationship between Dean Robinson and Louise Collett as the Baker and his Wife is beautifully characterised (pictured below). Nicholas Watt’s Jack is annoyingly goofy at first, but calms down and wises up. A host of smaller parts are well handled, particularly Gordon D Shaw’s obsequious Steward.Newcomers to the work may be discombobulated by the abrupt change of mood in Act 2. The Giant’s Wife is the stuff of nightmares here, Ben Harrison’s sound design giving her assaults a visceral impact. “Agony”’s blackly funny reprise brings the house down, and the Prince’s slimy seduction of the Baker’s Wife is a moment to savour. “Your Fault”, Sondheim’s matchless G&S pastiche, is taken at a real lick but never feels rushed.I’d forgotten quite how affecting the ending of this piece is, the surviving characters realising through bitter experience that it’s best to be careful what you wish for. Grand stuff, my few reservations aside – and how refreshing to see a multi-generational, ethnically diverse audience lapping the work up with a relish that you probably wouldn’t see if this production had been mounted at the Grand Theatre.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/woods-opera-north-west-yorkshire-playhouse,4
216,"Iris, Opera Holland Park",Iris,Opera Holland Park,2016-06-08,David Nice,"""Better than Puccini,"" raved one Tweeter after the final rehearsal of Opera Holland Park's season-opener. Nonsense: ""nearly as good as Puccini"" is the best any of his Italian contemporaries could hope for; that applies to Leoncavallo and the Cilea of Adriana Lecouvreur. Mascagni is more arthritic in his sense of movement – think of how long the plot of Cavalleria Rusticana takes to get going – and sometimes strives hard for those orchestral effects which seem so natural in Puccini. But Iris is at least half-interesting, unlike an OHP stinker, Zandonai's Francesca da Rimini, and it's honourably done.""Honourably"" means, from director Olivia Fuchs's perspective, tackling head-on the distasteful plot in which a girl young enough still to be playing with dollies is drugged and carted off by a Japanese version of the Duke of Mantua to the red-light district and subjected to various degradations before being thrown out with the rubbish. It's the woman-as-victim theme in opera relentlessly applied, all the worse since Iris lacks the backbone of Puccini's Cio-Cio San (Iris was premiered in 1898; Madama Butterfly followed in 1904). Fuchs's designer, Soutra Gilmour, substitutes bars for paper screens in the three cubes on stage, and Fuchs has the women trapped in them throughout the horrible Second Act, with just a measure of revenge on the three ghastly principal men by putting them behind the bars as figments of the dying, degraded but at least liberated Iris's imagination in Act Three.Fuchs's staging of Iris's terrified encounters with playboy Osaka, who's put on a puppet show (shame there weren't really puppets) in Act One to try and seduce her, is unrelenting, and Anne Sophie Duprels (pictured right) is totally convincing as a childlike creature fluttering around painfully to escape what she knows is going to be wrong. Duprels's tone can spread at the top – she's spent many years now singing heavy lirico spinto roles – and in the first act she sang under the note, but the voice was fully engaged by the time of the big conflict, and few sopranos capable of singing the role would go to such physical extremes.The trouble is that Mascagni shows no musical signs of telling us what a shit Osaka is – Puccini, of course, had consul Sharpless on hand to comment on Pinkerton's behaviour, and at least there was a man who might have thought himself in love as well as lust on his ""wedding"" night – and revels in the slightly amorphous Italian warmth of his florid language to try and force himself upon poor Iris. So there's a very uncomfortable disjunction between action and song. Fuchs really has no option, but then defuses the nastiness by having Noah Stewart take his shirt off, at which point the Italian girls behind me starting clucking over his pecs. Stewart is very definitely the genuine tenor article, but unrefined and lucky not to crack in his Act One serenade; there's still work on technique to be done.Act Two's climax, at least, is genuinely upsetting, the male brothel visitors howling over Iris as window-dressing. Here and at both ends of the opera (the apotheosis pictured above), the splendid OHP Chorus sings magnificently. Mascagni's slightly overblown hymns to the sun, with the one tune that may bore itself into your brain by virtue of repetition, go at full pelt, with a combination of drive and grandeur from conductor Stuart Stratford. Not all the players sounded at their best yesterday – the first horn was having a bad night – but the more refined of the textures, the jet-black lower string passages and the whole-tone weirdness at the opening of Act Three, followed up by an evocative Rag-Pickers' chorus, really made their mark.In passages such as this, Mascagni promises so much that he never quite delivers; the pathos and sentiment that seem to emerge so naturally in Puccini are often unmerited, so it's never quite moving. We can't, for instance, be expected to feel any sympathy for Iris's blind old father, resonantly sung by Mikhail Svetlov; he, James Cleverton as the pimp-villain Kyoto and Johane Ansell's Geisha are the most rock-solid voices on stage. But it's really Duprels's acting and the massed OHP forces which carry the evening – and note that there's more for the chorus to do here than in the whole of ENO's cruelly truncated 2016-17 season. In that respect, Opera Holland Park has the balance right.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/iris-opera-holland-park,3
217,"Der Freischütz, OAE, Elder, RFH",Der Freischütz,OAE,2016-06-08,Gavin Dixon,"The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment is 30 years old, and last night it celebrated in style. The orchestra has a long association with the music of Weber, who became iconic of their pioneering work in presenting 19th-century repertoire on period instruments. His greatest work received an impressive performance last night, one that demonstrated the many virtues of their unique approach to the work of the Romantics. But it wasn’t all a success, and was let down by a surprisingly modest staging concept from the usually ambitious David Pountney.The music of the opera is framed by Pountney in a series of narrations, presented by John Tomlinson in the guise of the Hermit. The text paraphrases both the stage directions and the dialogue usually spoken by the singers. On occasion he has to resort to dialogue being read out by Tomlinson while the singers mime, as in the confrontation between Max and Agathe in Act Two, but generally, the Hermit-cum-narrator maintains his authority over the actions he describes. Unfortunately, Tomlinson never really got into the role. The dramatic conceit was that he, as the hermit, was writing out the tale at his lectern, while he was clearly reading it, and often unsteadily. Tomlinson never lacks for charisma or stage presence, but it seemed that Pountney relied too much on these when more dramatic impetus was required. Tomlinson, however, more than redeemed himself with his sung contributions, first as Samiel in the Wolf’s Glen scene and then in the Hermit part proper in the finale, where his still-commanding voice easily dominated an ensemble made up of singers many decades his junior.The remainder of the cast was never less than serviceable, with a few real standout performances. The best of these was Simon Bailey (pictured left) as Kaspar. The dark tone of his voice is ideal for the part, and although he has a tendency to ham up the menacing stage presence, especially the evil laugh, it all served to inject sorely needed drama to the proceedings. The Wolf’s Glen scene was the highlight of the performance, partly because Pountney finally found a way to make his minimalist conception deliver, but also because it was dominated by Bailey’s Kaspar and Tomlinson’s Samiel. Rachel Willis-Sørenson (pictured below, by Trevor Goldstein) was just as convincing as Agathe, bringing real star quality to the big arias at the start of the second and third acts. She has an indulgent vibrato, one that none of the violinists in the OAE would ever get away with, but otherwise the purity and sheer beauty of her tone are ideal for the role.Christopher Ventris didn’t impress to the same extent as Max. He looks and sounds old for the role, and sometimes struggles in the upper register. Further down the cast, there were uninspiring vocal performances too from Wyn Pencarreg as Kuno and William Dazeley as Ottokar, both often overpowered by the modest string ensemble, and in the finale overshadowed by Tomlinson. An impressive Ännchen, though, from Sarah Tynan, who gave an unfussy and elegant account, and a musically strong Bridesmaids Chorus was provided by singers from the Royal Academy of Music.Mark Elder ensured the performance had plenty of drive and energy. He’s a natural choice here, a long-time collaborator with the orchestra and one of the most versatile opera conductors working today. He has the all-too-rare ability to engage with singers who are standing behind him, and to integrate every aspect of the performance without any feeling of over-control. The London Philharmonic Choir were generally on good form, their ensemble sometimes a little loose, as in the, admittedly complex, music of the shooting competition, but coming together admirably for the finale.Best of all, though, was the orchestra, whose performance dominated the evening. Weber’s instrumental writing is always imaginative, and he has a real ear for unusual colours and textures. The period brass was typically raspy, but absolutely ideal in the Wolf’s Glen, where the dark trombone tone defined the mood. Good ensemble and balance from the strings, with particularly impressive clarity in the mid-register, the violas and cellos coming though with fascinating lines that are often missed. And the woodwind section was excellent throughout. Weber finds moments for each of the principals to shine, and that they did, particularly clarinettist Anthony Pay and flautist Lisa Beznosiuk. A mixed evening then, but one that achieved its aim, to showcase the always impressive skills of this distinctive orchestra in its anniversary year.@saquabote",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/der-freisch%C3%BCtz-oae-elder-rfh,3
218,"La Fanciulla del West, Grange Park Opera",La Fanciulla del West,Grange Park Opera,2016-06-05,stephen Walsh,"Though composed after and based on a play by the same author, Puccini’s spaghetti western is in no way a sequel to Madama Butterfly, his whisky-sour eastern. Fanciulla is Butterfly’s opposite in almost every respect, and to tell the truth it isn’t much at home in a small theatre like the one at Grange Park. Where Butterfly is delicate and light-handed, its successor is loud and punch-drunk. Its heroine is no frail Puccini victim but a tough mother figure surprised by true love. Simpering geishas are replaced by rough gold-diggers, and mawkish tragedy by the unlikeliest of happy endings.Stephen Medcalf’s eight-year-old production, revived by Peter Relton, captures something of the work’s roughness and emotional crudity, but is often defeated by its episodic, stop-start discourse. Fanciulla is longer and more drawn-out than the best Puccini, and the seams aren’t always that well concealed. Its first quarter-hour or so of scene-setting, though some of the best music, could be sliced out without much damage to the plot. But this is also one of the best bits of the production, the various minor characters sharply drawn, finely sung, and smartly directed.Maybe it’s partly Puccini’s fault that the actual drama works so fitfully. The relationship between the bar-owner Minnie (Clare Rutter) and the disguised bandit Dick Johnson (Lorenzo Decaro), and everything to do with his unmasking, near-lynching and final rescue by Minnie herself (on a horse, according to Puccini’s super-elaborate stage directions, and with a pistol between her teeth), is so implausible that the production is sometimes reduced to presenting it more or less openly as a concert for soprano and tenor with the odd baritone intervention. At the end, with Minnie and Johnson riding off into the sunset waved goodbye by the miners who were just now hanging him from a tree, even these directors take refuge in parody, with the departing (horseless) lovers outlined against a huge, lurid rising sun while the weeping miners resume their homesick chorus from the first act.This is, at any rate, a staging that for the most part respects Puccini’s clear mental picture of what his work is all about. The designer, Francis O’Connor, gives us a believable gold-rush bar, albeit with rather well-dressed miners, and a clever divided set for Minnie’s hut, which then slides away to leave us with the winter forest ready for the lynching. Snow falls, perhaps rather too obviously on cue. It’s really quite like old times, and none the worse for that, in a work of so obviously a genre character.Musically, the star of the show is Decaro (pictured right), a tenor previously unknown to me, but a fine, uninhibited performer who blows into Minnie’s bar like the wind that later menaces her hut. One sometimes feels he needs La Scala to give due space to his ringing tones, but it’s a problem one can live with. Rutter is somewhat upstaged by her lover: a nice, stylish performer, but without the vivid stage presence that would go with her commanding position in the lives of these otherwise womanless outcasts. More interesting is Stephen Gadd’s portrait of the ambivalent figure of the sheriff, Jack Rance, driven to villainy by thwarted love, and certainly no instinctive Iago. His “Minnie, dalla mia casa” in the first act, about his loveless childhood, is touchingly, warmly sung.For the rest, this is a company show, with excellent individual contributions too numerous to list. Especially notable: Jihoon Kim’s deep-voiced Ashby (the Wells Fargo agent), Hanna-Liisa Kirchin’s touching vignette of the squaw Wowkle, Michel de Souza’s sonorous Sonora, and Thomas Humphreys’s brief glory as the camp minstrel Jake Wallace. Stephen Barlow conducts the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra tidily, if with big moments that sometimes swamp both stage and auditorium. But then Puccini wrote it that way, and for once his soft touch is largely absent.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-fanciulla-del-west-grange-park-opera,3
219,"Ariane/Alexandre Bis, Guildhall School",Ariane/Alexandre Bis,Guildhall School,2016-06-01,David Nice,"Common wisdom has it that the prolific output of 20th century Czech genius Bohuslav Martinů is very uneven, a judgment surely made without a complete hearing. Some listeners shrink from his fidgety polystylism. Many of us on the fringes of the Martinů hardcore, though, have found ourselves giddy with each new discovery of music we didn't know before: last year, string duos on a CD from viola-player Maxim Rysanov, this year piano trios from the Czech label Supraphon and now two one-act operas, this time live from Guildhall students.Before voicing any reservations, it has to be spelled out that no-one else is doing this kind of work at such a high level across the board (the sung French, for instance, speaks of excellent language coaching). A great deal of thought has gone into concept and casting. Both Ariane from 1958, a psychoanalytic take on a myth we may not recognise in this version and composed in Martinů's rareified, often simpler late style the year before he died, and Alexandre bis of 1937, a bedroom farce with a typically peculiar twist, play with the concept of doubles. In Ariane Theseus in slaying the Minotaur – no labyrinth, no golden thread – kills part of himself; Alexandre is a bourgeois husband twice over, once as bearded patrician portrait and the second time in clean-shaven ""disguise"" as his American cousin, a trifling twist on the plot of Cosi fan tutte.The casting clearly plays to the Guildhall's greatest strengths among its students at the moment, both prizewinners: Josep-Ramon Olivé, the perfect Mozart/Handel baritone, as Thesée and Alexandre bis, and Milan Siljanov – he's been singing bass roles but I hear in this rich voice the ideal Verdi baritone – as the Minotaur and portrait Alexandre (pictured above with Olivé's shaven husband, Bianca Andrew's maid, Elizabeth Karani's wife). The two productions, in Simon Corder's clever designs and lighting, don't look anything like each other, but given that the psychological ties are already there, they don't need to.Director Rodula Gaitanou gives us her own take on the news that Martinů, shortly before his death, listened over and over to recordings of Maria Callas, and based the role of Ariane on her, though she never sang the role; vocal wear and tear might already have made it difficult. Gaitanou sets the whole of this first of the evening's operas in the Salle Wagram studio where Callas recorded Carmen in 1965. Shades here, perhaps, of Christof Loy's Salzburg Die Frau ohne Schatten, where the characters appear in 1950s casual wear for something like Karl Böhm's Vienna recording. But Gaitanou's Ariane offers another, more subtle Straussian link: the singers can mess around in the studio, providing some light relief, as well as taking their roles seriously – the backstage Prologue and mythic opera of Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos deftly interwoven.Parallels with Callas's own sense of desertion aren't too overdone. The only problem is that while Nicola Said is brilliantly made up to look like La Divina (pictured right with Olivé as Thesée), she's an altogether lighter lyric soprano, managing the bigger phrases but sometimes at the cost of squeezing the voice. The men dominate, though the final ""Lamento d'Arianna"", essentially ending where Strauss and Hofmannsthal begin, has a haunting rondo refrain and makes a deliberately weird contrast to the brittle neoclassical music around it. The text from the original play by Georges Neveux, whose Julietta or The Key to Dreams furnished Martinů with his greatest operatic masterpiece, begs more questions than it answers. but this mise-en-scène keeps it light.Alexandre bis almost outstays its welcome, saved by the symmetries of the outer scenes and the surreal, dream vein that Martinů does so brilliantly giving a bit of substance in the central fantasy. Victoria Newlyn's choreography for devils in tuxes and tutus is deftly done, Siljanov is amusing as the complacent portrait Alexander while more light sopranos, Bianca Andrew and Elizabeth Karani last night, act well. Timothy Redmond makes the orchestra sound as professional and idiomatic as you could wish; chamber ensemble strings make some ravishing sounds, though it's hardly surprising if the woodwind are stumped by some of Martinů's more florid burbling. Still, what a delight to hear the idiom so easily done. The evening doesn't add up to anything like the experience of Julietta, let alone Enescu's Oedipe, the current rarity everyone has to see, but then it never tries to. Catch it during its short run, for you probably won't get another chance.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/arianealexandre-bis-guildhall-school,4
220,"Cavalleria Rusticana, Pagliacci, Welsh National Opera",Cavalleria Rusticana,Pagliacci,2016-05-27,stephen Walsh,"Seventy years ago, almost to the month, Welsh National Opera took to the stage for the first time with a double bill of the terrible twins, Cavalleria rusticana and Pagliacci; and fifty years later the company celebrated with the same two works directed by Elijah Moshinsky, designed by Michael Yeargan. To repeat the exercise in the same productions after another twenty years might seem an egregious piece of navel-gazing. But Moshinsky made a clever point with his 1996 staging, about stylistic distances travelled and technical standards raised. And since that same point is if anything even more germane to opera now – and not only in Cardiff – it turned out to be well worth another look.Moshinsky’s idea, simple enough in all conscience, was to locate Mascagni’s rustic chivalry in a stage Sicily of the purest Forties cardboard, but to do it so observantly and with such fresh intensity that the old-fashioned shone with a new light. The Potemkin sets, the chest-beatings and hair-tearings, the “realism” of choruses that, in Wagner’s memorable phrase, are “scenery that has learnt to march and sing,” the absence of anything that could remotely be called a “concept” – all these energised, rather than ossifying, a work that has survived because of them, not in spite of them.It still needs the best singers, however well fedLeoncavallo’s little masterpiece, which certainly does have a concept (we get it in Tonio’s homily before the curtain, though even this takes on a certain ironic focus in the light of his behaviour later on), was acted out on an empty stage, with a highly mobile choreography, a battered lorry for the commedia, “modern” – at least not 1890s – costume, and a Calabria that could be anywhere on the map.Of course, Pagliacci isn’t exactly The Ring, though the score borrows from it often enough; isn’t intellectually open-ended, isn’t exactly intellectual at all. It still needs the best singers, however well fed, with a certain skill in making overacting look right, and these days WNO can supply these things in a way that I suspect they couldn’t have done in their amateur days of the forties and fifties.In fact, this revival (by Sarah Crisp) shows that strong casting can even make Cavalleria rusticana act out like at least minor Verdi. When I first saw the piece at Sadler’s Wells in 1963, with the monumental (in every sense) Rita Hunter as Santuzza, I admired the voice but hated the character, with her endless, pointless moaning about her obviously worthless ex-lover.Camilla Roberts draws one into the character in quite a different way, with a warm presence and richly coloured tone – the best singing I’ve heard from this stylish performer. Gwyn Hughes Jones is a brilliant, uninhibited Turiddu, convincing in his shameless self-justifications, but even momentarily touching in his acceptance of Alfio’s (David Kempster’s) accusations. In fact the whole performance, with excellent support from Anne-Marie Owens (Santuzza in 1996, here Mamma Lucia) and Rebecca Afonwy-Jones (Lola), proves unusually coherent for a work normally regarded as the inferior partner in the bill.Pagliacci gets a somewhat lighter touch. I at first had the feeling that Hughes Jones (pictured above trying to knife Meeta Raval) was holding back as Canio; it’s a tough doubling, after all. But the distinction in colour, the slight thinning of tone, was surely deliberate – different place, time, personality. And there was no compression in “Vesti la giubba” or in the transformation from grease-paint to blood-lust in the commedia. Kempster, a fine, elderly-looking Alfio in Cav, limps around malevolently as Tonio, his leg in a brace, other parts of the anatomy evidently fully operational. But Moshinsky imposes no sex as such, as his 2016 equivalent would surely do. Meeta Raval, a lively-voiced Nedda, gets her leg stroked, and that’s about it. How very 1990s! Gyula Nagy is a vigorous, personable Silvio, Trystan Llŷr Griffiths a smart, noticeable Beppe.Both these operas are big on chorus, which is no doubt why they were chosen in 1946, and is certainly why they still do well on this much bigger stage. Whether standing and delivering in Cav or rushing around eagerly in Pag, the WNO chorus is top drawer, genuinely the best. The orchestra too. Carlo Rizzi conducts, as one would expect, with a fine feeling for the pace and varied density of these two quintessentially Italian works, now, like him, Welsh by adoption.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/cavalleria-rusticana-pagliacci-welsh-national-opera,4
221,"4.48 Psychosis, Royal Opera, Lyric Hammersmith",4.48 Psychosis,Royal Opera,2016-05-25,alexandra Coghlan,"New operas are a risky business, or so the Royal Opera’s past experience teaches us. For years, visiting the company’s Linbury Studio Theatre was like rolling the dice while on a losing streak: vain, desperate hope followed inevitably by disappointment. Glare, The Virtues of Things, Clemency, the failed experiment that was OperaShots. But recently things have taken a turn. Gradually, thanks to works from Birtwistle, Haas and more, the risk has begun to pay off. Now Philip Venables’s 4.48 Psychosis – the first opera to emerge from the Royal Opera’s joint Composer-in-Residence doctorate with the Guildhall School of Music & Drama – gives the company its first truly home-grown hit.Sarah Kane’s final work (first staged at the Royal Court in 2000, over a year after the author’s suicide) is art stripped of its aesthetic shell. 4.48 Psychosis has no characters, no setting, no stage direction beyond frequent silences. It’s a play only in so far as it is written by a playwright, performed on a stage. It’s this very indeterminacy, this fluidity that makes this urgent meditation on love, depression and death so natural a vehicle for someone else’s art. What Kane gives us is naked emotion; what Venables does is clothe it in music.Like a dramatic Waste Land, 4.48 is a collection of fragments – characters, conversations, vignettes, moments – shored against ruin. Picking his way through the chattering textual landscape with infinite care and understanding, cutting little text and adding none, Venables groups the material into genres. The structure that emerges is something like a sketch show; musical and dramatic tropes or textures return again and again, gaining weight and significance cumulatively through repetition and juxtaposition.Conversations between the central character and her doctor, for example, are rendered – in a brilliant bit of musical inspiration – by percussion. Text appears, projected in Ted Huffman’s production onto the white walls of the set, and is “spoken” rhythmically by pairs of untuned percussion characters – a bass drum and a side drum, for example. The effect of these wordless exchanges is gloriously bathetic. There’s whimsy here but also sharper-edged wit, as when the drum punches out Kane’s dry retort to criticism of an over-elaborate suicide plan: “It couldn’t possibly be misconstrued as a cry for help.”Other recurring textures include the use of pre-recorded elevator muzak (musical punctuation between episodes), and a frenetic Glass-esque chuntering of wind instruments to accompany a numeric visual motif. Set against these fixed musical landmarks, stand-alone episodes make far greater impact. An exquisite aria for Clare Presland, sung over a synthesised accompaniment, is equal parts Purcell and pop song, a musical memory that offers a sustained moment of stillness, refusing to give way to the assault of other words and sounds.A cast of six female singers – sopranos Jennifer Davis, Susanna Hurrell and Gweneth-Ann Rand, and mezzos Emily Edmonds, Clare Presland and Lucy Schaufer – share Kane’s fractured text among themselves, with the help of pre-recorded speech and the musical interventions of CHROMA, conducted here by Richard Baker. Venables’s orchestration (light on strings, heavy on saxophones and keyboards textures) is spare but telling, cultivating a mechanistic quality even when combining purely acoustic instruments that refuses to sentimentalise the outpourings of Kane’s speakers. Paired with the heady, giddy texture of so many upper voices, the result feels dangerously unanchored, unmoored from bass certainty and support.With so much of the drama taking place either in music or text (projected or spoken), Huffman’s job as a director is largely to keep out of the way. This he does efficiently enough, treating his cast variously as split personalities of a single self and also as outside individuals – doctors, friends, possibly even lovers. Rand (pictured left) provides the central self, her physical vulnerability at odds with her vocal control, while each of the other singers takes it in turns to dominate, to voice a specific set of concerns or preoccupations.A final ensemble brings all voices together as lapping waves of sound – a rare moment of musical calm, that hints at a redemption, or at least a peace, that the text cannot find for itself. It’s a moment in which ownership of this drama seems to change hands, passing from written word to musical sound, from Kane to Venables.@AlexaCoghlan",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/448-psychosis-royal-opera-lyric-hammersmith,4
222,"Oedipe, Royal Opera",Oedipe,Royal Opera,2016-05-24,David Nice,"""Unjustly neglected masterpiece"" is a cliché of musical criticism, and usually an exaggeration. Romanian master Enescu's vast journey through aspects of the Oedipus myth seemed like an unacknowledged great among 20th century operas through the medium of the starrily-cast EMI recording with José van Dam as the noblest Greek of all; after Martinu's Julietta and Szymanowski's King Roger, here was the last titan to be properly served by a top UK production. Following two acts of La Fura dels Baus's monumental if sometimes skewed take last night, doubts had set in, but by the end, it did indeed seem like a transcendent work of genius, with extra blessings raining down.There's a big story to be told here: not just that of Sophocles’ Oedipus Tyrannus, as in Stravinsky’s opera-oratorio, but its unfortunate protagonist as the subject of the original Sphinx's riddle (""What walks on four legs in the morning, two in the afternoon and three in the evening?""). In Act One, he'd be on all fours if that baby were animatronic. He stands just about upright on two, and then finally on three when Antigone gives her self-blinded father a stick as fellow guide. Àlex Ollé and Valentina Carrasco are hugely ambitious in their approach, wanting the best of all possible worlds: monumental and intimate, timeless and of the present.As the dropcloth rises, you really can't believe your eyes until this frieze on a terracotta surface (pictured above) finally comes to life. But there's the first of several scenic prices to be paid for that coup – no room for dancing, which means a cut of five minutes of some of Enescu's best purely orchestral music (and the first music of the opera to be heard in concert in 1924, 12 years before the long-delayed premiere). In the long and eventful second act, nothing can quite match the visual imagination inherent in the score: I hear a bare, bleached landscape with shepherd's pipings for the scene at the crossroads where Oedipus slays his father, but this is a murky mess of dry ice and night-time roadworks where you can't really see what's going on.The Sphinx is far more scary in her outlandish, near-atonal music than what we see, a wild woman piloting a Second World War plane (pictured right). Enescu and his librettist make a rare departure from their tragic source by having her ask ""What is greater than destiny?"" to which Oedipus replies “Man”, and his adversary dies laughing. It's a terrifically inflected performance from astounding contralto Marie-Nicole Lemieux, in one of at least 10 roles which have a short stage life but need to make their mark.Only one, Alan Oke's Shepherd, doesn't quite make the impact he should. There are two very impressive basses at different ends of their careers, In Sung Sim as Phorbas, the catalyst of the tragedy from Oedipus’ birth city of Thebes, and ever-stentorian John Tomlinson as voice of doom Tiresias. Claudia Huckle has the right warmth for anxious adoptive mother Merope, to whom Oedipus confesses his fears on the Freudian couch, one of several ideas not entirely made clear in the action; you have to read Ollé's programme note for enlightenment. You'd probably get the Xian and the Hungarian toxic mudslide references straight off, though.Sarah Connolly (pictured left with Johan Reuter) laces Jocasta's reproaches with voluptuous terror in a third act which is so different from Stravinsky's Oedipus Rex, the same Sophoclean territory covered more swiftly by Enescu with an unerring sense of ebb and flow. Its denouement is screwed to an unbearable tension in Oedipus's sung-spoken curses and softened by the only voice which can provide balm after an hour and a half of darkness and mystery: the soprano singing Oedipus's daughter Antigone with her melting repetitions of ""Je te suivrai"", perfect casting for Sophie Bevan.The music joins her incandescence in the great epilogue of redemption, essentially Sophocles’s Oedipus at Colonus through the filter of Wagner's Parsifal Act Three (Bevan's Antigone anointing Reuter's Oedipe pictured below), and it’s the melting new idiom here which is the payoff to the horror-movie gestures of earlier acts (“Like a 1940s biblical film score,” said a fellow audience member, and he wasn’t wrong: late romantic music was a huge resource for European composers who emigrated to Hollywood). It’s a pity that Ollé and Carrasco stick with their terracotta theme instead of allowing the scenery to green and follow the musical pastoral. That involves another cut of crucially beautiful invention here, along with the sound of a pre-recorded nightingale. But the mystery of Oedipus’s final merging with the elements is ultimately very strong and moving.This fourth act is Leo Hussain’s finest stretch as a conductor of the hugely complex orchestral writing (surprising that Royal Opera Music Director Antonio Pappano didn’t want this one for himself). There’s plenty of textural clarity throughout, but the Royal Opera Orchestra doesn’t yet capture Enescu’s lurid glow for the more terrible events, and the finale of Act Two, when Thebes welcomes the sphinx-slayer, fails to pack the necessary punch. The chorus provides the right wall of sound when necessary but will hopefully become more precise over the run. Worth noting, all the same, that this is a big work for the chorus, of which there's not a single specimen in ENO's 2016-17 season.You may, like many spectators I overheard at the interval, find the going just a bit too tough in the first two acts and feel like bolting (don't). What keeps the difficult second act especially alive is Johan Reuter’s tireless characterisation of the immense title role, going one stretch further than his magnificent performance in Nielsen's Saul and David in Copenhagen. It needs Wagnerian bass-baritone stamina, and at one point Enescu thought of asking Chaliapin to sing it, though the singer was in his sixties at that point and had to decline.Reuter never falters, though the production robs him of something of his clear-eyed facing up to fate by making him a drunk at the crossroads (yes, you'd drink too if you had that awful knowledge of your fate from Apollo, but that's not really the point of this tragic hero). The climactic Thebes act alone would finish off most singers, but this one has to find new reserves for the final Eleusinian mysteries. Reuter’s Oedipus really does transcend his destiny. It’s a payoff worth waiting for: stick with Enescu, and you may end up wanting to see his strange and various masterpiece again. Catch it while you can.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/oedipe-royal-opera,4
223,"Il Barbiere di Siviglia, Glyndebourne",Il Barbiere di Siviglia,Glyndebourne,2016-05-23,David Nice,"""We're off to Glyndebourne, to see a ra-ther bor-ing op-ra by Rosseeeni,"" quoth songwriting wags Kit and the Widow. So here it was at the Sussex house after a 34-year absence, the most famous of all his operas which includes the overture’s oboe tune to which those words were set, and it wasn't possible that The Barber of Seville, pure champagne, could ever be boring. Or was it? Never underestimate the power of vaguely-conceived direction to rob musical wit and precision of their proper glory.Cast and conductor have been near-perfectly chosen. Enrique Mazzola is a crisp and elegant master of Italian opera buffa at Glyndebourne, his beat clear and high to make sure no-one on stage slips a beat or gets out of synch in those difficult patter ensembles. The London Philharmonic's phrases and the many solos in the Overture - no newcomer for Barbiere, since Rossini had used it twice before - breathe vocal delight, and inner details like the lower string patterns in the big crescendo register beautifully in the wonderful acoustics. Continuo work from fortepianist Andrew Smith and cellist Pei-Jee Ng is deft and wry. The very first soloist on stage, young Huw Montague Rendall from the Glyndebourne Chorus in the comprimario role of Fiorello, shows confidence and warmth; he'll surely make a fine Rossini Figaro very soon.The factotum on this occasion, Björn Bürger, rattles off his famous aria with freshness, elegance and a fearlessness in the difficult range. Maybe he's a bit sexier than his new master, the Count Almaviva of Taylor Stanton (pictured right with guitar-strumming chorus), but the American has the perfect style of the true tenore di grazia in all his florid grace. Add two born comic troupers in Danielle de Niese's Rosina and Alessandro Corbelli, the best buffo alive, as Doctor Bartolo, and what could go wrong?The answer has to be a director, Annabel Arden, who too often seems to have left the singers to their own devices. The start looks promising enough, a pretty balcony scene designed by Joanna Parker to conjure the Moorish element of Seville in a slightly more fantastical way than Christopher Oram for Michael Grandage's far funnier Le nozze di Figaro, returning later in the Glyndebourne season. Chorus and soloists are encouraged to direct a lot of their remarks out front to the audience and - especially - to Mazzola, who rises gamely to the comic interplay; that's all good. There are flamboyant Spanish dance-gestures, eventually overworked, and three actors serve to represent the commedia dell'arte origins of the stock plot.Where does it go from there, though? Flailing gestures and loose business betray a lack of tight direction. De Niese and Corbelli can contort their lovable mugs beguilingly (the two pictured left), but the young master and servant need more help if this Figaro is not to appear smug rather than charming, and this Almaviva genuinely funny in his disguises to get at Bartolo's ward. Even the brilliant Janis Kelly in the cameo role of maid Berta is allowed too much licence, in a costume that's at loggerheads with the rest - period when, exactly? - and a dance routine for her arietta which seemed to delight many in the post-picnic audience but left me stony-faced, well sung though it certainly was (and Kelly gets the high notes in the Act One finale).So when what you see in the ensembles doesn't match up with what you hear, energy can be dissipated. Take the climactic Act Two trio in which Figaro urges the eloping lovers to get on with it - crisp musical fireworks, nothing much going on (and those library steps served no purpose other than to give the singers somewhere to go, for no good reason). The inept staging which accompanies the storm music wasn't nearly as much fun last night as the downpour which burst on unsuspecting picnickers in the long interval.Both act finales were fuzzy, wheeled- or flown-in harpsichords at the end of Act One (pictured below) not a meaningful enough distraction from the messy police-force business. it might have been funny to see Basilio (a cavernous Christophoros Stamboglis) begin spontaneously combusting in his slander number, but the smoke billowing from under the cassock somehow didn't define the conflagration well - and only needed to happen once. A good director doesn't need to keep repeating gags.Mazzola just about freed everyone from this diffusion in Act One, but it was a mistake to turn the Act Two structure pear-shaped with an extra aria for Rosina (I think this was the one supposedly furnished by Rossini for Josephine Mainvielle-Fodor in 1819); better to have had Almaviva's ""Cessa di piu resistere"", too often cut as it was here. It's too late to make us feel genuinely sorry for this adaptable minx in her perplexity at having been seemingly deceived by her ""Lindoro"", and the number wasn't de Niese's finest moment; though she has all the coloratura at her disposal, and stitches an impressive chest voice on to her usual range, support came and went on the first night, with patches of under-the-note singing.Easy enough to forgive that given her stage-animal presence and energy, but on this occasion neither she nor Corbelli, who should have been the real star of the show, had quite enough to work on. So many opportunities with a brilliant cast missed. Let's hope Laurent Pelly can do more with Béatrice et Bénédict, the other new production this season. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/il-barbiere-di-siviglia-glyndebourne,3
224,"Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, Glyndebourne",Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg,Glyndebourne,2016-05-22,alexandra Coghlan,"A celebration of the power of words and music (leaving aside, briefly, that more troubling business about the Fatherland), Wagner’s Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg is a natural opener for the summer opera season. Art triumphs over all, but in David McVicar’s production it’s a triumph of peculiarly human complication – a victory that leaves a hero in tears, that crowns some of opera’s most reactionary stick-in-the-muds with laurels, and leaves us asking: did Eva really pick the right man?It has been well over a year since Richard Jones’s Mastersingers came to English National Opera, but it’s still a production that thrills in the memory, a hard one to move past. But where the brilliance of Jones’s Mastersingers is all about the collective – the massed choric forces of Nuremberg’s citizens, the ranks of Guild members, viewed widescreen – McVicar’s production (first seen in 2011, and revived here for the first time) lives in its close-ups.The quality of the human observation here, the emotion push-me-pull-you between Sachs, Eva, Walther and even Beckmesser is such that even a broadly comic treatment can’t prevent the ending from delivering a gut punch of sudden tragic violence. While McVicar’s direction does its part, it’s Gerald Finley’s Hans Sachs (pictured right) who really carries the emotion of this production. Here is a man whose loneliness is horribly, intrusively evident, whose bitter anger at his loss all but overwhelms him in the opening scene of the final act, but whose affection for Eva is so gentle, so plausible in its gradual onset that we feel genuine uncertainty as to whether he’ll help Walther or woo her himself.The knock-on effects – the subtext of the Cyrano-like prize song episode, the friction between the exuberance of the Midsummer festivities and Sachs’s loss – are telling, and help anchor a production whose trappings and spirit are that of a children’s legend. Updating the setting to post-Napoleonic Germany not only makes political sense of the opera’s nationalism, but also pretties things up nicely. Nuremberg, in Vicki Mortimer’s gorgeous designs, is all shady squares and cool churches, a rounded-up, smoothed-out version of small-town Germany. Apprentices and villagers cavort in Commedia dell'arte too pristine to speak of any serious mischief, and even Beckmesser (Jochen Kupfer) is less buffoonish outcast than awkward loner.Musically again it’s Finley who dominates, calibrating his vocal energy so carefully that it’s only in his final speech that we glimpse the bottom of the tank. Infinitely sensitive in his phrasing, replacing heft with colour and shading, his is a Sachs still more comfortable in this small house than last time, and one it would be a pleasure to see return for a third.Both Michael Schade’s Walther and Amanda Majeski’s Eva (pictured below with Hannah Hipp as Magdalene) present more problems. Majeski’s voice has an inhaled ease to it, blooming with no obvious strain or overwork, but as yet lacks the breadth of tone that a fully-formed Eva needs. Schade, by contrast, has to work hard through the evening, and it shows in jagged, breath-pitted phrases that often dash forwards ahead of the orchestra, and tone that’s far from easy at the top. Tiring audibly through the evening, his was a prize song whose victory was by no means a given.If occasionally blighted by a too-thick spreading of slapstick, Kupfer’s Rowan Atkinson-esque Beckmesser is oddly endearing, aided by some lovely singing and a wiry physical wit. Along with Darren Jeffery’s beautifully sung Kothner, a pert Magdalene from Hanna Hipp and David Portillo’s radiant David, he’s the pick of the supporting cast. The Glyndebourne chorus are good as ever, and after a slightly too matter-of-fact start, the orchestra under Michael Guttler settle into a slightly more generous and flexible momentum.Shunning national politics in favour of personal ones, McVicar’s Meistersinger sits perfectly in Glyndebourne’s small house – a music-drama whose unexpectedly intimate angle refocuses a work with plenty to say about men and women in particular, as well as their collective counterparts.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/die-meistersinger-von-n%C3%BCrnberg-glyndebourne,4
225,"Madam Butterfly, English National Opera",Madam Butterfly,English National Opera,2016-05-17,alexandra Coghlan,"There’s a beautiful moment at the start of Act II of Anthony Minghella’s Madam Butterfly. Butterfly kneels, leaning forward to kiss Pinkerton, seated in his defiantly Western armchair. A paper screen moves swiftly across our view, and almost before it has passed he is gone, just another evanescent vision in this gorgeous, ephemeral world where cherry blossom no sooner flowers than it fades and falls.Now on its sixth revival, Minghella’s production has lost none of its visual appeal. Quick on its feet, thanks to sets that suggest rather than assert, swiftly reconfigured from moonlit grove to marriage bed, it provides both movement and exquisite moments of stillness. The stage pictures – Butterfly’s prostrate body pouring out its streamers of red silk, the silhouetted fan-dance of the start, the lantern-lit seduction – are beautifully judged, Japan as a fetishised, Orientalist fantasy.The production’s curious mixture of straightforward romance and self-aware commentary is summed up in the figure of Sorrow, taken here by a sunken-faced Bunraku puppet, wise beyond its years. On first encounter it’s a gesture that seems too arch, too knowing – substituting the idea of Japan for Japanese innocence itself. But as the revivals have continued it’s one that seems to have grown in power. So delicate are the manipulations of the puppeteers that the little boy (tinier than any real life child who could take the role) lives so completely – walking with tottering charm, tugging at his mother’s sleeve, staring fascinated at swallows – that it’s hard to imagine an actor with more presence.The main musical attraction of this revival is the chance to hear young British tenor David Butt Philip (pictured above right) making his role debut as Pinkerton. If not yet truly Coliseum-sized, the voice is growing swiftly, and promises so much for the future. As it stands, it’s one of the best-sung Pinkertons we’ve heard yet in this production, the voice even and lovely from bottom to top (and what a top it is in this piece) and phrasing consistently sensitive and musical. Add to this some nicely judged acting – his officer might be smugly self-satisfied, but his is the malice of ignorance, not intent – and it’s a fine performance that makes up for what it lacks it Italianate swagger (a fault largely of David Parry’s clipped, emphatically Anglo translation) in English poise.What a shame that neither Butt Philip nor any of his colleagues receive any support from Richard Armstrong’s pit. Heavy-footed conducting tramples the singers underfoot with dynamics that are consistently too loud and speeds that tend to the fast and unyielding. Sarah Tipple’s revival direction doesn’t help, often placing singers back under the proscenium at crucial moments, denying them those extra few metres of forward projection that can make all the difference.A strong supporting cast are led by Stephanie Windsor-Lewis’s full-bodied Suzuki and George von Bergen’s excellent Sharpless, with Matthew Durkan an impassive Yamadori, and only Rena Harms’s Butterfly herself doesn’t quite work. While it’s understandable that ENO might look to America for a Norma or even a Lulu, it seems odd (not to say unbelievable) that they are unable to cast a British Butterfly. If Harms (pictured above left) were outstanding, perhaps this wouldn’t matter, but hers is a voice that, as yet, lacks the full range of colours for the role, tending to the shrill at the top and lacking in warmth. Dramatically, too, it’s a performance that wobbles, veering perilously close to vulgarity at times, lacking the essential innocence that takes Butterfly from cautionary tale to tragic heroine.Minghella’s production is beautiful as ever, but is his Butterfly really Puccini’s? It’s hard to watch his gorgeous flushes of colour, his origami, his fan dances and silk kimonos and not feel that while he’s still in thrall to the smooth, painted face of the geisha, the composer himself is much more interested in the fleshy skin and the messy emotions that lie beneath.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/madam-butterfly-english-national-opera-1,3
226,"In Parenthesis, Welsh National Opera",In Parenthesis,Welsh National Opera,2016-05-14,stephen Walsh,"War may be a dramatic affair for anyone involved in it, but staging it is another matter. In fact describing it satisfactorily at all needs either a Tolstoyan flair for the large canvas, or else a poetic genius for directing its force inwards, into self-reflection or religious contemplation or the kind of intense verbal music, rich in historical and literary allusion, that the great Welsh artist and writer David Jones made his own in his long, tragic prose-poem, In Parenthesis.I can just about imagine an In Parenthesis opera in the form of a one-man show with the author seated on a wooden chair in the middle of an empty stage. To turn it into a narrative opera with a cast of thousands and the occasional nod in the general direction of Jones’s poetic soul, as Iain Bell has done to a commission from WNO, is surely asking for trouble. And trouble duly obliges.The problem starts with the libretto by David Antrobus and Emma Jenkins, one of those patched-up texts that make you feel vaguely uncomfortable if you happen to know the original. The parentheses of Jones’s poem are really its entire reflective substance, flowing from a deeply personal, not to say arcane account of his own experiences as a private in the British army at Mametz Wood. Slipping them in as fragments in a stage action, however ritualised, risks a particular kind of decontextualized obscurity, and a sententiousness completely at odds with the elevated intricacy of Jones’s thinking.Perhaps more damaging is to portray Jones, in the character of John Ball, as a coward, who has to be virtually dragged on to the ship of embarkation to France and shoved screaming up the slope to Mametz. The John Ball of the poem is a self-confessed muddler, a poet after all, tender and unsuited to uniform; but never a coward. His deeper self is here partly transferred to the double act of a male and female chorus, a weary device one had hoped laid to rest by Britten’s Rape of Lucretia. How tiresome these figures are, standing around like grown-ups at a school play, patting the children on the head and occasionally explaining the blooming obvious to the stupid audience.I could go on. But what matters is how Bell manages to transform this material into effective music drama. It’s a mixed, workmanlike achievement, better thought out technically than his overwritten score for A Christmas Carol. The voices have some of the space they (or to be exact, it) lacked there. And there is much lovely individual writing, especially for Ball himself, eloquently sung by the American bel canto tenor Andrew Bidlack (pictured above right), and an exquisite pastoral duet for Ball and his chum Lewis (Marcus Farnsworth), where Bell at last escapes from his tendency to overload the orchestral bass.The big textures that mostly predominate are, I suppose, a natural outcome of the wide-angle approach to the subject. They focus on solid, occasionally brilliant, choruses on a crowded stage peopled, in David Pountney’s production, not only by soldiers but by what the librettists call a Greek-style “soundscape” chorus of women (Bacchantes?), who later reappear as the blasted Mametz trees of the familiar imagery, and later still as the “regenerated” forest, with Albert Herring flowery hats, all cleverly, even wittily, designed by Robert Innes Hopkins.So far from the soldiers destroying the trees, it’s the trees that gobble up the soldiers, one by one, and to tell the truth somewhat laboriously, like the serial guillotining at the end of Poulenc’s Carmelites, and with about as much justice. But then if the Somme was among other things an environmental disaster, no doubt we are all to blame. Or is it just the girls taking their revenge for the boys’ silly wargames?The two veterans squabble about their ancestry like pickled KundrysMuch of this plods along musically and dramatically somewhat in the manner of an oratorio, without much dramatic impulse, but with some fine choruses, notably a memorable setting of the Welsh song “Sosban fach”, sung and staged with uninhibited relish as the men sit in a French café waiting for the order to advance. Before this, there’s a striking cameo, straight out of the book, in which the two veterans, Dai Greatcoat (Donald Maxwell) and the Marne Sergeant (Graham Clark) squabble about their ancestry like a pair of pickled Kundrys (“I was with Abel when his brother found him under the green tree;” “I built a shit-house for Artaxerxes,” etc.).Such moments might justify the general approach, even if they miss the intimacy and rich inwardness of the book. An opera, you could say, is not a book. But then not every book is, potentially, an opera, at least on the scale offered here. One is left with the best moments and some expert performances. Peter Coleman-Wright and Alexandra Deshorties are as good as possible as the bardic chorus, a shade patronising and even, in her case, possessively maternal, vocally excellent. Mark Le Brocq blusters efficiently as Sergeant Snell until his head is blown off, and there are good vignettes from George Humphreys as the fated, helpless Lieutenant Jenkins, and Joe Roche and Martin Lloyd as a duo of what one might call disposable privates.Carlo Rizzi conducts this occasionally constipated score with due dedication. Bellini it isn’t. But then come to think of it, Bell, who writes fluently for the voice, might pick up a lesson from his near namesake about keeping even this superb orchestra more firmly in its place",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/parenthesis-welsh-national-opera,3
227,"Pleasure, Royal Opera, Lyric Hammersmith",Pleasure,Royal Opera,2016-05-13,Bernard Hughes,"A 28-year-old British composer makes his name with a new four-hand opera, set in contemporary Britain but underpinned by classical legend, pushing the boundaries of operatic subject matter and launching a glittering career. This was Mark-Antony Turnage and his breakthrough work Greek in 1988, showing uncanny parallels with Mark Simpson and his new opera Pleasure.Where Turnage set the Oedipus story in the 1980s East End, Simpson and his librettist Melanie Challenger, tell an original story, based on the myth of Hephaestus, and set it in the toilet of a gay nightclub. Although seeming at first sight perhaps meretricious, Simpson explains that the inspiration came from his own experiences of Liverpool nightlife in his teens and early twenties. “As I stood pouring my heart out to a toilet attendant, I suddenly started to see the world around me with a new sense of objectivity.” Fast forward a few years, and that toilet attendant is being played on the London stage by Lesley Garrett.Although Garrett is nowadays best known as a chart-topping – dread term – “crossover artist”, and proud to be one of ITV’s Loose Women, she was an ENO principal from 1984-98. In Pleasure, she produces a proper operatic performance and shows that years of singing lighter repertoire have not dulled her operatic chops.It was only in Val’s final lament that the story and character became truly engaging. Her character, Val, is a confessor for customers of the club and a sparring partner for the resident drag queen Anna Fewmore (Steven Page). Val has a dark back story of domestic abuse which is stirred up by the arrival of a young man, Nathan (Timothy Nelson, pictured above right), who turns out to be her long-abandoned son. Her second betrayal of him leads to the story’s tragic climax.Even then, it was only by way of a moment of melodrama which felt over-egged even within an opera. For much of the piece, for all the rapid activity and best efforts of the cast, nothing really happened, the whole thing jogging on the spot.The musical score was often more beguiling than the stage action, and often very beguiling indeed. There was little reference to the dance music of the club setting, but the inclusion of a synth keyboard gave a Pet Shop Boys gloss to the ensemble’s sound. The music was restlessly inventive, fertile and well-scored, earning its moments of repose, which were stunningly beautiful. Psappha, led energetically by Nicholas Kok, were exemplary, the clarinet playing of Dov Goldberg and Scott Lygate excellent. (Simpson clearly revelling in writing for his own instrument.) The music was full of tonal references and never highly dissonant. In some respects it called to mind Nico Muhly, whose ENO debut Two Boys in 2011 also dealt with a contemporary theme – cyber-stalking – and whose music also rose above the limitations of the storyline.The singing was very good from all four of the cast, especially baritone Steven Page (pictured above). His drag queen, often seen in backstage dressing gown, was gaudy in the limelight and catty out of it. The aria in which he appeared in, and gradually destroyed, a dress of coloured balloons was very entertaining.The design used a split level arrangement, with the band “upstairs”, emphasising the action was taking place in the depths, figuratively and literally. The lighting design was excellent: appropriately dingy, the letters of the word “pleasure” were outlined in various neon shades and, in the final moments, burnt dazzlingly, transfiguring the toilet into a sacred space.It seems certain that Mark Simpson’s career will shine with similar brightness in the coming years, in much the way Mark-Antony Turnage’s has, although for my money, Greek has the edge over Pleasure, all things considered.In a recent TV interview with Lorraine Kelly, Lesley Garrett celebrated the fact of a lead operatic role being written for a woman in her sixties, and in this respect of broadening the repertoire Mark Simpson is to be congratulated. But Pleasure does more than simply challenging operatic orthodoxies: it is a notable debut opera.@bernardlhughes",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/pleasure-royal-opera-lyric-hammersmith,3
228,"Die Zauberflöte, Budapest Festival Orchestra, Fischer, RFH",Die Zauberflöte,Budapest Festival Orchestra,2016-05-11,David Nice,"Sunlit golden mean or slightly hazy middle-of-the-road? Conductor-director Iván Fischer's fully costumed and imagined concert of The Magic Flute - or perhaps it would better have been titled Die ZauberFlute given its intelligent mix of sung German and English dialogue taken by six excellent young British-based actors - was always going to be hard pressed to match the recent, hyper-communicative English National Opera/Complicite revival.In fact, its concept shaped up rather well in comparison. But whereas ENO had at least two world-class singers in the Tamino of Allan Clayton and Lucy Crowe's Pamina, last night's was a cast you'd have been happy to catch in a regional German opera house, but not, with one exception, up to the standards of the greatFischer and his Budapest Festival Orchestra, unfathomably beleaguered by a cut of three quarters to its municipal grant. The capital of Hungary, a country in the grip of a very unenlightened regime, clearly wants to punish the outspoken Fischer and one of the world's most distinctive-sounding orchestras.The initial approach, once past the conductor's charming introductory pretence that the actors were pulled straight out of the audience (pictured right: Bart van der Schaaf's speaker-Papageno with the Old Woman), was broader than that of ENO's Mark Wigglesworth, but superbly articulate once the Allegro got going, and took on a different colour as the Overture's development heads into the woods. This was a lightish, deft approach, the woodwind feminine or a bit pale according to taste, but always alert.It was a bit of a shame that the scores's two most serious moments, fully realised by Fischer, were undermined by the children's-picture-book images on the big screen. When hero Tamino faces endless night and is told that it will come to an end ""soon - or never"", we need a more daunting image than the naive temple-gate illustrations; Ingmar Bergman, who described this as ""music at the outer limits of existence"", started his genius film in rococo prettiness, only to dissolve it once Tamino sets out on his journey. Here we got the shadows and half the orchestra backstage for Sarastro's brotherhood in Act Two, but reverted to Tolkienesque mountains for the trials of fire and water.Even so, Fischer left us in no doubt of the music's depths - respectively mysterious and Bach-majestic - at both points. His Tamino did well with the first moment of crisis, too. Bernard Richter's handsome hero was too much the light lyric to pull out the dramatic stops when he needed to turn Heldentenor. His best moments were reacting to the flute's animal-charming and in the quintets, graced by three top-notch Ladies and a Lieder-quality Papageno from Hanno Müller-Brachmann, the finest principal in the cast. Hanna-Elisabeth Müller's Pamina (embracing Richter's Tamino onstage, pictured above) had the clarity but not the bloom around the voice. Krisztián Cser's Sarastro needed more support to sustain a line in his second-act arias and Mandy Friedrich's Queen of the Night had the notes - just, though the ornamentations were approximate - but not the fierce demeanour, stepping out of her moon-chariot in Act One and swishing around like an indifferent Russian mail-order bride.Admirably, there was no miking for the keen projection of the actors - dominated by Bart van der Schaaf's genuinely funny, natural Papageno-in-speech, briefly and wittily usurped by Müller-Brachmann in the second encounter with Papagena-as-old-woman - nor the Three Boys, drawn from the Hungarian State Opera Children's Chorus and charmingly playing the lions' parts too. Charming, too, to learn that Fischer sang the role of Second Boy at the age of 12. What he described as a ""staged concert"" never went for overkill in treating the Flute as pure fairy-tale (another curtain call ensemble with singers and their actor-doubles pictured below).The tricks with players and chorus behind the screen for the Brotherhood's councils were clever - they certainly made you realise Mozart's selective orchestration when the upper half of the ensemble was sitting down in the pit - but recessed the choral sound and dimmed its full impact. Still, who couldn't be moved by the final revelation of full orchestra finally translated to the stage at the end, kissed and beflowered by the reunited Tamino and Pamina? Mozart's message, that music unites us all, is timeless, and Fischer, as well as being a master technician among conductors, is one of its most inspiring ambassadors in the world today. Shame on the Budapest politicians for messing with his great orchestra.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/die-zauberflote-budapest-festival-orchestra-fischer-rfh,3
229,"Il Vologeso, Classical Opera, Cadogan Hall",Il Vologeso,Classical Opera,2016-04-29,David Nice,"A mere 10 minutes in to this concert performance of an 18th century delight by Neapolitan Niccolò Jommelli, you knew the form to expect for the rest of the evening. Ian Page's Classical Orchestra kicked off with bracing rhythmic vitality from the start, and sounded super-bright in Cadogan acoustics so ideal for their forces. Then three of the main singers quickly showed their total classiness – the others were not to disappoint – with vivid continuo support led by the best in the business, Christopher Bucknall. And Mattia Verazi's crisp, clean libretto made the set-up clear very quickly: Roman tyrant Lucio Varo loves Berenice, the betrothed of defeated Parthian king Vologeso, thought to be dead but very much alive.No question about the worthiness in reviving the 48th of Jommelli's 59 operas (if I've counted correctly, not including second to fourth versions): it has a great deal more originality and inventiveness, especially in the string writing, than early Mozart or most of Haydn's operas. Though hardly profound, Jommelli seems to care about psychology: much of his recitativo accompagnato (in other words, with full orchestra rather than harpsichord, cello and bass) offers some startling harmonic progressions and painstaking nuance for each emotion, especially before the two main arias of Berenice where the violins weep for her predicament. You sometimes feel that Jommelli is less interested in the vocal writing, but intelligence from all concerned here made that less of a liability.Berenice's second-act set piece, in which she's caught in the awful situation of giving her very unwilling hand to Lucio to save Vologeso's life, fully reflects the wavering in musical contrasts and pauses. The Emperor's semi-mad scenes, on the other hand, and the macabre dumb-show he sets up to break her, possibly dragging out the last act without visual spectacle to match, sound original but oddly pastoral and lacking a real heart of darkness.They were superbly handled, all the same by the magnificent players – the oboe duo, especially - and by tenor Stuart Jackson (pictured above). Relaxied in his delineation of the bully's casual cruelty, finger-snapping and all, limpid in love and dazzling in coloratura rage, this young singer can do it all. But then so can Gemma Summerfield, clearly a worthy winner of the 2015 Kathleen Ferrier Award (pictured below left at the final): her Berenice was regal, vivid and possessed of a whole range of tone-colour, suggesting not just an ideal Mozart Countess but also a possible Strauss soprano in the making. It's early days yet, though – she's still studying at the Royal College of Music – but Summerfield already seems to be the complete artist.Even more so, if possible, is Rachel Kelly (main picture), a total natural with a vibrant mezzo voice seemingly flawless throughout the range. You wanted her Vologeso to have a solo of the calibre of Sesto's ""Parto, parto"" from Mozart's La clemenza di Tito. Jommelli didn't quite provide that, and yet Kelly still made her urgency felt, persuading us with natural body language as well as focused urgency that the recitatives are as crucial a part of the drama as the arias and finales.As if that weren't enough we also had a second mezzo of sensual quality in Angela Simkin, joining the Royal Opera's Jette Parker Young Artists Programme at the start of next season and plangent as Lucio's rejected fiancee whose magnanimity produces an unlikely volte face at the end. Fourth in a superbly contrasted line up of women's voices was Jennifer France, a lighter soprano than Summerfield but brilliant in her flights all the same; the orchestral support for her one number is one of the major delights of the score. Only counter-tenor Tom Verney as Lucio's attendant Aniceto didn't really get a chance to shine.All praise to Page, then, for knowing exactly the right voices to cast: this is the second time this season – Rossi's Orpheus at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse being the first – that I've reeled at the young talent coming straight out of our music colleges. The Italian coaching would seem to have been excellent; everyone knew exactly what they were supposed to be doing at any given point, and no-one was bound to the score (the line-up of the musically fine  Jenůfa in concert the other week was put to shame). Every aspect of this totally pleasurable evening, a bracing halfway house between Handel and Mozart, confirmed that everything Classical Opera puts on will be worth seeking out. Microphones suggested a recording in the offing; if so, I'd snap it up straight away.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/il-vologeso-classical-opera-cadogan-hall,5
230,"Tannhäuser, Royal Opera",Tannhäuser,Royal Opera,2016-04-27,Gavin Dixon,"Tim Albery’s 2010 production of Wagner's Tannhäuser is back for a revival at Royal Opera, featuring a different conductor and a nearly new cast, with one notable exception. The production itself is serviceable, visually coherent and with plenty of atmosphere. The sets, by Michael Levine begin with a replica of the Covent Garden proscenium arch in the Venusberg scene, which is then shown in progressive states of decay in the following acts. The Venusberg choreography, by Jasmin Vardimon, is modern and slick, as dynamic as it is sensual.The drama that follows is much more static, however, with brief moments of illuminating Personenregie, particularly in the song contest. Costumes, by Jon Morrell, are a mix of new and old, mostly in drab colours, with the crowd in the song contest incongruously dressed as Kalashnikov-toting guerrillas. Disparate ideas, but they all fit together, in a production that for this revival proves a good vehicle for a close to ideal cast in the major roles.Conductor Hartmut Haenchen can’t match the effortless breadth and fluency that Semyon Bychkov brought to the production on its first run – who could? But nor does he try: Haenchen’s approach is slicker, less opulent but more dynamic. Tempos are generally fast – the performance ended 20 minutes earlier than advertised – and phrasing is clipped and precise. Some of the more lyrical passages loose out under Haenchen’s baton, particularly the Pilgrim’s Chorus, which never fully blooms. But Haenchen has a good sense for the progression through Wagner's music, always elegantly shaping the drama. Sometimes he leaves the singers behind, though: his fast pace in the Act II “Landgraf Hermann, Heil!” almost lost the chorus, and Hermann himself (Stephen Milling) lagged behind in the following narration. First night woes only, one hopes.The 2010 cast was impressive (Johan Botha, Eva-Maria Westbroek, Michaela Schuster), but the singers assembled for this revival are even more so, particularly for their suitability to their respective roles. Sophie Koch is an alluring Venus, with a rich, silky tone. Her diction is poor though, with barely a word audible. Peter Seiffert is a fine Tannhäuser, with a powerful, commanding tone and richly expressive delivery. He had some problems with the louder passages on the first night, particularly in the Rome narrative, where his voice often broke off on high-phrase endings. But in the quieter music, particularly in the second act, his characterisation was excellent, Tannhäuser's increasing sense of guilt and remorse powerfully portrayed through Seiffert’s increasingly anguished utterances. Emma Bell has a suitably pure tone for Elisabeth: her voice is a little narrow in the louder music, but it is just about big enough for the role, and she too acts as convincingly as she sings. Stephen Milling’s Herrmann was the best of the supporting roles, his tone smooth, even and well projected.But best of all was Christian Gerhaher as Wolfram (pictured above). It’s his signature role, which he first sang at the Royal Opera in 2010, and Covent Garden is one of the many houses around the world where it is now almost impossible to imagine anybody else singing it. Gerhaher is first and foremost a recitalist, and he has previously performed Wolfram in that spirit, coming on, singing and then leaving again. But there is more characterisation in his performance now, more interaction, with Elisabeth in Act II and with Tannhäuser in Act III. Vocally, he is as fine as ever, with a distinctive timbre that can effortlessly carry across any texture, the colour simultaneously warm and complex. Last time round he completely stole the show. This time he’s in a stronger cast, but he’s still the main draw.@saquabote",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/tannh%C3%A4user-royal-opera-0,3
231,"Don Giovanni / Pia de' Tolomei, English Touring Opera",Don Giovanni / Pia de' Tolomei,English Touring Opera,2016-04-25,Richard Bratby,"The curtain is up for the overture to English Touring Opera’s new production of Don Giovanni, but no-one is on stage. Instead, we gaze at Anna Fleischle’s set: a creation in two layers. On the top, elegant Klimt panels glint with gold. Below, and joined to the opulence above by a rickety looking metal fire escape, is a Piranesi-like underworld of drab brick, archways and mysteriously curving passages – perfect for lurking or throwing sinister shadows.It’s charged with potential: Ego and Id; the elegant surface of fin-de-siècle Vienna, and its troubled sexual subculture. By moving the action into the world of Freud and Schnitzler, director Lloyd Wood has done that very ETO thing of taking a necessary limitation of touring – the need for a single, adaptable set – and opening up all sorts of imaginative possibilities. As Michael Rosewell propelled the ETO orchestra through a taut, headlong overture and lighting designer Guy Hoare’s spotlights slowly wandered this theatre of the unconscious, probing its corners, you prepared yourself for a Don Giovanni that asked some unsettling questions.It didn’t quite work out like that. It’s hard to imagine how Mozart’s astonishing opening scene couldn’t work, yet as the Commendatore (Piotr Lempa) sauntered casually down the stairway to confront Don Giovanni, the tension just drained away. There didn’t feel like much danger in the air here, for all the Don’s (George von Bergen) swashbuckling entrance and Johnny Depp sex appeal: masked, with shirt open to the waist. Well, things can sometimes wobble on tour (we’ll chalk the over-loud electronic harpsichord up to that, too). The evening rapidly pulled into focus, though the person doing a lot of the pulling was Matthew Stiff’s genial, put-upon Leporello. This was a likeably comic reading of the role, and with the entrance of Masetto (Bradley Travis) and Lucy Hall’s bright, coquettish Zerlina, Woods’s whole production tilted in that direction: pacey and entertaining, a dramma giocoso with the emphasis very much on the giocoso.There’s lots to be said for that approach. ETO’s remit is to reach venues that opera doesn’t usually reach, and a production that tells the story relatively straight can still have a powerful effect – as the reactions of this capacity crowd at Buxton Opera House proved. In fact, with the visual clutter of Kaspar Holten’s recent Royal Opera House production still in mind, the clarity of the storytelling was positively refreshing. Fleischle’s costumes and the Viennese setting helped there, stylishly indicating the social class and ambitions of the three principal ladies – Camilla Roberts’s Donna Anna a model of bourgeois respectability, Zerlina every inch the susses mädel-on-the-make, and Elvira (Ania Jeruc, pictured above right) glamorous in a fishtail gown as a sort of Adele Bloch-Bauer socialite.Alongside Hall’s minxy squeals and sunny, light opera tone, Jenuc’s vocal performance was particularly fascinating: Roberts and Robin Lyn Evans (Don Ottavio), both fine singers, seemed to be having an off night. Jenuc has a warm voice, with a soft but plangent edge which gave her Elvira a poignancy that made her final humiliation by Giovanni – pelting her with food at his Act Two banquet – all the more upsetting. But Bergen’s confident, commanding Giovanni had easily the most charismatic voice on stage, and this sat uncomfortably with his flashes of genuinely unpleasant violence. Wrenching Anna’s and Zerlina’s arms behind their backs, there was no question that this was a Giovanni who made his conquests by force rather than persuasion.Still, at the end he went down with enormous style, and a Wagnerian surge of sound. The return of the Commendatore was one of the most effective – and excitingly staged – that I’ve seen. But those moments of naked brutality jarred with the overall tone, even if they’re wholly justified by character and subtext. A Don Giovanni that doesn’t disturb probably isn’t (and shouldn’t be) possible today. There’s a darker, nastier, more consistent production lurking inside this one: future revivals will be worth watching.The setting for James Conway’s UK premiere production of Donizetti’s 1837 opera seria Pia de’ Tolomei looked for all the world like a segment of the Don Giovanni set, reversed. More ETO resourcefulness? Loren Elstein’s designs put the chorus in generic black, the cast in generic medieval(ish), and left the whole thing to play out amidst what looked like a rehearsal space hastily cleared in a gloomy backstage area. It seemed a pity: ETO is rightly proud of this production, the latest in a series of Donizetti rediscoveries that's thrown up duds (The Siege of Calais) as well as real finds (The Wild Man of the West Indies). Pia de’ Tolomei, the Dante-inspired tragedy of a wife falsely accused of infidelity by a spurned would-be lover, is unquestionably a find. More than that, it’s hugely impressive: an impassioned, storm tossed score which – once you get past Donizetti’s habit of setting bloodcurdling choruses at a jaunty major key jog-trot – develops its characters with considerable depth and nuance. I’m not asking for the full Zeffirelli: but as a premiere production, some flavour (even just a touch) of place and period would surely have helped the opera make even more of an impact.Perhaps that’s unfair. In the context it’s hard to imagine how these performances could have been bettered. Every major role was impressively sung, from the spectacular vocal range and impetuous moodswings of tenor Luciano Botelho as the jealous Ghino to the curious trouser role of Rodrigo (Catherine Carby – lit by a single spotlight for her dungeon scene and by turns sombre and spirited). At the centre of it all, though, were two performances that were superb by any standard. Grant Doyle (pictured left, with Catherine Carby [left] and Elena Xanthoudakis [centre]) was the heroine’s husband Nello, a dignified man broken by his own lack of trust. Doyle’s sonorous, majestic baritone served a characterisation that moved from affronted arrogance to desperate pain without varnishing one or blunting the other. And against him, vulnerable and defiant, proud and tender, was Elena Xanthoudakis as Pia herself: an utterly convincing performance that managed to be both bring-the-house down brilliant and profoundly touching. Xanthoudakis’s voice danced over Donizetti’s fiendish coloratura with liquid grace; blazing thrillingly at the top and, in quieter passages, capable of anything from a wounded snarl to melting sweetness. Who says you need to be at a major opera house to hear singing of this quality?  John Andrews, conducting, swept the whole thing forwards in big, powerful paragraphs, relishing Donizetti’s sombre colours and releasing a raw power that I hadn’t realised the ETO Chorus possessed. Michael Tanner recently summarised Donizetti’s legacy as ""two works of comic genius, and several that are at least the equal of Verdi’s works up until his middle period."" It’s intended as a deep compliment when I say that Pia de’ Tolomei can be categorized as one of the latter. This production is a magnificent vindication of ETO artistic director James Conway’s commitment to Donizetti. If you love bel canto, you should definitely see it. If you don’t, the same applies.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/don-giovanni-pia-de-tolomei-english-touring-opera,4
232,"Shakespeare 400 Gala, LPO, Jurowski, RFH",Shakespeare 400 Gala,LPO,2016-04-24,David Nice,"Every year is Shakespeare year in theatre, opera house and concert hall. An anniversary's best, though, for those select few galas where the mind's made flexible by constant comparison between different Shakespearean worlds. I don't know how it was at Stratford last night – BBC Two will provide opportunity enough to catch up – but things could hardly have been more impressive on the Southbank, where Vladimir Jurowski and his London Philharmonic Orchestra reminded us what a gamut they've run both at Glyndebourne and at the Royal Festival Hall. They had a starry line-up of singers and actors to help them.How could any top-notch musical tribute to the Bard not begin with the storm scene from Verdi's Otello, possibly the most exciting curtain-up on any opera and certainly the most apocalyptic? With Festival Hall organ providing the pedal, a necessarily small but splendid and, of course, young Glyndebourne Chorus reacted to the orchestral lightning flashes and thunderbolts whipcracked into action by Jurowski, razor sharp as ever.But how far was it going to go – where was our Otello? Caribbean-born Ronald Samm, who first gave a performance of such intensity for Graham Vick's Birmingham Opera Company production in 2010 (pictured right by Rex), stepped up for the taxing ""Esultate!"" – making exactly the right sound, coming off the treacherous top notes quickly and artistically.Enter Iago, speaking Shakespeare's text; from my position high up in a box, I thought it was Dominic West already, inflecting clearly, but when Jurowski segued into Verdi's ""Credo"", it turned out to be Simon Keenlyside – perhaps too noble a baritone voice for the inky-black ""motiveless malignity"" of the role, but phrasing intelligently. Ditto Kate Royal in Desdemona's ""Willow Song"", the sighing ""salces"" differently coloured and inflected each time. A scherzo was needed; we got not the whole of Berlioz's best of all dream-picture Mabs from his Roméo et Juliette, alas, but the preview nimbly provided by tenor (Toby Spence) and semi-chorus, a mere prelude to Prokofiev's ""Montagues and Capulets"". The flute melody doubled by string glissandi as Juliet dances haltingly with Paris at the centrepoint has surely never been more magically done, nor the transition back to the striding violence of the Knights more hair-raising. West gave us supreme intelligence in Hamlet's ""To be or not to be""; his Ophelia, unusual casting for Anna Chancellor, was less clear, but that may have been the miking from where I was sitting, patchy like the lighting. Jurowski reprised a rarity he's given us here before, Tchaikovsky's truncated fantasy-overture Hamlet in its incidental-music version, still masterly but missing some of the best bits, and one of Ophelia's mad scenes from the same, Royal (pictured above left) taking over from Chancellor. The first half ended with pure dream in a starry Vaughan Williams Serenade to Music, feather-bed perfection from the orchestra, spotlit leader Vesselin Gellev and the 16 soloists. It's probably the first time a counter-tenor has taken a part in the rhapsody, and Iestyn Davies was back as Oberon in capital-D Dream following the groaning of the wood in Britten's Shakespeare masterpiece, sparring with Allison Bell's Tytania and backed up by superlative boy-fairies from Trinity School. Neat segue into Mendelssohn's ""Ye spotted snakes"", taken as deftly as the Wedding March by Jurowski in most original form, with the intermezzo of Shakespeare's Bottom-as-ass (Samms getting plenty of laughs with a Trinidadian accent) to Tytania (Chancellor at her best; shame she never got to play a strong tragic heroine). Good, too, that Jurowski showed us how Mendelssohn's, and later Walton's, music worked as background to speech in that unfashionable form known as melodrama.If there was any dip in the perfect flow of the programme, devised by Simon Callow along with Jurowski and CEO Tim Walker over three years, it came not in the music-making but in the actual stuff itself of Adès's The Tempest. No masterpiece as a whole, it has great sequences, but Prospero's dialogues with Caliban and Ariel followed by Meredith Oakes' unmagical reduction of ""Full Fathom Five"" are not among them. Still, premiere performers Keenlyside and Spence followed by Bell's perfectly stratospheric Ariel made much of the awkward vocal writing. Only here would I have pleaded for a greater alternative, something of Sibelius's incidental music which has substance as well as original sound, but it was fair enough to have another Brit on show as well as something contemporary (though Adès's score often feels a bit establishment to me, more so than Britten's Dream). The blood and guts of the second half came in a sequence from Henry V, Callow appearing as Chorus but not as clear sound- or text-wise as West's Hal (the actor as Coriolanus in one of the Globe's riverside films currently on display pictured right), backed up by Walton's film music. Jurowski can be a cool customer, but he and the orchestra let rip in the battle sequence, part ripped-off from Prokofiev's Alexander Nevsky but with splendid tunes of its own. Any one of the three finales which followed could have brought down the curtain, starting with the chorus resplendent alongside organ and brass in Walton's final victory song. Another singer with equal skills as an actor ambled on with antlers on his head, Andrew Shore as Falstaff as Herne the Hunter, to give us a relaxed take on Shakespeare before a smooth transition to the only possible official conclusion, the final fuguing-for-all of Verdi's swansong. What a pity, though, that this was all we really heard of soprano Gabriela  Iştoc, dazzling as Alice Ford.William Hardy's splendid Puck then handed out scores to all the soloists for Mendelssohn's Dream conclusion, sneaking in a bit of the Overture we'd so missed for ""Through the house with glimmering light"". And if the audience broke in with applause for his envoi before the last magical chords of Mendelssohn's genius had died away, that was in true Globe spirit. One might wish for more orchestral rarities in the rest of Shakespeare year – Raff's amazingly good fantasias on four of the plays, Massenet's Scènes dramatiques – but in terms of serving up the best in classy style, this celebration could hardly have been surpassed.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/shakespeare-400-gala-lpo-jurowski-rfh,4
233,"Jenůfa, Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, Bělohlávek, RFH",Jenůfa,Czech Philharmonic Orchestra,2016-04-19,David Nice,"Janáček's lacerating music-drama of love-led sin and redemption in a 19th century Moravian village is the opera I'd recommend as the first port of call for theatregoers wary of the genre. Its emotional truths are unflinching, its lyricism as constantly surprising as the actions of its characters are often swift and violent. In the opera house, I've never seen a performance that didn't turn its audience inside out. For all the revelations of orchestral beauty, though, a concert performance without a hint of semi-staging can't hope to achieve anything like the same effect, however fine the sounds – and some of last night's were as remarkable as they come. Just not, in many cases, quite right.That was true of the smooth and sophisticated Czech Philharmonic, consistently beautiful. There's an argument for more sharp edges than this Bohemian ensemble cares to find; Moravian Brno, I'm told, is the place to hear Janáček, and that was where the magnificent and vigorous chorus hailed from (it goes by the slightly confusing name of the Czech Philhamonic Choir of Brno). While veteran interpreter of his native music Jiří Bělohlávek (pictured below) clearly knows Jenůfa inside out, mouthing all the mostly naturalistic, fast-moving text without reference to the score, his approach veers more to the luminous than the tense and dramatic.Still, what a luxury to hear such warm wind playing, with first bassoonist Ondřej Roskovec outstanding, the striking horn parts both stopped and open taking full effect, and harpist Jana Boušková coming to the fore with Janáček's unusual writing to depict rippling water when our heroine, told she should have been a teacher, declares several times over that her intelligence has ""gone downstream"".The smaller roles, odd as it may seem to start with them among the soloists, could not have been better taken. There were strong cameos from Marta Reichelová as exuberant shepherd boy Jano, Kateřina Jalovcová making her mark in the more relaxed opening of Act Three and impressive baritone Svatopluk Sem as the Foreman of the Mill (its revolving wheel, figured on repeated low xylophone notes, acts as a figure of tense fate in Act One). As the village girl Barena, Kateřina Kněžíková made enough of an impression to suggest that she might be a Jenůfa-in-waiting, while Yvona Škvárová, as Grandmother Buryjovka, could still cut to the quick as Buryjovka's stern daughter the Kostelnička or village sacristan.This is the role to which many sopranos and some mezzos aspire in later years, given the spotlight on the Kostelnička's extraordinary predicament in the harrowing second act where she thinks she’s giving her stepdaughter Jenůfa a better chance of happiness by drowning the poor girl’s illegitimate baby in the mill stream. Karita Mattila (pictured above in a rare moment looking up) was sounding at her incandescent best, which might have given an interesting characterisation of a wamer than usual nature had she not taken her score off the stand and held it, eyes glued downwards.Admittedly the point of no return, when she finally engaged with the audience and threw her entire body as well as sound into the climactic moment of decision, was thrilling, and all the top notes were there. But why the restless fiddling with the not quite appropriate concert dress around the shoulders, a distraction when she should be offstage and all eyes fixed on Jenůfa? Why no reaction to the news that the baby's corpse has been found beneath the ice? And while she may well go on to develop the role and give of her usual stage-animal intensity in the opera house, Mattila's voice is still too lovely and lacking in steel, still tonally a better fit for the girl rather than the stepmother. Memories of the definitive if much more raw Kostelnička of Anja Silja, one of the all-time great performances, were never quite banished.Had Slovakian soprano Adriana Kohútková been a stronger Jenůfa, the essential dynamic between two women – Southbank please note that Gabriela Preissová’s original play is a masterpiece of feminine if not feminist insight – might have come across with the searing contrasts it really needs. As it was, they barely looked at each other. Kohútková can send out radiant sound above the stave, but the voice often disappeared in the middle and lower range.Best cast of the principals – though Jaroslav Březina’s jack-the-lad Števa certainly acted with the voice – was Aleš Briscein (pictured above) as Laca, the restless outsider whose jealousy of Jenůfa’s lover when he praises her rosy cheeks leads him to slash her face with a knife, an act which precipitates the tragedy. This tenor cut like a dagger throughout, brought the deeper emotion oddly missing in Jenůfa’s heavy lament for her dead child in his subsequent entry and flared up heart-stoppingly in his declaration of profound love in the last act. When, after the Kostelnička is led out for trial, Laca stands by Jenůfa and they face a difficult future together, the tears did finally flow. But they should really do so throughout, and that's certain to happen when ENO revives David Alden's production in June. In the meantime, with no inappropriate evening wear or lack of entrances and exits to worry about, this could well be a whole different experience as broadcast on BBC Radio 3.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/jen%C5%AFfa-czech-philharmonic-orchestra-belohlavek-rfh,3
234,"Rusalka, Scottish Opera",Rusalka,Scottish Opera,2016-04-15,Christopher Lambton,"For the gentleman next to me in the Festival Theatre, this was his second outing to see Rusalka. At the production premiere earlier this month in Glasgow, he had been “blown away” by Dvořák's lyric masterpiece. Given half a chance, I would go back to Edinburgh for the second and last performance in this run; not only because this is a brilliant, beautifully judged performance, but also because the opportunity might never come again. Rusalka was last staged in Scotland by a Czech company in 1964. Will we really have to wait until the 2060s to see another?The neglect of Rusalka is puzzling. Like many in the Edinburgh audience I have only ever heard the justifiably famous “Song to the moon”, heard early in the first act, the melting cadences of which make it a popular lollipop in many sopranos' repertoire. But although this aria, and more particularly its beguiling introduction, is never far away throughout the rest of the opera, there’s so much more to Dvořák's scintillating score. Notwithstanding a huge debt to Wagner’s Tristan (three rising notes, resolving peacefully, recur again and again), the orchestral score is luminously beautiful and often dramatic. And for those who may sometimes be wearied by the relentlessly sunny disposition of Dvořák's symphonic music, there is deep sadness by the watery bucketful.The production, designed and directed by Antony McDonald, is new to Scottish Opera but had an earlier life at Grange Park Opera in Hampshire. In a nifty piece of footwork Scottish Opera bought the whole thing, packed it into a container, and dumped it in a storage unit on the banks of the River Clyde. For its re-emergence, five years later, the original director returns, along with choreographer Lucy Burge, lighting designer Wolfgang Goebbel, and the slight but determined figure of Anne Sophie Duprels in the title role. Other members of the cast are new to this production: a magnificent Sir Willard White (pictured above) as her father the merman, Peter Wedd as the Prince, and the Welsh soprano Natalya Romaniw as the intolerant “Foreign Princess”. The singing, without exception, is excellent throughout.The tale of Rusalka is a sorry one indeed. A water-nymph, little more than a splash in a forest pool, wants to take on human form to love the huntsman whose naked body she holds in her watery embrace during his daily swim. Her old man urges caution, but seeing her determination sends her off to get a potion from Leah-Marian Jones’s sinister witch. 15 minutes into the opera, we know it’s not going to end well. The love affair implodes, the witch’s curse returns, and the lovers are doomed – the Prince dies and Rusalka wanders off to a half-life of eternal misery.It’s all highly operatic, as ridiculous a piece of hokum as any number of mid-19th century supernatural operas, but the brilliance of McDonald’s production is somehow to make the whole business seem, dare I say it, believable. There are many small touches of gritty realism: we don’t see it but the witch brutally hacks off Rusalka’s fishy tale, to reveal bloody and scarred legs on which the poor girl can scarcely walk. As a grisly afterthought, she then tips a bucket of blood and gore back into the pool (pictured below, Peter Wedd as the Prince).Later, as Rusalka is prepared for her wedding to the Prince, she becomes hopelessly tangled in what could be either a huge wedding veil or a fishing net. Her writhing and wriggling to free herself are painful to watch, not least because Duprels is a superb mover and actress. The chorus is never seen but a troupe of a dozen or so dancers fill the stage with antics whose ostensible comedy moves rapidly towards the sinister and grotesque. There are few laughs – not even the decadent wedding feast with suavely camp waiters and overt sexual overtones. At one point two of the dancers spend an entire scene filleting fish – the fish were real but they wouldn’t get a job in a Leith fishmonger any time soon.The effect of this realism transforms the story from one of indifference (who really cares, these days, about lovelorn princes and water-nymphs?) to one of universal humanity. And yes we do care, we care for Rusalka, (literally) a fish out of water whose fragile beauty and deep love are insufficient to break down the prejudice and snobbery of an aristocratic court. We care for the Prince, torn between hopeless passion for a mysterious and elusive figure and the feisty demands of a real life genuine chip-off-the-old-block Princess who is determined to get her man.The transition from Grange Park to Scottish Opera appears to be a felicitous one, not least because the resources of each seem quite closely matched -- neither company could afford a wedding banquet for a hundred. With the possible exception of the orchestra; for this production we had a huge band of around 70, playing superbly under the direction of the newly appointed Music Director Stuart Stratford. If this is a portent for the future, then things are looking up for Scotland’s national opera company.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/rusalka-scottish-opera,5
235,"Lucia di Lammermoor, Royal Opera",Lucia di Lammermoor,Royal Opera,2016-04-08,alexandra Coghlan,"Lucia di Lammermoor is an opera in which men spend an awful lot of time talking about women, and very little actually talking to them. (Which, if nothing else, ensures a rather more dramatic denouement than a frank conversation about everyone’s hopes and dreams would produce.) Enter director Katie Mitchell and her “strong feminist agenda”, determined to give Donizetti’s women back their voices, and with them the agency every plot twist in the opera conspires to deny. If the result is by no means a classic production, neither is it the all-out assault on tradition and decency the Royal Opera’s recent warnings of sex and violence led us to believe.Rather than throwing out the familiar fixtures and fittings of this Gothic tragedy, Mitchell simply appropriates them, redirecting our focus, realigning our perspective, rather than reimagining from scratch. Instead of releasing her characters into the outdoor landscapes of Wolf’s Crag, the castle’s park and gardens – home to men at work and play – she cages them in a feminine world of interior spaces. They may move from bedroom to bathroom, to drawing room and mausoleum, but are always enclosed, entrapped.Then she splits the stage in half. Two playing spaces run concurrently throughout, juxtaposing Donizetti’s action with the opera’s “offstage” narrative. Lucia’s story – the deceptions of her secret affair with Edgardo, her relationship with her servant Alisa, her endless dressings and undressings, and, of course, the murder of her husband Arturo – all happen in full view. It’s meticulous psychological stuff, beautifully framed in Vicki Mortimer’s elegant 1830s designs. The trouble is that it’s all happening at the same time as the men swear vengeance, plot alliances and plan duels – action crucial to establishing and developing the characters of the majority of the (male) cast.By creating straw men of her villains and her hero, Mitchell detracts from the genuine potency of her women. This is a Lucia charged with complicated, grown-up emotions. Her middle-aged Lucia (Diana Damrau, pictured above with Charles Castronovo) has a stature and a character lacking in her classic teenage counterpart, and the alternative narrative offered here by her sex with Edgardo in Act I, followed by pregnancy and the miscarriage which prompts the mad scene, makes contemporary sense of the opera’s weaker sequence of events. Even substituting an active, onstage suicide (bathtub, razor blade) for Lucia’s traditionally non-specific offstage expiry is an innovation that feels natural – the equal and opposite reaction to the brutally protracted and discomfiting murder scene, pre-meditated by the anything-but-mad heroine.But it’s all complicated by direction that clutters a strong, simple concept with too many details. There’s confusion between the naturalism of the emotional drama and sets, and the symbolism of the action. The constant invasion of private, female space by male characters works on a symbolic level but jars in the context of such naturalistic interactions. Would a Victorian brother (however villainous) really burst into his sister’s bathroom? Would a Victorian woman really stride about in her shift with male servants watching? Would a shy suitor really accost his beloved in her bedroom?And then there are the constant distractions, the urgent dramatic sleeve-tugging that take your eyes away from the vocal action on the other side of the stage. Charles Castronovo (pictured above left with Damrau) may act as beautifully as he sings here, but I simply don’t know; my attention was constantly drawn away from his obediently parked figure (perched variously on some steps, by a monument, at a desk) and back to Damrau and Rachael Lloyd’s carefully drawn Alisa. Even with Lucia dead and all emphasis at last on Edgardo, Castronovo still finds himself upstaged, this time by a disproportionately noisy running tap. It’s a shame because, vocally, he and the male principals put on a strong showing, Ludovic Tezier balancing rough heft with clean lines to make a fine Enrico and Kwangchul Youn (pictured below) making Raimondo’s scheming dangerously plausible with the beauty and gravity of his delivery.Damrau doesn’t do fragile, and fortunately Mitchell doesn’t ask it of her. Instead we get a Lucia who is as vocally assertive as she is sexually, a rational woman momentarily maddened by shock and grief into fantasies that make for a psychologically compelling mad scene. Mitchell choreographs the action so as to make sense of the coloratura as musical substance, not embellishment, and if there’s a slightly gripped quality to her top notes it’s the only flaw in Damrau’s delivery. Daniel Oren conducts as though directing traffic, unyielding in his accompaniment of singers, and lumpen of gesture, but fails to derail some quality singing.Mitchell’s Lucia deserves much more than the knee-jerk booing it got on opening night. Thoughtful, if strident in its agenda, it has plenty to say, and finds an emotional violence and anger that’s as rare as it is authentic. It would be interesting to see what changes a revival might bring, whether the director might relax some of her dramatic grip on the piece and let the score do just a little more of the talking. The trouble with giving voice to the unvoiced is that you inevitably end up putting words in their mouths. And Mitchell has no shortage of words.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/lucia-di-lammermoor-royal-opera,4
236,"The Importance of Being Earnest, Royal Opera, Barbican",The Importance of Being Earnest,Royal Opera,2016-03-30,David Nice,"Some new operas worth their salt work a slow, sophisticated charm, but the handful that holler ""masterpiece"" grab you from the start and don't let go. Gerald Barry's shorn, explosive Wilde – more comedy of madness than manners – was so obviously in that league at its UK premiere in 2012, and has kept its grip in two runs of Ramin Gray's similarly against-the-grain production, now removed from the currently-closed Linbury Theatre at the Royal Opera House to the wider stage of the Barbican Theatre. It's still one of the few hysterically funny operas in the repertoire. The more you perceive its method, the more you're awed by the genius in its lunacy.In shedding two-thirds of the play without even aficionados much missing what's gone, and introducing his own meticulous comic – some would argue tragi-comic – sense of timing even in the silences and the notated spoken passages, Barry may even have made the work foolproof against any inept productions that may pop up as its popularity spreads around the world (Gray's, happily, is not in that category).This composer's art is analogous to the perfection of Richard Jones's theatre and opera direction. In Jones's Puccini Gianni Schicchi – another superlative operatic comedy in itself – no gag outstays its welcome. In the same way, Barry's Earnest never settles on any mode for too long as it moves between machine-gun, almost automata-like patter and paradoxically angular lyricism, dissonant energy and grinding banality (pictured above: Alan Ewing's Lady Bracknell turns her Ode to Joy into a dictator's rant).Fury seems to be the unifying tone, buzzing round each of the well-tempered duologues or ensembles. The Britten Sinfonia under Tim Murray took just a bit of time last night to dare, trumpet and horn lines chucking perfection in favour of stridency; Gray, on the other hand, wastes no time in summoning his semi-puppets from the front of the stalls up onto the stepped stage where the instrumentalists are very much part of the action. (We've recently had the ENO Magic Flute with its raised orchestra conjuring a singular complicity, and direct lines of communication with the audience, blazing under Mark Wigglesworth's baton). Franz Peter David's lighting is as much a participant as anything else in this total work of meticulously choreographed anarchy.The full vocal ensemble, including the two rhythmically precise, dramatically important cameos – Simon Wilding's rude Lane/Merriman and Kevin West's Canon Chasuble – has perfected its interplay since last time; as before, each principal character is a distinct personality. The girls are now true perfection: Claudia Boyle, previously another plucky Victorian maiden in Mike Leigh's ENO G&S and here the only newcomer to the main gang of six, is a cut-glass high-soprano Cecily (though in a generally clear delivery of the text, don't expect to make out the words ""They have been eating muffins"" on a high A).Her megaphoned spat with Gwendolen, a clipped duel to the death even before revelations sour relations, now has the most perfect Wildean dialogue you'll ever hear from Stephanie Marshall (pictured left); you wouldn't see a better Miss Fairfax on stage. As often as I've gone over the scene on the recording of the Barbican UK premiere, not least for students, the smashing of 40 plates and the percussive interruptions still make me weep with laughter.You probably wouldn't find a better John/Jack to deal with Barry's high-lying tenor writing than Paul Curievici, either. The Monty Pythonesque silly walk/hornpipe Gray asks him and Alan Ewing's pinstriped Lady Bracknell to execute could fall flat in a less accomplished singer-actor's hands (or feet). Ewing plays it straight until Lady B's ""version"" of Schiller's Ode to Joy erupts in fascist yelling.Benedict Nelson's Algernon makes a good laid-back foil to Curievici's friend/brother. ""I like his hair so much,"" as Boyle sings in Pucciniesque rapture at the end of a typically compact scene where the very name of Algernon sets off a horrified, brilliant orchestral riff each time (only half of it for ""Algy""). Marshall's spasms at ""Jack"" (I don't remember them from first time around) are one of the funniest things in a laugh-out-loud evening. To complement the basso profundo of Ewing's Lady, trailing inky-black instrumental depths and dissonant jabs, we have the inimitable contralto tones of Hilary Summers as Miss Prism – suitably not quite with us in the empty rustic idyll, an expressive face made for comedy and the vital icing on the cake in the denouement (pictured below).The question often arises as to what a non-English-speaker or anyone unfamiliar with the play might make of Barry's setting. I'd argue that unlike Shostakovich's The Nose, which is a music-drama incomprehensible without knowledge of the text, there's enough going on here to give musical pleasure, or pain, throughout, from the pre-recorded piano frenzy at the start, played by Barry himself, through to the smashing of the last eight plates on a fierce final crescendo. You may even come out humming something as catchy as the Act III Prelude with its air of post-coital tristesse (and ""Auld Lang Syne"" too, of course). It's a virtuoso piece as much for the players – who also have to participate vocally – as the singers. As I said, you know a masterpiece when you hear one, and the operatic Importance is here to stay.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/importance-being-earnest-royal-opera-barbican,5
237,"Written on Skin, Barbican",Written on Skin,Barbican,2016-03-20,alexandra Coghlan,"You learn a lot about an opera in concert. Free from directorial and design intervention, the music can and must do it all. What is good is amplified, and what’s weak exposed. When that score is as psychologically rich and texturally varied as George Benjamin’s Written on Skin, the clarity of a concert performance can actually feel like a gain rather than a loss.Which isn’t to belittle either Katie Mitchell’s original staging for the Aix Festival, or the work at the Barbican last night of director Benjamin Davis, who creates an allusive semi-staging within the significant restrictions of the Barbican Hall. But Benjamin’s score is so self-sufficient that it needs no help to etch its story deep into its audience.The story has the same fable-like simplicity that gives Benjamin’s Into the Little Hill its elegant architecture. A love triangle sets a woman between two men – her husband, The Protector, and The Boy, an artist invited into their home. Control and authority clash with passion and anarchic freedom, and the results are brutal. A trio of angels (Victoria Simmonds, the excellent Robert Murray, and Tim Mead) watch the action play out with dispassionate interest.Benjamin’s large orchestra dwarfs his cast of just five, but it’s a balance that reflects the dramatic responsibility of the instrumental music – poured into the spaces between Martin Crimp’s pared-back poetry. So when The Protector wheedles and needles The Boy into making him a book it’s the cellos that whine; when Benjamin reaches for an equal and opposite sound to the reedy purity of a countertenor he produces a bass viol; when he looks for a sonority to denature the romance of the harp he finds a guitar, and when Agnès finds herself driven to the brink of madness by her husband’s scheming it’s a glass harmonica, with its eerie echoes of Lucia, that flutters like the pulse at her temple.Benjamin shifts the orchestra’s centre of gravity, setting it unusually low. The music is heavy with violas, and added to the prominence of low woodwind and brass this anchors even the flightiest shrieks of high strings and flutes, giving an apparently slight tale roots that go deep. This textural stability allows the composer to play more freely, shifting between the harmonic certainty of The Protector's early phrases and the ambiguity of The Boy’s, with their fluid relationship to harmony and tonality.Benjamin himself (pictured below, at a Madrid performance ©Javier del Real, Teatro Real) conducted the Mahler Chamber Orchestra at the work’s 2012 premiere, and they return here alongside original cast members Barbara Hannigan and Christopher Purves (pictured above right). With an extended international tour of the opera already many months underway, last night’s performance was built on deep foundations. This is music that has been lived in, and it shows in the emotional and musical risks taken.The central trio of Purves, Hannigan and Tim Mead as The Boy are all but unimprovable. Mead makes a chilly seducer, magnetic but horribly impassive. It’s a physical performance that’s the twin of his vocal delivery, which brings both Brittenish purity and Baroque power to bear on music that’s tainted even as it is exquisite. His duets with Hannigan are indecently sensual, sparking harmonics that ripple back through the orchestra. Hannigan herself is the perfect woman-child, by turns obstinate and ecstatic, bringing a muscularity to Benjamin’s high-lying writing that refuses to melt into bland beauty.But it is Purves you can’t take your eyes off. The subtle rhetoric of his delivery is a marvel. The notes are just the start of expressive details and shading that render this tyrant disquietingly human. It is he who leads the orchestra into its sudden, cataclysmic flares of sound – moments where Benjamin treats his whole ensemble as a percussion section, striking and shaking them – and matches them in the heft of his anger, his violence.Benjamin has always been a miniaturist by instinct, working in detail but not necessarily in scope. In Written on Skin he retains all his concision, his immaculate restraint, but adds an emotional thrust that, even four years on from the premiere, still startles. He and Crimp return with a brand-new work for the Royal Opera House in 2018, and it’s hard not to be very excited about what that might bring.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/written-skin-barbican,5
238,"Boris Godunov, Royal Opera",Boris Godunov,Royal Opera,2016-03-15,David Nice,"Russian bells and spinning tops dominate Richard Jones's predictably unpredictable take on Musorgsky's saga of a conscience-stricken Tsar. Latter-day purism tends to insist on the composer's seven-scene 1869 original – possibly for economic more than artistic reasons – and this two-hour-plus, interval-free whizz through seven years of Russian history is the most faithful to the first score I've heard. It's also a first for the Royal Opera, which has preferred the much longer, so-called 'supersaturated' combination of two versions in its long-running Tarkovsky production preceding Jones's.Musorgsky's sweeping 1872 rewrite lends more humanity to the hard, if not exactly cold, music-theatre original. Given the original's adamantine tone, Jones, a splendid cast and Antonio Pappano moving with feline suppleness through what can seem stolid in less vibrant hands like Gergiev's make this an impressive, resonant evening, if only occasionally a moving one.Jones takes his cue for the pervasive spinning-top image from one line in which scheming boyar Shuisky jerks Boris's guilt into actionClarity and imagination are rigorously welded. Russian audiences would always have known from the start that Boris Godunov, courtier of Ivan the Terrible, was deemed guilty, at least by the rash of 19th century historians, of murdering the rightful child-heir to the throne, Ivan's son Dmitry. Western audiences have to wait until the middle of Scene Three for chronicler-monk Pimen to tell us so (the Pushkin play from which Musorgsky selected and adapted makes it clear at the beginning). What we first see in the golden-yellow upper room onstage is a creepy masked figure as red-headed Dmitry playing with his spinning top while assassins move in to slit his throat. Bryn Terfel's already troubled Boris sits below waiting for news of the murder.The ritual killing is to be replayed again and again, Boris's conscience made manifest. The top, seen on the dropcloth before the music starts, is crucial: Jones takes his cue from one line in which scheming boyar Shuisky jerks Boris's guilt into action by mentioning the toy clasped in the dead boy's hand. Just so did the director's unforgettable Wozzeck in a baked-bean factory develop from a casual word about the bullying doctor's prescribed diet for the harassed soldier.There's further irony and horror in Boris's own son, the Tsarevich Fyodor, being a redhead (and all the stronger as sung by treble Ben Knight rather than the usual mezzo in trousers). Reluctant monk Grigory Otrepiev – David Butt Philip, ringingly clear of tone and diction in his limited 1869 role – is the other lookalike, who plays on his age and hair colour to enlist help in Lithuania as a ""false Dmitry"". The hair gives us a thread through the two substantial actions in which the nominal protagonist Boris is absent.The first two scenes see Jones at his most hieratic, with the chorus in straight lines, though nothing like as rigidly or boringly so as they were in Calixto Bieito's ENO Force of Destiny. The Russian people outside the Novodevichy convent waiting for Boris to accept the crown of Monomakh are in dark colours against black bell-imprinted walls while the boyars in identical grey jackets and maroon trousers pace the golden room above (pictured above). This split stage is designer Miriam Buether's idée fixe, and it works superbly throughout. The bottle greens and blacks are replaced by brilliant fancy dress for the nobles at the coronation – costume designer Nicky Gillibrand's big moment – where it's Boris who is most likely to step out of line, shadowed above as in Eisenstein's Ivan the Terrible and plagued by the action that gave him the throne in the first place.Pimen's monologues in the Chudov monastery can be tedious, despite his big and noble melody. No chance of that given Ain Anger's expressive if still rather youthful-sounding bass and the ocular proof of his work in portraits of Tsars Ivan, Fyodor, Boris and, unfinished, the young Dmitry. The visuals help a potentially sticky patch in the same way that apprentice David's listing of the song rules in Jones's Mastersingers had pictorial help, and Butt Philip's urgency moves the scene along, too (pictured above).He's definite in his impatience and nervousness at the inn on the Lithuanian border, too. As Pushkin's verse gives way to prose, you'd expect a looser, more naturalistic scene, but Jones keeps the symmetries with his inkeeper's bar, multiple portraits of Boris almost Hinduised on the walls and police gathering in the upper room. The realness here comes from John Tomlinson's vagabond monk Varlaam, his ""Song about Kazan"" hilariously accompanied on the spoons – genius idea – by sidekick Missail (Harry Nicoll, both pictured below). It's a pity Varlaam's puns and rhymes aren't reproduced in the supertitles; without them the role stands little chance of being really funny in itself – it never was in the Tarkovsky production – but Tomlinson, an imposing Boris of recent years, pulls off the feat of modest lovability and is still the most resonant bass of the evening.Terfel gets his big chance to reassert the centre of gravity in the Kremlin Apartments scene – very much the loving father, the troubled ruler and the violent reactor to Shuisky's scheming (John Graham-Hall was chosen for his acting abilities, but we really need more tenor tone when this character shows his claws). From now on, the show is essentially his, and admirably he doesn't approach the usual ham in hallucinations of the dead child, though there's a bit of eye-rolling in the final scene. The crucial meeting between highest and lowest, Tsar and Yurodivy (or Holy Fool), is a tiny bit blunted by the usually splendid Andrew Tortise sounding a bit English, and not quite plaintive enough, though he does the OCD gestures impressively.Last obstacles in Musorgsky's monologue-laden drama come in what here, as originally intended, is the endgame, the death of Boris (pictured right). Jones overcomes them with a mobile group of boyars, the power-play implicit in Pimen's fatal last appearance and the total concentration on father and son in a pool of bright light. Shostakovich objected to the major-key consolation that follows Boris's death. Let's just say that Jones doesn't see it as such, and that Grigory-as-Dmitry makes a final, quietly devastating appearance to provide the expected symmetry.I've left more about the conducting until last, but Pappano's urgency and rough-edged vividness, keenly anticipated in the Royal Opera Orchestra's blistering concert performance of the original St John's Night on a Bare Mountain, keep the music-drama afloat. There's so much detail in Musorgsky's rough-hewn orchestration, especially in Varlaam's Kazan number, and the strings ooze crocodile tears in many of the glissandi. The strange splendour of the orchestral bell music, undercut by Boris's first mental replay of Dmitry's murder, is compounded by lashings of the real thing and excellent chorus work in the Coronation Scene.Gems of the 1872 version, the children's and Nurse's songs and Boris's revised, Verdian monologue – both present in Tarkovsky's long-lasting predecessor – would have given us the crucial aural breathers just when it all gets too knotty, but the consistency is total. The shocks and direct emotions may be rather few in the original version, but chances are that red-headed, top-spinning boys having their throats cut may haunt our dreams long after this production is over.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/boris-godunov-royal-opera,4
239,"Ariodante, Britten Theatre, Royal College of Music",Ariodante,Britten Theatre,2016-03-09,alexandra Coghlan,"The London Handel Festival is back, and instead of ploughing their usual furrow of rarely-seen works, this year’s opera is a classic. If the rest of Ariodante doesn’t quite live up to the promise of its two often-excerpted arias (“Dopo Notte” and “Scherza Infida”), then it’s still a deeply satisfying evening of music, with a large cast perfect for showing off the talents of the Royal College of Music’s student performers.James Bonas’s production is a moody affair, distilling Handel’s Scottish setting down to its emotional essentials. There are hints of snow and of the original sea-coast in Molly Einchcomb’s post-apocalytpic designs that pivot around a series of moving curtains (effective but criminally noisy), creating a wonderfully fluid sense of place. Dark browns, blues and blacks, all flecked with mud, give this tented space an edge, and even the trees are fragmented – amputated boughs suspended gracefully in the air.The cast, decked out in what looks like the entire A/W 15/16 Brora collection, are all dreadlocks and natural fibres – a royal court turned rogue pack of live-by-their-wits adventurers. It’s a context – on the edge of life and death – that makes some sense of the extremity of a plot that condemns its heroine to death for a single supposed transgression, and climaxes in a bloody duel.Laurence Cummings drives the performance with all his usual verve and rhythmic attack, supporting a cast who, if not the finest we’ve seen at the festival in recent years, certainly give the audience plenty to look forward to in opera’s future. I can’t remember the last time I went to a Handel opera and came away most excited about the tenor, but Peter Aisher (Lurcanio) is an exception. It helps that Handel writes some of his most athletic and attractive music for this role of the warrior Ariodante’s brother, but it’s Aisher who seizes these challenging coloratura showpieces and really sells them. Added to his vocal agility is a lovely baritonal colouring to the voice, and even tone-colour from top to bottom.Although not the slightest bit warrior-like, either in vocal tone or physicality, Katie Coventry’s Ariodante is bewitchingly charming. There’s a youthful ardour and intensity to her, an emotional directness, that will make for a natural Cherubino or Dorabella, but which doesn’t quite carry off Handel’s rather sterner hero. Vocally it’s all there though, and a delightfully frisky “Dopo Notte” makes the most of her lighter, more athletic approach to the music. Arguably more suited to the role in terms of tone, Elspeth Marrow makes rival lover Polinesso a really nasty piece of work, but villain’s music does seem to sit a little low for her, hampering projection at times. A fine balance for so many upper voices, Simphiwe Simon Shibambu’s King (pictured above left) makes you want to hear more – an ailing, Fisher King-type figure, whose own tragedy is only glimpsed.Galina Averina’s Dalinda is a real find, reinventing herself vocally as she moves from innocent woman-child to vengeful scorned lover. Her “Neghittosi or voi che fate?” is blisteringly rageful and completely assured. Where Bonas’s direction leaves some cast members pacing back and forth without obvious intent, she manages to invest each movement with authority and character. As Ariodante’s wrongly-accused Ginevra, Sofia Larsson is less consistent. “Il mio crudel martoro” was a triumph, and the latter, tragic half of the opera was generally much more successful than the early joy, which exposed a lack of vocal control. Her coloratura never quite felt secure, and both tone and pitch proved wayward at speed.Later on in the festival there’s a chance to hear operatic rarity Berenice, as well as oratorio Alexander Balus – both with superb casts. But, even though Ariodantes do come round rather more frequently, it’s worth making time to see this fine show, especially in a theatre that suits this material so well.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/ariodante-britten-theatre-royal-college-music,4
240,"Iphigénie en Tauride, English Touring Opera",Iphigénie en Tauride,English Touring Opera,2016-03-06,David Nice,"Gluck's two operas about the daughter of Agamemnon saved from sacrifice only to serve as priestess-butcher herself have found their level on the contemporary operatic stage. Not that the handful of UK productions or their casts in recent years have quite matched the pared-away beauty of his peculiar classicism: neither Iphigénie en Aulide at Glyndebourne nor the Royal Opera's Iphigénie en Tauride have stuck in the memory, and I doubt if ETO's brave shot at the second opera will either.Iphigenia's tortuous path to reunion with brother Orestes finally calms the chain of murders triggered by her putative sacrifice – her mother Clytemnestra's axing of Agamemnon, Orestes' revenge upon his mother – with the redemption of romance, as if they need not have happened after all. There is a degree of redemption here, too, for ETO's General Director James Conway, set and costume designer Anna Fleischle and lighting designer Guy Hoare after their unfortunate King Priam. Fleischle's stairways, platforms and ramps now draw the eye towards goddess Diana's sacrificial altar space, variously and beguilingly lit by Hoare, while blood, water and earth frame this perfect design for classical tragedy. It all looked especially handsome in the Hackney Empire, first stop on the ETO tour, last night.Conway, too, is mostly better with groupings than he was in the topsy-turvy, cluttered Priam, helped by a strong, select chorus, though the hugger-mugger of Scythians dragging on the new arrivals to their barbarous realm obscures Orestes to concentrate upon some rather half-hearted knife cuts inflected upon his poor mate Pylades. There are some strong touches: Iphigenia's backstory as a young virgin slated to be slain by her own father so the Greek fleet could sail to Troy justifies a plucky little girl, Pepper Cometti in Hackney, to sing the dea ex machina role of Diana, exonerating all before sploshing around in her wellies in the water at the back of the stage (the scene pictured above).The director could have worked harder on body language and gesture. While Catherine Carby knows exactly what to do to express Iphigenia's pain and dignity, using the French language to heighten the plangency, the men don't properly connect – least of all with the ETO Orchestra, natural in simplicity but hardly fizzing with energy under Martin André when the action requires it. A period-instrument guttiness would have served Gluck's directness better, and it was a shame the usually piercing oboe solo in the climactic ""O malheureuse Iphigénie"" soon disappeared beneath the string textures.Carby, then, holds the compact drama together, with help from Gluck's directness and refusal to dwell on the arias stitched so seamlessly into the music-theatre fabric. A mezzo with an imperfect top in the soprano realm is always going to be challenged, but it's worth it for the vibrant warmth of Carby's middle register, oddly reminiscent of Diana Montague, a fine exponent of the role. Grant Doyle pushes Orestes' anguish too much, as if he were a Flying Dutchman faced with a dense orchestra, though he's dignified when it comes to the inevitable sacrifice. The role of devoted friend Pylades – deep gay love, the only physical kind in the drama, is not shirked in this production – needs a high-tenor limpidity, and John-Colyn Gyeanty's inability to spin a line proves a serious drawback here, though he can do intensity (the loving friends pictured above left). Craig Smith as Thoas needs physical loosening up; the way he stands doesn't help vocal production.It's true that Gluck and his librettist Guillard don't make it easy for us to feel deep emotion for their characters. Everyone is expected to know them as the archetypes of Greek tragedy, and the singers need to express their states of being immediately. The crucial sympathy is missing here; pity and terror, especially for Orestes' pursuit by the Furies, remain unstirred. That makes the opera a hard sell for audiences around the country, and I can't help feeling that Conway's persistence with the rare and not always rich – Donizetti and Haydn falling into the latter category – isn't exactly going to win a love of opera at its most searing from first-time operagoers in the regions. But maybe the Don Giovanni, playing in repertory with this Iphigénie and Donizetti's Pia de' Tolomei, will make amends.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/iphig%C3%A9nie-en-tauride-english-touring-opera,3
241,"Akhnaten, English National Opera",Akhnaten,English National Opera,2016-03-05,alexandra Coghlan,"What a load of balls. No, seriously. Globes, orbs, moons, suns, juggling balls, beach balls, er balls balls: if it’s spherical and pregnant with symbolism then you’re bound to find it somewhere on the props table for English National Opera’s Akhnaten. At the centre of Phelim McDermott’s new production of Philip Glass’s opera is a troupe of jugglers. If that idea appals you it’s worth suppressing your doubts, because it turns out that the greatest trick on display in this mesmerising show isn’t ball skills at all, it’s conjuring – dramatic sleight of hand of the most sophisticated, bewitching kind.ENO and Philip Glass have a long history, and recently McDermott – artistic director of theatre company Improbable – has become a regular part of it. But where his Perfect American couldn’t find that Disney magic, and his Satyagraha stumbled under the weight of too many ideas, his Akhnaten has tapped into something very special, all the more so for being completely unexpected.If the juggling sounds like a gimmick, then it doesn’t read at all like one in a production that takes a Robert Wilson approach to visual ritual and repetition. Performed by Gandini Juggling, the elegant sequences of movement become a surprisingly expressive metaphor for the mystical power of Akhnaten’s new religion. We understand his fascination with the sun because we share it, unable to draw our eyes away from something we too are captivated by, but cannot fully grasp. Only very occasionally do we stray into Cirque du Soleil territory. A spontaneous burst of applause in Act II signals that thrills have briefly overpowered drama.The stage pictures that McDermott and designers Tom Pye and Kevin Pollard (sets and costumes, respectively) create here are startlingly lovely. Whether it’s the sun, flushing through the spectrum of colours during Akhnaten’s aria, or the loin-tighteningly sensual duet for Akhnaten and Nefertiti, weaving and winding themselves up in fleshy skeins of material during their duet (the natural heirs to Ligeti’s Spermando and Clitoria) there’s a loving care for detail here that makes the slow pace of movement and the gradual, incremental shifts of musical patterning a meditative delight rather than a frustration.It helps that, unlike Satyagraha, the repetitions and ritual of Akhnaten remain largely abstract (ghastly spoken text aside), free from the mystical pseudo-profundity that so exhausts in the earlier work. There’s religion, certainly, but no preaching. In many ways this third panel in Glass’s “portrait” trilogy is closer to Einstein on the Beach, though more musically fluid, more yielding in its ostinatos and (despite the lack of violins) more varied in its colours.Visuals glance towards Egypt without feeling bound by it, and the result blends metallic, industrial minimalism with richly textured fabrics and headdresses – the very model of a modern Egyptian Pharoah.Beguiling in his intensity, Anthony Roth Costanzo (pictured above right) makes a monarch worth converting for, Tiresias-like in his fluid sexuality. If his laser-point tone won’t be for everyone, bringing with it a certain sourness of pitch before the release of vibrato settles the note, there’s no arguing with the vocal power he brings, holding his own above even Glass’s thickest textures. But while his “Hymn to the Sun” is compelling, it’s in ensembles – the duet with Emma Carrington’s generous-toned Nefertiti, and the trio with Carrington and Rebecca Bottone’s radiant Queen Tye (pictured above with Zachary James) – that he really shines. Despite negotiating some ghastly English text, Zachary James has tremendous power and presence as the Scribe, translating this parable down the ages for us.The ENO chorus once again prove their worth, making the most of Glass’s monumental writing while singing in Akkadian and Hebrew and even doing a little elementary juggling. Conductor Karen Kamensek finds just enough space for poetry within the rigid architecture of Glass’s music, shaping a reading that never insists upon its own loveliness, and is all the more beautiful for that.Already the best-selling contemporary opera in ENO’s history, this Akhnaten is a timely reminder of just what the company is good at, and just how damn good they are at doing it. It’s an argument more powerful than any amount of figures or rhetoric for the ENO’s survival, and should be mandatory viewing at Arts Council England.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/akhnaten-english-national-opera,4
242,"Orlando, The English Concert, Bicket, Barbican",Orlando,The English Concert,2016-03-02,alexandra Coghlan,"Anyone who says Handel can’t do psychology should spend an evening with Orlando. Form, orchestration, even exit conventions are all reinvented or cast aside for a work of startlingly contemporary fluidity, where music is completely the servant of drama. Stripped back to little more than the score last night, in one of the Barbican’s very-semi-stagings, Handel’s emotional architecture was completely exposed, allowing us to see just how jaggedly inventive its lines really are.Which makes it all the more frustrating that, while stylish and efficient, The English Concert’s performance wasn’t just a little bit more Italianate, more willing to take the risks that might have sacrificed prettiness and order for excess and a passionate chaos equal to the score itself.It wasn’t a question of speeds – Bicket’s were, if anything, on the swifter side – more of instrumental rhetoric and variety of tone colour. Despite some wonderfully ardent work from the cellos, the orchestral playing tended towards the anonymous, briefly flaring into colour with the addition of horns, recorders or bassoon, but only seizing at the throat during the exquisite “Gia l’ebro mio ciglio” – Orlando’s aria of calm after the storm of madness, scored with outrageous daring just for viola duet (originally violette marine) and continuo. We’ve seen far less musical Handel from European ensembles at the Barbican recently, but in performances that – for all their rough patches – still had more spark.And this despite a really excellent cast. Singing the title role, Iestyn Davies gave us a mad scene of unsettling delicacy, drawing differences all the more disturbing for their subtlety between his moments of seeming calm and his murderous fury. Earlier, a blistering “Cielo! Se tu il consenti” showed the extremes of his coloratura agility, while “Gia l’ebro” reminded us that few countertenors can spin a longer legato line, or sustain it with such warmth and beauty. Just occasionally the role’s heavy demands on the lower end of the voice left Davies a little light in the balance, but it’s a small quibble considering the sheer scope of musicianship on show here.Carolyn Sampson (pictured above) – a soprano we don’t see enough on the opera stage – made a graceful Dorinda, vocally agile and adding a silvery sheen to the top of ensembles. Only the glorious trio that closes Act I “Consolati, O bella” blotted the landscape, Bicket’s sprightly speed denying the three singers the space to find the characterisation that speaks so clearly through the music. Sampson’s Dorinda – at her emotional nadir here – suffered most, denied the tragic weight to help anchor her more comic moments.Erin Morley’s Angelica was, likewise, a little dramatically lightweight. If thwarted love for her is enough to propel Orlando into the kind of frenzy Handel’s music paints then there has to be something more to her than pettish, pouting charm. Musically though it was a superb performance, blending beautifully with Sasha Cooke’s oddly uneven Medoro. Cooke’s is a voice with an exciting range of colours and some real heft to it, but too often here it tended to blurt, and frequently the ends of phrases were left ragged and unfinished. Kyle Ketelsen’s Zoroastro rounded off the small cast – bluffly sonorous, dispatching some of Handel’s finest arias for bass with precisionWelsh National Opera’s recent production gave us Orlando with plenty of drama but very little score, and now with the English Concert we get the reverse – a performance bursting with vocal skill but lacking in dramatic weight. Would it be greedy to ask for both from an opera house in the near future?",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/orlando-english-concert-bicket-barbican,3
243,"Nothing, Glyndebourne Youth Opera",Nothing,Glyndebourne Youth Opera,2016-02-27,David Nice,"Brand-new youth operas tend to fall into two types. One is hugely rewarding for the participants, a skill learned and a treasurable group experience to be remembered for the rest of their lives, as well as for their friends and family in the audience. The other, a rarer breed, does all that but also takes a gripping subject transformed by that strange alchemy of operatic setting, stunningly well performed by singers and players alike, and sears everyone who sees it with its special intensity. Nothing fits the latter bill like no other work of its kind I've seen.That's saying something if you bear in mind that Glyndebourne's education department has been blazing a trail since its inception by Katie Tearle in 1986, supporting its young team with the peerless forces of its stage crew, music staff and input from top directors, designers, conductors and composers. Stephen Walsh was similarly impressed by Orlando Gough's Imago in 2013. For this year's all too limited airing, David Bruce and his librettist Glyn Maxwell hit on a masterpiece. Danish-born Janne Teller's young adult novel of the same name asks the most powerful existential questions already being raised by children and adolescents – what or who am I, what is the meaning of life – through the medium of a superficially simple tale which has the qualities of timeless myth, yet is also rooted in the present. The 14-year-olds of Class 7A in a Danish provincial school find themselves discombobulated when strange Pierre Anthon leaves their number ""the day he realized that nothing was worth doing because nothing meant anything anyway"". He sits in a plum tree (Stuart Jackson pictured above right) like an old Greek cynic challenging his former classmates to find meaning in the form of precious objects which they sacrifice to a large pile; they decide, in the opera at least, that they'll cry when it all goes up in smoke because of their sacrifices' significance. The boundaries are smashed and language is blurred as the group egging-on mounts to ever more outrageous challenges. Mob violence in the face of the outsider's mysterious, maddening detachment makes a marvellous topic for an opera involving a large ensemble of schoolchildren, here led by five young professional singers straight out of music college and underpinned by an orchestra conducted by Sian Edwards, the Southbank Sinfonia, which sounds totally professional and yet contains many players as young as their counterparts onstage. The choruses and bit parts are marvellously singable, tonal even when something else more sinister is going on down in the pit, and though they start out with a shade too much hey-nonny-nonny pastoral innocence – and heaven knows young teens are never entirely that – they gradually metamorphose into a group anger which comes close to the visceral intensity of Peter Grimes.The solos, too, are variable as music, from a too-bland song for guitarist and Beatles fan Johan (the countertenor James Hall, flawless like his colleagues) via Rake's Progressy chamber arias meshing with beautiful woodwind writing for Pierre – full of Peter Quint-like vocal allure from tenor Stuart Jackson, not at all the yelling misfit of the book – and weak voice of reason Agnes (Robin Allegra Parton) to the devastating lament-into-mad-scene of poor Ursula (the very promising mezzo Marta Fontanals-Simmons) as she laments the disinterment of her dead dog.This is one of many areas where the libretto plays safer than the novel; Teller makes the ""sacrifice"" the much more horrifying one of the other kids digging up the coffin of Ursula's young brother to add to the pile (an old dog guarding its master's grave gets involved in the ritual too). Oddly Maxwell prefers to stick to stereotypes – all the boys at first choose superheros and action-men models to throw on the ""pile of meaning"", the girls select girly things – whereas Teller extends the participants to include an effeminate boy and a Muslim who gets beaten black and blue at home for having to hand over his prayer mat. This part of Sussex, needless to say, is less multi-culti than provincial Denmark, so the representation on stage is also less mixed, to put it mildly. Even so, the dramatic trajectory reaches shattering heights in Act II, and the teenagers give it everything they have, keenly directed by Bijan Sheibani of Emil and the Detectives fame. Bass-baritone Tristan Hambleton as Karl (pictured above in the centre), coalescing the forced offerings of a patriotic boy's flag and a religious kid's church crucifix, dominates with a dark malignancy as the compulsions peak in what essentially is a rape and a murder.Curiously, given music's avowed power to express ambiguity more powerfully than words, it's the novel which is more horrifically alluring in its fluidity. But Bruce manages to run a stylistic gamut without sounding too pastichey, even if he does virtually quote the trills of Zerlina's second aria in Don Giovanni and a strutting number from Stravinsky's Mavra. Pierre's cosmic vision that begins the opera and returns even more persuasively at a key point in the action, Wagner's oceanic pull via John Adams, evokes a music-of-the-spheres ""something"" rather than the avowed nothing. The contrasts widen between his obdurate solos and the mounting aggression of the group, paralleled in scenes on the Giles Cadle-designed revolving stage that move between the plum tree and the disused sawmill where the rites of passage are enacted. The epilogue (pictured above), which takes us beyond the eerily dominant Act II chorus of ""we heard about it; we were not there"", is deeply satisfying. Interesting: as I write I feel it hard to let go of the experience. We need to see it again, and soon. Bravo, Glyndebourne.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/nothing-glyndebourne-youth-opera,5
244,"Il Trittico, Royal Opera",Il Trittico,Royal Opera,2016-02-26,David Nice,"From working-class hell via convent purgatory to Florentine comic heaven, the riches of Puccini's most comprehensive masterpiece seem inexhaustible. In a production as detailed in its balance between the stylised and the seemingly spontaneous as Richard Jones's, first seen in 2011, there are always going to be new connections between the three operas to discover. Some things are stronger, some weaker second time around, but you still come away convinced that each work glows best in its original context, and that none should be prised away.Two of the three leading ladies are new to the revival, but the one who showed so much promise first time round gives the most unusual performance. Albanian soprano Ermonela Jaho confessed in a recent interview that last time she was learning the eponymous role of Suor Angelica, the nun confined by her family for the disgrace of an illegitimate child, more or less as she went, replacing the keenly-anticipated Anja Harteros at short notice, but that this would be a much more nuanced interpretation. You can say that again. This time so much was sung, as Italians would put it, con intimissimo sentimento, ""with the most intimate sentiment"", daringly quiet, not least most of the heart-rending aria ""Senza mamma"", in which the traumatised Angelica mourns over her dead son having died without a mother's consolation. So there's no question of mawkishness (in fact I've always found this tale of convent life and death devastatingly truthful, helped by the fact that Puccini consulted his sister, a nun, over detail, and that her colleagues all debated forgiveness over the suicide). When Jaho's Angelica lashes out, then, the power is all the greater. Contrition and humility don't come easily to this girl who's had to give up everything.Vocally, the sound can be cloudy, especially as contrasted with the bright ring of Lauren Fagan's Sister Genovieffa, surely an Angelica in waiting. But the fast vibrato which troubled Jaho last time is nowhere in evidence, and the top notes are incandescent. Angelica's central conflict with the rigid ""morality"" of her aunt, La Principessa, is more compelling than before. Anna Larsson cuts a handsome figure, and Jones's pure choreography, loyally realised by his excellent protégée Sarah Fahie, is at its strongest here in the contrast between stillness and decisive steps across the stage. The simple clutching of the heart as Larsson's Princess departs tells us that the woman isn't just a monster.Silence on stage, compounded by the quietest sounds from the Royal Opera Orchestra under Nicola Luisotti, can be even more devastating than the singing; Puccini's ineffable sense of timing and pace gives the cue. Though he always gets the players to colour beautifully, Luisotti can be rather over-indulgent with the purple passages, and too unrestrained in the thunder of the opening melodrama, Il tabarro (The Cloak). Fortunately Patricia Racette (pictured right with Lucio Gallo) as dissatisfied bargee's wife Giorgetta, a brave replacement for the luminous Martina Serafin, shows her usual excellent diction and mid-range clarity to ride the orchestra. The tone may not always be pretty, but her economical, definite acting style tells us all we need to know about this worn-down woman's passion for a better life. Her reactions carry the one-dimensional, not very lustrous Carl Tanner as her socially-aware lover Luigi. Seen above from the Royal Opera balcony, Ultz's set reveals its genius the better, with the black hole in the middle of the barge providing a suggestion of hell and a barrier between the lovers when observed, compounded by the central dark alleyway and the contrast between quayside and mooring. As before, Jones's choice of three different designers - Miriam Buether lights up a nun-run children's ward, John Macfarlane handles Italian bad taste - pays off superbly.Lucio Gallo's Michele is more powerful than before, but I'd still like to hear a dark bass-baritone in the role. And he has a problem with the two high Gs. The one in Gianni Schicchi doesn't matter so much, and having the same singer to play both central characters struck me this time: of course, it's the triumph of the working man, downtrodden and worn out in Il tabarro, resourceful enough to triumph over bourgeois prejudices in Schicchi. Surely this has to be the funniest of one-acters, all the stronger for Jones not overworking each gag (his revival director, reproducing every meticulous move in what must be a substantial book, is Benjamin Davis). If Jaho's Angelica encouraged gentle tears rather than barely-controlled sobs, this is a controlled riot fit for laughing out loud again and again.The clutch of grasping relatives out to do something about defunct Buoso Donati's will is much the same as before (though there's a sadness that Robert Poulton is no longer with us). It's a luxury to have Rebecca Evans and Marie McLaughlin as the garishly-clad Italian wives, ravishing in the seductive-grasping women's trio as they dress Schicchi up to impersonate Buoso - and McLaughlin does a lovely linguistic kick at the end of her whispered enticement to make Schicchi give her a share in the real goodies.Elena Zilio is back to steal the show with her redoubtable chest tones and rapacious inflections as old cousin Zita, and we have two delightful new young lovers to represent May versus September: Paolo Fanale as a sweet, spunky Rinuccio, bouncing the awkwardly-ranged hymn to Florence with perfect zest, and Susanna Hurrell making her main Royal Opera stage debut as Lauretta (pictured above with Gallo), managing to sing the penultimate line of ""O mio babbino caro"" in an impressive single breath even given Luisotti's over-lingering speed.This is where he seems at his least happiest. Pappano had the perfect measure of comic timing, Luisotti does not, yet at least, and there are a few hairy ensemble moments, not least the relatives getting a beat out of synch with the orchestra as they acclaim Schicchi and not to be persuaded back until the music comes to a temporary halt. Still, the way Schicchi pulls it off is sheer delight, the epilogue sung to Dante's bust worthy of the riotous applause Schicchi requests. The most uproarious comic opera of the 20th century, to be sure; and if you want to hear the best of the 21st so far, don't miss the Royal Opera at the Barbican next month in Gerald Barry's The Importance of Being Earnest.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/il-trittico-royal-opera,4
245,"Figaro Gets a Divorce, Welsh National Opera",Figaro Gets a Divorce,Welsh National Opera,2016-02-22,stephen Walsh,"The third of Beaumarchais’s Figaro plays, La Mère coupable, is a very different affair from the other two, in that it records actual adultery and its disastrous consequences (including Cherubino’s death in battle), as opposed to the largely comic innuendos and mistaken identities of The Barber and The Marriage. David Pountney’s libretto for Elena Langer’s new opera for WNO, Figaro Gets a Divorce, fuses this idea with elements from Horváth’s play of that name, which has the Almaviva entourage exiled by revolution, the Countess dying in poverty and the Count imprisoned for crooked business dealings. Even with some moderation of these sordidities it’s a pretty grim scenario, and it says a lot for Langer’s brilliance of musical ear and invention and the smooth excellence of Pountney’s staging that the work nevertheless achieves lift-off and escape velocity.The crucial borrowing from Beaumarchais is the pair of love-children, Angelica (the Count’s daughter by Barbarina) and Serafin (the Countess’s son by Cherubino), themselves in love but thought unable to marry because of a consanguinity that, in the end, is disproved. Along the way, Susanna goes off with a sleazy nightclub owner who turns out to be Cherubino back from a faked death, Figaro returns to barbering, and the whole entourage are manipulated by a sinister Major who is in effect Don Basilio turned double agent.The dreary and unsurprising political message, that forced exile is a nasty and dehumanizing business, is softened by a certain human depth of characterisation, drawing on aspects, especially, of Mozart; but this would cut no ice if Langer had failed to rise to a musical expression of these profundities. She hasn’t.Hers is in no sense music in the Mozartian mould, nor is it, for the most part, epic in the Brecht sense, though there are moments of artifice picked out in the naturalist gloom. Susanna and Cherubino have a dirty cabaret number, the Major sings a “Racketeering Song” while being shaved by Figaro. But these are mere incidents in a score that ranges astonishingly, yet coherently, through a battery of styles and techniques, from the fragmented glitter of the opening, through passages of a searching lyricism and dark intensity, dance, popular song, and a good deal else besides.The orchestration, with bright pitched percussion, sonorous and melodious writing for cellos and basses, athletic, scurrying wind, and fierce tutti chordings, is simply spectacular. But more important is that the orchestra responds to the action, reflects the characters and shares their music. From scene to scene (there are many), the score carries one along. Wagner called music drama the art of transition. He would have approved Elena Langer’s handling of this tricky skillPountney’s production is an affair of suitcases and overcoats, endless checkings in and out, the past displaced in a hostile present. Naturally there is a hotel bar, the one squalid consolation in this transitory life. In the distance is Castle Almaviva, the past in another form but, when you finally get there, a mental institution. We seem to have been here many times before; but then (you might say) we’re all exiles now.Ralph Koltai’s swivelling panels ease the journey and discreetly define the destinations: the mountain pass, the spa hotel, the rooming house, the cabaret, the barber’s saloon. Sue Blane’s costumes are, of course, modern, completing the sense of departure from that lovably artificial world of wigs and stays that gave birth to these characters and their tribulations.The singers, nevertheless, provide a link. Elizabeth Watts is still the Countess, and beautifully she sings, particularly at the opera’s high point, where she powerfully anathematises the Major’s inhumanity. Alan Oke (pictured right), Basilio in Mozart, is superbly repellent as the Major, ending up as yet another gender exile, a nurse in the mental home. David Stout is again Figaro, deprived here of his fix-it genius, sadder but wiser, though he does pull the trigger – perhaps unintentionally – on Cherubino (a countertenor, naturally: the admirably seedy Andrew Watts), who has been bedding his wife.  Marie Arnet is new and excellent as Susanna, her wit swallowed up by frustrated motherhood; Mark Stone is again the Count, now a broken figure with a stick and no money. Most interestingly, the Mozart Cherubino (Naomi O’Connell) and Barbarina (Rhian Lois) are reincarnated as their illegitimate children, with a pretty love duet, beautifully sung, of which Mozart himself would surely have been proud, though he might have regretted its lack of irony.Justin Brown conducts what seems a brilliant account of this impressive score, whose one fault is an occasional tendency to overpower. Elena Langer, a Muscovite by birth, is no particular advocate of multum in parvo. With Prokofiev and Shostakovich sometimes audibly behind her, minimalism is hardly her thing. And by the way there is no divorce. Susanna, pregnant by Cherubino, goes back to Figaro, and off they go to bring up a child not theirs, a new gloss on Mozart’s mistaken identities and damaged class structures.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/figaro-gets-divorce-welsh-national-opera,5
246,"The Marriage of Figaro, Welsh National Opera",The Marriage of Figaro,Welsh National Opera,2016-02-19,stephen Walsh,"From the more or less inconsequential wit and bravura of The Barber of Seville to the profound comic psychology, social nuances and unparalleled musical genius of The Marriage of Figaro, and from the silly antics of Sam Brown’s Rossini to the style and brilliant stage management of Tobias Richter’s Mozart, is a good lesson in music theatrical history played backwards. At the same time it's a reminder of the versatility of this great Welsh company, the adaptability of its orchestra and chorus, and the musical loss it’s about to suffer with the impending departure of its chief conductor, Lothar Koenigs.Koenigs has never been the most comfortable of musical directors. There have been tantrums and confrontations; his personal touch is school of Toscanini rather than Haitink. But for the past five or six years he has nevertheless been inspiring WNO to some of its best ever (and admittedly one of its worst ever) performances; and this Figaro, if not quite in the clouds, is certainly well above the treetops.A stylish polyphony of comic activity, with moments of penetrating stillnessApart from the virtuosity of the orchestral playing, its most striking feature is its velocity. Here and there – in the overture and Cherubino’s “Non so più” – the speed might seem excessive, though it never seems to trouble the singers very much, or the orchestra at all. More important is the lightness of touch, which certainly does communicate to the cast. Richter’s production, after some vacuous business about a play-reading during the overture, settles into a stylish polyphony of comic activity, interspersed with those moments of penetrating stillness that separate Mozart from all other buffo composers, using the whole of this big stage as well as, for brief but telling moments, the actual auditorium.It’s a staging that places its trust in the composer and librettist, touts no personal vision or philosophy, but concentrates on the sheer traffic that motivates the piece. Here Ralph Koltai’s designs, somewhat anonymous for The Barber, come into their own: precise, specific and practical, occasionally also beautiful, but above all geared to the elaborate choreography of scenes like the Act 2 finale, with its doors and windows and cross-dressing, and on the other hand the actual wedding, which needs, and gets, nothing but space. Sue Blane’s costumes likewise make no protest against the work’s idiom but simply abet its central idea of dress as both a form of social and sexual imprisonment and a means of escape.Like the Rossini, this Figaro is very strongly cast. Elizabeth Watts (pictured right), who has sung Susanna here before, seems to have found new and darker colourings in her voice, and she delivers “Dove sono” especially with heart-breaking intensity, while the Susanna here, the young Irish soprano Anna Devin, is suitably lighter and brisker, touching in “Deh vieni” (but then one needn’t be moved by its fake sentiment), and an alert, watchable actress. Naomi O’Connell is a boyish, soprano Cherubino, excellent in her way, though for me the voice needs stronger support in this role: pubescent, not choirboy.Of the genuine males, David Stout is an outstanding, resonant bass Figaro, terrific in “Non più andrai” – one of the best I can remember – and a robust, not too violent, foil to Mark Stone’s sometimes frighteningly aggressive but musically controlled Almaviva. Richard Wiegold skilfully converts his Rossini Basilio into the Mozart Bartolo, Alan Oke is a sparklingly malign Basilio (with alas no aria – saving himself, perhaps, for a big part in Figaro Gets a Divorce), and Susan Bickley, with aria, is an ideal Marcellina, turning from old bitch into loving mother without a flicker. Rhian Lois also catches the eye and ear as Barbarina.Like The Barber, the work is sung in English (Jeremy Sams’s clever, catchy translation), but with surtitles for some reason only in the set pieces. Since the main argument for opera in English is surely audience comprehension, one wonders why translate if titles are still necessary – as they certainly are, and not only in the arias. David Pountney, a longstanding fan of translation, argues on the other hand that English gives better communication between the singers. I wonder how much difference this really makes with modern professionals who know these texts so well. What it certainly does is alter the music, and not for the better.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/marriage-figaro-welsh-national-opera,4
247,"Ariodante, Scottish Opera",Ariodante,Scottish Opera,2016-02-19,David Kettle,"In the end, it’s all about the oranges. They adorn the programme that accompanies Harry Fehr’s intelligent new production of Handel’s Ariodante for Scottish Opera. More importantly, they’re prominent in designer Yannis Thavoris’s clinical steel-and-glass set, growing on carefully groomed bushes in six neat tubs, placed meticulously below warming light bulbs, protected from the gales and snow drifts outside by a wall of glass.They're a simple but highly effective metaphor in Fehr’s deeply unsettling production, which relocates Handel’s opera – originally set in an unrecognisible, age-old Scotland – further north, in some wintry, puritanical, fundamentalist military state, full of bowing servants and pristine uniforms, and with the motto ‘Trust in the Lord’ etched immovably into the walls.Those oranges look charming at first, tended and cherished by scuttling servants, but gradually serve to encapsulate the claustrophobic, artifical world that Fehr has created for the opera, one governed by its own rules that have more to do with dogma than with nature. In this sinister environment, Handel's Othello-like tale of deception, jealousy and revenge plays out almost as though among children, hothoused like those oranges in this strangely antiseptic but horribly fascinating environment, and knowing little except its rules.Fehr’s production is brave, unafraid of unsubtle imagery (a brief opening scene with two hanging bodies twitching on a gallows tells us all we need to know about this society), and very strong, both visually and conceptually. His cast is almost universally strong, too. Australian mezzo Caitlin Hulcup is convincingly boyish and baffled in the title role, a young lover mistakenly convinced he’s been wronged, with a broad vocal range (and particularly resonant lower notes) and a remarkably expressive performance of ""Scherza infida"", probably the production’s standout aria. Sarah Tynan (pictured above) is equally convincing as Ginevra, the leader’s daughter and Ariodante’s intended, disarmingly and slightly unnaturally beautiful in her immaculate robes and jewellery – who suddenly finds herself facing death after being accused of adultery. Tynan is clear and ringing with a bright soprano, and cracks up convincingly under the strain of it all.Neal Davies commands the stage as the community’s mostly benevolent leader, and tenor Ed Lyon gives a fine, nimble performance as Ariodante’s brother Lurcario. The one mystery, however, is the villain Polinesso, whom countertenor Xavier Sabata (pictured above) plays – inexplicably – as a kind of camp panto villan, with not-so-subtle nods and winks to the audience, throwing up all kinds of questions about the motivations behind his deceit. In the end, it just doesn’t add up.Conductor Nicolas Kraemer, making his debut with Scottish Opera, does a creditable, sprightly job in the pit, but it’s still a fair way off the crisp, incisive, shapely performances almost taken for granted from period ensembles. In the end, though, it’s the questions that Fehr’s staging raises that stay in the memory. And when those magical oranges are replanted to mark a return to the status quo at the opera's supposedly celebratory conclusion, you can’t help feeling – well, trapped. It’s a seductive nightmare that Fehr has created, populated by some fine actors and singers nonetheless.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/ariodante-scottish-opera,4
248,"Norma, English National Opera",Norma,English National Opera,2016-02-18,David Nice,"In the light of what follows, it's probably best to be clear that I'm completely behind the artistic side of ENO in rejecting a 25 per cent reduction of the chorus's annual salary, tied to a shorter season. A full-time chorus of this size is the heart of a big company – without it, no Mastersingers, no Grimes, no Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk. A creative alternative solution must be found. Musically matters stand stronger than ever, with the new regime's most recent hit being a transformation of what was originally a lame-duck Magic Flute. Production wise, this Norma is one of the old guard's poorer choices. The good news is that the old guard's casting actually saves it.There has to be one very strong reason for ENO putting on not terribly music-theatre-friendly hokum like the early-19th-century Italian bel canto operas sung in English: namely a soprano who can hold her own against the pricier stars available to the Royal Opera. The company's Lucia di Lammermoor painfully lacked a beating heart in Anna Christy's doll-like heroine. Now, though, the track record for engaging strong American singers which began this season with Patricia Racette's Katerina Izmailova and continued with Tamara Wilson's revelation of a Leonora in The Force of Destiny is crowned by Marjorie Owens as Bellini's Druid priestess who's broken her vestal vows (pictured below). In a double coup, her unwitting love-rival Adalgisa is every inch Owens's equal in the astonishing performance of mezzo Jennifer Holloway.The duets between these two ladies make or break any Norma and have a dramatic backbone that's otherwise lacking in Bellini's hit-or-miss opera by numbers: there's the tension that for a while they don't know they're backing the same shit as a lover, ignoble Roman Pollione, that Norma needs to reveal the two children by Pollione whom she's miraculously been able to conceal from the cult and that Adalgisa needs to convince Norma of her sisterly devotion. The second, and greatest, duet in Act II is also one of the few stretches where director Christopher Alden, in a production first seen at Opera North in 2012 (so ENO were warned), doesn't break focus with someone else flumping or crashing across the stage doing something inappropriate or unintelligible. In that respect you have to pity Valerie Reid as Norma's confidante and child-help Clotilde, at one stage staggering around with a sickle like a cartoon harpy of the French Revolution – the period in fact is mid-Victorian, ask not why – and Adrian Dwyer as Flavio, Pollione's similarly top-hatted sidekick, an arrogant over-present henchman doomed by Alden to a nasty but still rather risible end.Chief ""druid"" Oroveso for some reason manipulates the action for as long as he can, and has to hang around on stage way too often, but at least this gives the opportunity to James Cresswell (pictured below with Owens), more or less the resident company bass this season, to let rip with the magnificent timbre which he's been reining in as a believable (if also cultish) Sarastro. There's also much stumbling and fruitless aggression demanded from the chorus, who – it should go without saying these days, though the management is deaf to the fact – provide their usual irreplaceable company spirit in singing some rather dull numbers extremely well. Alden was right to bring them forward for a special second bow at the curtain call, but the roars which greeted their first had already spoken volumes.Set Bellini's fitful drama when and where you please, but give us a moon and a sacred wood, not just wood – the setting seems to be a large rural barn with dangerous farming implements hanging on one wall and a smithy below them– and daylight coming through two high, small windows. You know from the start you're not going to be rid of Charles Edwards's one-size-fits-all design – not a patch on his Royal Opera Elektra – or that giant phallic log with which only Holloway's Adalgisa has any meaningful relationship. Peter Auty, a clarion tenor from the start in a thankless role, has to straddle it (why?) and Owens needs to climb it to sit vatically on a precarious chair for what will forever be ""Casta diva"", her rather splendid Victorian dress covered with cult symbols billowing (rather handsome work there, all the same, from costume designer Sue Wilmington).Owens's first offstage recitative proclaimed a vibrato that could be worrying for the long bel canto lines, and some odd vowel modifications in the upper register for George Hall's well-fitting translation, but reservations dissolved within minutes of the great hymn to the moon. You know whether you're in safe hands or not when the climactic phrase rises to a top B and the soprano has to cling on to it, ff, before hitting the C and descending; not to lose pitch at this point shows a secure technique, and Owens has that in spades. She combines the near-impossible in the role – declamation fit for a Brünnhilde or Isolde and coloratura precision. You don't expect limpidity in this space, and neither Owens nor Holloway, when combining in liquid thirds, offer much of that, but their voices are a perfect match for each other, and without an equally strong Adalgisa the show is lost. Holloway, in other words, is its crucial lynchpin and saviour. Stephen Lord's conducting, riveting the attention and drawing unexpected colours from the ENO Orchestra in a prelude which we hardly notice isn't great music, supports and moves with his singers well enough, though lacking the last degree of Italianate rubato and natural gear shifts.At the end of the first act, Alden has his Norma sit there with an axe, as if we're going to move on to Strauss's Elektra after the interval. Of course it's shades of another Greek heroine, Medea, whom Bellini and his librettist Romani invoke as the wronged secret wife thinks of avenging herself on her man by slaughtering their children. She doesn't – no plot spoiler there – and she wastes the strong feminist stance of Adalgisa in rejecting the cad by wanting to return to him.Well, that's Italian opera; but if dramatic and musical truth flourish only fitfully in Bellini's best operatic shot, we've had our vision from the two great scenes of female sorority. And yes, ENO chose well in its voices yet again. Usually a poor production would knock a star or two off the singing, but in Bellini acting with the voice absolutely has to come first, and here it does. Now hurry up and sign the petition from 'the Spirit of Lilian Baylis' if you haven't already done so. This kind of collective energy can't be squandered; once it's diminished, it's lost for ever.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/norma-english-national-opera,4
249,"Dido and Aeneas, Armonico Consort, Theatre Severn, Shrewsbury",Dido and Aeneas,Armonico Consort,2016-02-15,Richard Bratby,"Spoiler Alert. It’s Act Three of Purcell’s Dido and Aeneas. The witches have done their worst, Aeneas is about to take ship, and the tenor Guy Simcock steps forward as the drunken sailor to sing what – as music director Christopher Monks has confided to us before the overture – will be his first solo role with Armonico Consort. At which point, the leader of the orchestra suddenly leaps up onto a chair behind him and starts belting out the sailor’s song himself, reeling tipsily about and fiddling all the while as Simcock slumps disconsolately back to the chorus.“Brilliant,” you think, laughing. “A bit school play,” counters your inner critic. Whereupon the Wikipedia entry in your brain obligingly points out that a school play is precisely what Dido and Aeneas is.That’s pure Armonico Consort. The group has a special knack for making first-rate performances of intensely serious music look like a lot of fun. This is the ensemble that introduced circus acrobats to Purcell’s King Arthur, and whose Handel pasticcio Too Hot to Handel was as smart, funny and effective as its title was groan-inducing. Two key figures in that project – countertenor William Towers and soprano Yvette Bonner (pictured below) – are on this short tour. Armonico Consort plays small venues, and has a lively ensemble spirit. But as the presence of Bonner and Towers plus soprano Elin Manahan Thomas demonstrates, its artistic standards are of the highest. This isn’t one of their larger projects. The first half of the evening is devoted to a straight concert performance of Pergolesi’s Stabat Mater, with the emphasis on straight. Monks does it with pretty much the smallest possible forces: string quintet plus harpsichord, with a theorbo for added continuo colour. There’s no reason why that shouldn’t work, and in other venues on the tour it may well come across vividly – Monks and his band certainly gave the appearance of playing with considerable verve. At Theatre Severn in Shrewsbury, though, much of the orchestral sound vanished into the black-draped stage. Manahan Thomas and Towers, standing well forward, projected more effectively into the theatre, and their performances were poised and expressive. Manahan Thomas’s voice took on a slightly boyish edge that rubbed exquisitely against Towers’s darker, more soft-edged sound in Pergolesi’s tear-stained duets.Then came Dido and Aeneas, “quirkily semi-staged” as Monks put it. Well, demi-semi-staged, maybe: this too was essentially a concert performance, with the singers wearing evening dress and carrying scores. Did that matter? More, perhaps, at some moments than others. With every principal except Bonner either playing more than one character or diving in and out of the chorus, even this relatively slight plot occasionally got tangled. Most of the time, though, the performances and the sheer spirit of the thing were enough to keep disbelief at bay. A bright-toned Eloise Irving (First Witch plus sundry more-or-less supernatural entities) hammed it up exuberantly; Towers’s voice felt almost too lovely for the Sorceress. Manahan Thomas was a smiling Belinda, while Gareth John as Aeneas travelled an impressive emotional distance over his few brief numbers. And at the centre of it all was Bonner’s Dido, creating an aura of nobility merely through the way she held herself on stage. A trace of a smile and a quick flick of the hair understatedly conveyed the onset of her fatal love – the impassioned richness of Bonner’s voice did the rest, and Dido’s great final lament, sung in a wonderful stillness, brought the whole performance into tragic focus. Amidst all the action, the orchestral balance felt less of an issue: Monks gave the dance rhythms a playful spring but let the music expand and sing as the emotion demanded. With just enough drama there to do the job, this was an hour of top-drawer Purcell, beautifully sung in a big-hearted spirit. Armonico Consort are touring this programme to Poole, Yeovil and Crawley: if you’re in the vicinity, you needn’t hesitate.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/dido-and-aeneas-armonico-consort-theatre-severn-shrewsbury,4
250,"The Barber of Seville, Welsh National Opera",The Barber of Seville,Welsh National Opera,2016-02-14,stephen Walsh,"The latest themed season from WNO, to add to their fallen women, Donizetti queens and what not, goes by the slightly worrying title (for anyone with a short attention span) of “Figaro Forever”, and consists of an operatic sequence derived from Beaumarchais’ three Figaro plays and ending with a new opera by Elena Langer partly based on the last of them, La mère coupable.That comes up next weekend. Meanwhile we’re getting Rossini and Mozart, both in new productions and sung in English. The three operas hardly amount to a trilogy (I’ve seen a run-through of the Langer piece); in fact anyone seeing all three is likely to be struck more by the incoherence of the series, which already exists to some extent in Beaumarchais. Rossini’s Barber is the last, and best, of the standard guardian-and-ward Italian farces (including Donizetti’s Don Pasquale), whereas Mozart’s Figaro is a more or less openly subversive political comedy. Langer’s very interesting work, also strongly if obliquely political, is actually a hybrid of La mère coupable and a 1930s gloss on that play by Ödön von Horváth called Figaro Gets a Divorce (Figaro lässt sich scheiden). I’m very much looking forward to this premiere, next Sunday.One might have expected Sam Brown’s production of The Barber of Seville to be concocted with one eye on the sequence of which it’s a part. The opera, though farcical, is tightly organised and stylistically consistent. Rossini and Mozart observe the unities, Langer does not. But this Barber is more in the tradition of laugh-a-minute, anything-can-happen slapstick pantomime, from the moment that Fiorello wheels his serenaders on in a wardrobe, to the moment when Almaviva and Rosina start stripping for a quick how’s-your-father while Figaro frets about their getaway.Figaro’s entrance through the auditorium is a genuine coupThere’s plenty more in this vein, sometimes sacrificing plot for effect. When Almaviva comes on disguised as Basilio’s replacement music teacher, but here disguised actually as Basilio, complete with guide dog and dark glasses (this Basilio is blind), one wonders whether Brown has understood the fake pieties and the delicious musical joke that goes with them. When Figaro, hiding in the piano, keeps lifting the lid during Rosina’s “Contro un’ cor,” it’s as if the director has forgotten whose side Figaro is on in the deception of Bartolo.Of course there are gems in the dross. Figaro’s entrance through the auditorium is a genuine coup, spectacularly managed by Nicholas Lester, who has the voice and personality to fill this big space from any angle. Blind Basilio – Richard Wiegold – is a fine thought, even if it makes nonsense of Bartolo (Andrew Shore) sending him off to find a lawyer at short notice; and his electronic dog should be patented – guaranteed no messes and only bites when told to.Ralph Koltai, now in his nineties, has designed a clever, functional, semi-abstract rotating set for Bartolo’s house, inside and out, vaguely suggesting a prison with Sevillian attachments (though Figaro reads his eponymous Paris newspaper), balconied and barred, not intimate but colourful and spacious. We may expect variants of this concoction for the other two operas. Sue Blane’s costumes are best described as eclectic, with Rosina as a Lola Montez femme fatale, Almaviva (in the first scene) a sort of boatered Fred Astaire, then billeting himself as Chief Scout: all brilliantly watchable if dramatically confusing and in the end, like the production, rather exhausting on the antennae.The cast, though, is mostly strong. Lester is a vocally as well as physically athletic Figaro, and a towering figure in his shiny scarlet trousers alongside Nico Darmanin’s diminutive, somewhat thin-voiced Almaviva. But the star turn is Claire Booth (pictured right), very much a soprano Rosina, supremely happy and precise in Rossini’s high-lying alternatim coloratura, challenged occasionally by the chest notes of what is, after all, a mezzo role, but always personable, easy on the eye, and above all clever at suggesting a certain vulnerability behind her quick-witted, minxish exterior. Shore and Wiegold are a loveable pair of schemers, Wiegold’s “Calumnia” underplayed by the usual standards of crazed rumour-mongering but musically none the worse for that. The Berta, Rosie Hay, gets her aria and makes it well worth hearing.James Southall conducts briskly, perhaps too consistently mezzo-forte to forte, and not always kindly where Kelley Rourke’s hyper-modern translation raises mild obstacles to the vocal flow. The chorus also do well, as ever, but are blandly directed, doing nothing as serenaders bar taking their money, while Almaviva cavorts with a non-operative one-man band kit strapped to his back. Whatever this tells us about modern unionism and the decline of the aristocracy, it’s not much help to Rossini.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/barber-seville-welsh-national-opera,3
251,"The Magic Flute, English National Opera",The Magic Flute,English National Opera,2016-02-06,alexandra Coghlan,"“We are at a time of present crisis.” When Sarastro addressed his boardroom of business-suited acolytes last night, there can’t have been many in the Coliseum whose thoughts didn’t turn to English National Opera. Even by the standards of a company that has spent most of its history fighting for survival, 2015 was a year of unprecedented difficulty. Whether crisis becomes catastrophe remains to be seen, but there couldn’t be a more emphatic portent of success, a better-timed metaphor, than this Magic Flute. Frankly a bit of a dud on its first outing back in 2013, it has been transformed by ENO’s new music director Mark Wigglesworth into something rich and deliciously strange.Simon McBurney, theatre’s magus-in-chief, should always have been a good fit for Mozart’s phantasmagorical fantasy. Perhaps it was the unusual restrictions and demands of the opera house that stymied things last time round, but true to the director’s process of meticulous devising, revising and workshopping, this first revival is a different creature to that flat, heel-dragging evening.Where Nicholas Hytner’s Flute gave us charm and David McVicar’s Royal Opera production brings beautiful stage-pictures, McBurney’s is pure invention. It’s a bold imagination that takes a work beloved for its magic and strips that all away, exposing the nuts and bolts of theatrical illusion, from Foley artists and videographers (positioned in full view of the audience), to the orchestra itself, raised up from the pit and on show. It takes an even greater imagination to pull back the theatrical curtain and somehow still sustain the illusion, all the greater for the new complicity of the audience.From Finn Ross’s elegantly manipulated video designs and Matthieu Maurice’s vivid soundscapes to Robin Beer’s delightfully naïve chalk projections, we’re bombarded with sensation. If that sensory excess, coupled with the complications of Mozart’s plot, occasionally proves distracting, it also generates an energy that helps propel this baggy drama.But even this visual charge is nothing to the heat coming off Wigglesworth’s orchestra. From the nervy, dangerously swift Overture to the final chorus, he keeps the pace up throughout, while still finding space for moments of musical contemplation all the more ecstatic for their rarity. Lucy Crowe’s rapturous “Tamino mine” will stay in the ears for a long time, and Allan Clayton’s “Portrait"" Aria (Clayton pictured above, with Eleanor Dennis, Catherine Young and Rachael Lloyd as the Three Ladies) is just the start of an evening of lyrical, generously projected beauty. The raised orchestra makes for a more prominent instrumental balance, but while we gain colour and some gorgeous shading, Wigglesworth’s careful balancing ensures we lose little from the singers.In Crowe and Clayton the production has gained immeasurably, both vocally and dramatically – lovers whose uncomplicated sincerity carries off their sudden courtship, whose sweetness is tempered by Peter Coleman-Wright’s bluff Papageno. While the production doesn’t entirely convince me that an older Papageno is an improvement on the usual thirty-something (and reducing a role with such fine music to character singing isn’t ideal), Coleman-Wright brings bags of personality and some unexpectedly fine keyboard skills to his bird-catcher. James Creswell’s Sarastro (pictured above with Crowe) is a cult-leader whose singing could convince anyone to follow – a fine foil for Ambur Braid’s strident but efficient Queen of the Night, whose bitter venom infects even her music. Only Stephen Jeffreys’s translation still chafes in its attention-drawing archaisms and verbal fuss, a layer too far in an already heavy-laden production.Mozart’s flute may enchant the most dastardly of villains, but its magic is as nothing to the sleight of hand that Mark Wigglesworth has performed with this glorious revival. Now we can only wait and hope that he can pull off the same trick with the ailing ENO itself.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/magic-flute-english-national-opera-0,4
252,"The Devil Inside, Peacock Theatre",The Devil Inside,Peacock Theatre,2016-02-05,David Nice,"""I wish I had money,"" exclaims the weak-willed hero of Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress and, hey presto, the devil appears to strike a deal. Auden and Kallman didn't have the last word on Faustian-pact librettos. Now writer Louise Welsh and composer Stuart MacRae, successful collaborators already on the award-winning Ghost Patrol, have had the bright idea of turning a fiendishly clever short story by Robert Louis Stevenson, The Bottle Imp, into an updated operatic subject.The Devil Inside has a gripping plot - especially if, like me, you hadn't read either story or synopsis in advance - and is flawlessly presented by a small team, shared between Scottish Opera in Glasgow, where the opera recently had its premiere, and Music Theatre Wales. Four singers, 14 instrumentalists and a conductor power ahead on all fronts.First question, if this touring production is to have a longer life: does the music fit the subject-matter? Absolutely. Fidgety and spangled from the start, the superb small orchestra under Michael Rafferty punches above its nominal weight, as in the chamber operas of Britten. The colours are often bewitching, especially in the eerie music for harp and the deflating chromatic descents of lower instruments, and McRae has more than a few hockety ideas as catchy as Britten's.It has to be said that they're more often in the orchestra than in the voices; the singers have to grapple hard with writing that isn't exactly angular, but doesn't always fit the pithy text like a glove. The relatively few lyric moments are welcome but can feel contrived. Nicholas Sharratt as Richard, one of two lost hikers kicking off all the trouble in the mansion of a weird old man - Steven Page, commanding as ever (pictured above) - who wants to flog his green-glowing bottle complete with wish-granting imp inside for fifty dollars, has an arietta about what he'd do with the money rather too obviously flagged up. Baritone Ben McAteer's James gets big moments in the rich-financier scene, which came to a halt last night as the lights went off in the pit. Professional to a tee, Rafferty stopped cleanly, made an announcement while Sherratt quipped, and with illumination quickly restored. took the score back to the trumpet-capped interlude before the beginning of the scene.When James, who's sold the bottle on to his friend having accumulated wealth but not happiness, finds a wife, cue music of love and intimacy which temporarily seems to lose the dynamic thread. Were it not for the warmth and conviction of Rachel Kelly (pictured below with McAteer), already a superlative mezzo fresh out of the Royal Opera's Jette Parker Young Artists Programme, as love-interest Catherine, the action would falter before the interval.It probably wouldn't have needed one if the action had been shorn by a quarter of an hour, though there's enough ingenuity to keep it all afloat in Matthew Richardson's production and Samal Blak's designs, joining with Ace McCarron's spot-on lighting to make a virtue of economy in a way that puts the expensive complications of the sets for The Master Builder, which I saw the previous night, to shame. Stars light up the creepy mansion; curtains and double bed become stained with a dark, evil-butterfly design and black finally seeps downwards in a threat to kill off the light. Repetitions, like the two plane journeys, point up the symmetry of the dramatic shape.The screw truly begins to turn, musically speaking, in the second act. The ingenuity of Stevenson's devilish scheme is that the bottle can bring everything the owner desires, but it has to be sold on at a lower price if said owner is to avoid damnation. The threat of hell is possibly a bit of a snag in a secular 21st century context; as Tove Jansson's grandmother tells her granddaughter in The Summer Book, ""You can see for yourself that life is hard enough without being punished for it afterwards"". But it's music's task to make the supernatural seem real.Admittedly with the pressure of Richard's drug-fuelled obsession and the desperate need to sell the bottle on for centimes comes an instrumental and vocal density that could also do with a bit of trimming. But the final twist, brilliantly devised by Walsh and MacRae, brings an ambiguous lightness. We could be witnessing the radiant beginnings of a new life, or the prequel to Rosemary's Baby. That's one of many ideas to mull over in this thought-provoking take on a myth with a difference, and even if it's not quite a masterwork, I sincerely hope The Devil Inside will be doing the rounds for years to come.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/devil-inside-peacock-theatre,4
253,"L'Étoile, Royal Opera",L'Étoile,Royal Opera,2016-02-02,David Nice,"Why have all attempts to make French comic opera funny to British audiences fallen so flat, at least since ENO's 1980s Orpheus in the Underworld? That company's La belle Hélène simply curled the toes, while Opera North managed to make a pig's-ear ""special edition"" of Chabrier's Le roi malgré lui. L'Étoile in its first staging at the Royal Opera fares better, not least because it's mostly performed in impeccable French, but does it ever reach the potentially hilarious pitch of Gilbert and Sullivan?The case for Chabrier's Star twinkling again is made by his first (1877) steps in a very personal brand of wry harmonic twists, rhythmic vivacity and piquant orchestration which gives the woodwind department almost as delicious a role as it has in Bizet's Carmen (premiered two years earlier). This is exactly the sort of music Tchaikovsky raved over as ""the pretty, le joli"". Tickling, sneezing and a bit of snogging are as dramatic as it gets. The numbers are slight, without a rollicking highlight like the ""Fête polonais"" in Le roi. The singers seem to have the measure of it, but why, then, does the orchestra drag ever so slightly behind? The blame must lie with Mark Elder, never much of a bouncer in any kind of music, and encouraging a laid-backness which really doesn't help the second or third verses of the many couplets.Visually, director Mariame Clément gets ingenious designer Julia Hansen to throw every sight gag in the book at each musical number, from beguilingly animated Moghul/Persian miniatures for the court of King Ouf – Ubu in the chrysalis – to naughty postcards and appropriate paintings including Ingres' harem bathers and even Millais' Ophelia (not a bad idea since, amazingly, Chabrier owned that Manet masterpiece A Bar at the Folies-Bergère).Ouf's unspecified kingdom is invaded by other royals disguised as department-store salesfolk whose relationships to each other, addled by disguise, really aren't so complicated that we need an interpolated Englishman (comedian Chris Addison, pictured above on the left with Kate Lindsay's Lazuli) to ask another extra character, his pal Dupont (Jean-Luc Vincent) to explain them. Though we're ultimately happy to see the pair incarcerated in a giant Chartreuse bottle, there are a few laughs to be wrung from their interjections, not least Mr Smith as Mr Holmes channelled via Benedict Cumberbatch, using his ""mind palace"" to find out what's happened to the missing hero. Who's played, in true French-opera style, by an attractive mezzo in trousers, Kate Lindsay. Her character, Lazuli, gets the lion's share of the solos, and the little song to the star is almost a melancholy hit; whatever the slightly underwhelming results, Lindsay – a superb Composer in Glyndebourne's Ariadne auf Naxos whom we haven't seen enough of since – delivers with panache and a nice line in chest voice, several passages (I'm guessing) taken ad lib down the octave.There's a pretty quartet in the second act, not much enriched by embraces in the dark, and a dull, repetitive one in the first when the royals arrive by balloon. The ladies – Hélène Guilmette as Princess Laoula, to be married to Ouf but quickly in love with Lazuli, and Julie Boulianne as companion Aloès – fare better than the men; both François Piolino as the splendidly named Hérisson de Porc-épic (""Hedgehog of Porcupine"") and Christophe Mortagne's Ouf suffer from short tops.Nothing can quite paper over the flailing absurdist drama as the action, or lack of it, totters onwards and the production begins to read as one big ad for Chartreuse (pictured above). At least that explains the cowled monk doing deus ex machina things throughout. Threats of execution, by an infernally designed armchair, and proposals of short-lived sex or marriage float in and out, with nothing like the backbone they give to G&S's The Mikado, composed eight years later. The finales go nowhere; the weak ending of Act Two has a half-hearted can-can with little evidence of choreographic work from Mathieu Guilhaumon. The numbers in Act Three tail off; it can't end too soon by then. Yes, Chabrier is a master of miniatures, but in trying to join the dots this hard-working production leaves us undernourished as a comic workout.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/letoile-royal-opera,3
254,"Alder, Hulett, Classical Opera, Page, Wigmore Hall",Alder,Hulett,2016-01-20,David Nice,"Unlike Schubert, Mendelssohn and Shostakovich, Mozart composed nothing astoundingly individual before the age of 20. That leaves any odyssey through his oeuvre, year by year – this one will finish in 2041, by which time I’ll be nearly 80 if I live that long – with a problem effectively solved by Ian Page and his Classical Opera in placing works by contemporaries of various ages alongside young Amadeus’s efforts. For the music of the nevertheless precocious nine/ten-year-old of the year 1766, directness of communication was everything, not a problem given Page’s players and two bright young singers who’ve taken off immediately after leaving music college, soprano Louise Alder and tenor Benjamin Hulett.This period-instrument band is superlative, a healthy mix of young musicians with well-established names like horn-player Roger Montgomery and harpsichordist Christopher Bucknall. The opening symphony, sinfonietta more like, Mozartino’s B flat major effort now numbered Five, flashed past so swiftly that you only just had time to absorb the rapier-like strings projecting so cleanly in the Wigmore, especially incisive when doubled by the two oboes (Mozart at the keyboard among musicians in Paris, 1766, pictured below). Principal oboist James Eastaway brought astonishing artistry to bear on the slow movement of Bohemian Johann Baptist Vanhal’s Symphony in G minor; its naivety could border on the inane, but sweet high tone and discreet ornamentation of the main theme’s return kept it charming. And there was more work for Eastaway in the lovely trio of the Menuetto.Real individuality was to be found here, starting with the chromatic minor-key opening answered by a blaze of major light; Page, so good at getting pianissimos from his players, made sure the exposition repeat was even quieter. The orchestra blazed in a proto-Beethoven explosion, the first movement of Franz Ignaz Beck’s Symphony in D, looking forward to the iconoclastic master in its fierce tremolos and sudden accents; the manner is perhaps more interesting than the matter. A final symphony only recently attibuted definitively to Wolfgang rather than father Leopold, the ""Old Lambach"", showed some promise in the first movement – its stalking bass lines probably share no more than a convention of the time with the ""Lo conosco?"" sequence from Figaro – and perfect competence in the second and third. Page engagingly told us that this would not be a performance anything like as ""authentic"" as the first, since Leopold denounced each section, and some of the players, as absolutely awful.The interloping symphonists were needed to ballast the often charming gaucheness of the boy Mozart. Two concert arias were small pickings for a singer as consummate as Alder, who had to contend with thick middle textures in “Per pietà”, sadly the plea not of Da Ponte’s Fiordiligi’s but of Metastasio’s Artaxerxes, and only really got to show her subtlety in two cadenzas (the second especially impressive with a diminuendo on the high note). She palpitated more maturely against the pizzicato heartbeats of an aria from Guglielmi’s Lo spirito del contradizione and charmed us in an artless ditty by JC Bach for the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens. Despite clear diction, though, Alder was not best served by the amplifying, voice-muddying Wigmore acoustic (both the Royal Albert Hall and the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, however, have already served her to perfection).Hulett (pictured right by Hans Lebbe), sounding far more virile in this tricky space than your average ex-choral-scholar tenor, was favoured with the gravity of the “Et incarnatus est” from Haydn’s Missa Cellensis – the repeated words don’t really fit the music, but never mind – and the most interestingly orchestrated of the arias, from Jommelli’s Il Vologeso, where the strings have an elaborate weave in the recitative and hold the foreground in the aria proper. Jommelli’s notching-up of operas (80) seems to have been subordinate to Guglielmi’s (95), but he had the greater reputation in his time, and it will be fascinating to hear the complete Il Vologeso from Classical Opera in April.The tenor’s last aria was a compulsory piece of grovelling by the young Mozart, newly returned from an exhausting European tour, at the feet of Salzburg’s Prince-Archbishop (“so great and so many are Sigismund’s merits that our feeble skills are unable to fathom that venerable heart”). It was the only piece on the generous programme which slightly outstayed its welcome, regardless of varying qualities – quite a feat of good planning and energetic execution on Page’s part.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/alder-hulett-classical-opera-page-wigmore-hall,4
255,"Tosca, Royal Opera",Tosca,Royal Opera,2016-01-12,alexandra Coghlan,"To say this latest revival of the Royal Opera’s Tosca peaks early would be an understatement. The shockwaves rippling out from the brass and timpani in the first few bars set the auditorium rumbling, tumbling the strings into motion. Conductor Emmanuel Villaume seizes his audience and refuses to let go, dragging us in to join the dance of the Sacristan’s sleekly self-satisfied music with its sacrilegious whiff of the Palm Court. To say the evening doesn’t get better than this is both to applaud such galvanising energy and orchestral character, and to say that it’s all downhill from here.The issues seem to stem from the cast – the second of the two booked for this seventh revival of Jonathan Kent’s classic production. Neither Amanda Echalaz’s Tosca nor Najmiddin Mavlyanov’s Cavaradossi seem at ease, dragging against Villaume’s tempos throughout (last night the entire Act I love scene sat almost half a beat behind the orchestra) and both lacking sufficient gas in the tank for the Act III climax.In the case of Mavlyanov, making his Royal Opera debut, it’s perhaps understandable, but far less so for Echalaz – a familiar figure both in this role and this production. Of the two it’s her vocal issues that dominate, forcing her to cut off top notes abruptly, seemingly unable to sustain them, and gripping uncomfortably at the top of her register. Though by no means a heavy voice, Echalaz has all the vocal ticks of one manipulating a large instrument, consistently lagging behind and swooping more for convenience than expressive intent. Her Tosca manifests as matronly, lacking those flashes of vocal agility that must colour this diva’s magnificence if she isn’t to turn from temptress to headmistress.Whether through poor direction or simply a lack of rehearsal, Act II suffers from some of the least convincing staging we’ve seen at the ROH. Echalez (pictured above right) brandishes a candlestick at Roberto Frontali’s Scarpia with all the menace of an umbrella, while he in turn aggresses her with implausible chastity, hands placed decorously and with care. Fortunately Paul Brown’s sets are still handsome and atmospheric, anchoring this rather flimsy drama.Although occasionally giving flashes of something worth coming back for (“Vittoria! Vittoria!” was a punch of pure vocal muscle), Mavlyanov never quite shook the dust sheets off the voice, projecting dully and lacking ring. What seemed initially like a daring long-game approach to “E Lucevan” turned ultimately into an underpowered performance. More successful was Frontali’s Scarpia, bitter and edgy rather than richly dark, more a character-villain than one of beauty.Unexpectedly poor intonation blotted the Act III cello quartet, but otherwise the orchestral playing is as richly upholstered as the sets. The visual spectacle of Kent’s production retains its wonder 10 years on, coming into its own for the Act I Mass thanks to Brown’s elegant designs. It’s still very much a show worth revisiting, though perhaps only, on this occasion, in the hands of Angela Gheorghiu and Cast 1.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/tosca-royal-opera-0,3
256,"Pelléas et Mélisande, LSO, Rattle, Barbican",Pelléas et Mélisande,LSO,2016-01-10,alexandra Coghlan,"Debussy’s Pelléas et Mélisande is a drama played out in shadow. Shine too bright, too unyielding a directorial light on it, and the delicate dramatic fabric – all unspokens and unspeakables – frays into air. Just over a year ago, director David Edwards and the Philharmonia Orchestra gave us a semi-staging of exquisitely allusive simplicity, leaving the music to fill the gaps between symbol and emotion. Now it’s the turn of Peter Sellars and  Simon Rattle – reuniting to stage the work that first brought them together in 1993.And what a difference a decade (or two) makes. Where Rattle and Sellars’s Amsterdam Pelléas played out in a Malibu mansion, sexual rather than sensual – a realist put-down to the opera’s whimsical fairytale history – their new collaboration shares more with Sellars’s “ritualisations” of Bach’s Passions than his work for the opera house.At the centre of it all, both musically and spatially, are the LSO. Fanning out across the entire width of the Barbican’s stage, they cradle the drama taking place amongst them. With violas and second violins taking the outer positions, closest to the audience, their hold is a deliberately soft one, cushioning the sharper, brighter, more pointed contributions of harp, oboe and first violins, and creating the finest of musical membranes around the sound.Rattle’s relationship with this score is a long one, and it unfolds here in spontaneous, giddy arcs of acceleration that shudder into eddying pauses. It’s storytelling of the most instinctive kind, its text picked out in gilded detail by the musicians of the LSO. There’s a delicacy here, even to moments of extreme violence, that seems the musical echo of Sellars’s staging – a series of suggestions, implications, possibilities that rarely coalesces into anything approaching a statement.Maeterlinck’s symbols – a tower, a cave, a lost ring – all retain their ambiguity, and only with his flock of sheep does Sellars slip into easy political assertion, as their “identity cards” are checked by a mobile-phone-clutching border-guard of a shepherd. Props are minimal. A black box placed centre-stage serves as tower, forest pool, bed and deathbed, allowing Mélisande to die among the violins, as the composer intended. At the back of the stage, a single chair allows Arkel to watch over the action, both threat and protector.What’s most striking is the reaction of a director whose language is physical symbol, ordered, ritualised gesture, to a drama whose own symbols are already so clearly defined. Aided by an exceptional cast, Sellars’s style softens into a stylised naturalism, finding the human as well as the humane in the story. Even with the clutter of a symphony orchestra on stage, you’re always aware of Gerald Finley’s Golaud (pictured above with Elias Madler and Franz-Josef Selig). His hunting doesn’t stop at the end of the opening scene, but continues throughout as he stalks and prowls, dangerously obsessed with Magdalena Kožená’s Mélisande. This confusion of tenderness and violence is mirrored vocally. Such patrician smoothness and control, such tonal beauty becomes grotesque when allied to the bullying of his son (the astonishingly mature Elias Madler) or his physical abuse of his wife.Nobody takes a vocal line for a walk quite like Christian Gerhaher, whose Pelléas is one unfolding legato gesture, a halo of bright harmonics brightening his baritone for this high-lying role. Together with Finley, however, and both the magnificent Franz-Josef Selig as Arkel and Kožená’s mezzo heroine, he pushes the musical centre of gravity down into a darker place. No vocal light makes it into this Allemonde.There’s no denying that Mélisande is a role that suits Kožená (pictured left), making sense of the singer’s nervy series of performing ticks and sitting in a comfortable place vocally for this soprano-ish mezzo, but whether Kožená is the right performer for the role is less certain. Her Mélisande is no innocent. Instead of Maeterlinck’s vulnerable child we get a womanly seductress, fully in command of her two lovers. Compared to the interiority of Finley’s performance Kožená’s is positively cartoonish. Only the suggestion of real mental instability, that her Mélisande is aping a sexuality she has seen and learned, playing a role as best she can, saves the situation.Sellars has described Pelléas as “the ultimate non-operatic opera – opera as real life”. But watching his characters move through a stylised lightsaber forest, loving and hating among the musicians of the LSO, what he has created is real-life as opera. There’s no banality here, no anchor in the everyday, just pure emotion and psychology elevated and intensified by so casual a staging. Its home may be the concert-hall, but Debussy’s work has rarely been more richly or satisfyingly operatic.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/pell%C3%A9as-et-m%C3%A9lisande-lso-rattle-barbican,5
257,Best of 2015: Opera,Best of 2015: Opera,,2015-12-30,David Nice,"How ironic that English National Opera turned out possibly the two best productions of the year after the Arts Council had done its grant-cutting worst, punishing the company simply, it seemed, for not being the irrationally preferred Royal Opera. And while 2015 has been as good as it gets artistically speaking for ENO, 2016 may well see confirmation of the first steps towards its dismantling by a short-sighted management – for what is a great opera house without a big chorus or a full roster of productions, both elements under threat?Meanwhile, let’s celebrate the positive. Both the outgoing and the incoming ENO music directors astonished us all in tandem with fine casts, the aforementioned chorus on peak form and two of the most original directors. Richard Jones’s production of Wagner’s The Mastersingers of Nuremberg wasn’t new, as some awards ceremonies wanted us to believe; it had already been acclaimed at Welsh National Opera back in 2010, sung in German. Miraculously, it was just as good this time round, with Iain Paterson as the central character of philosopher-cobbler Hans Sachs neither better nor worse than Bryn Terfel for WNO, just different. Edward Gardner went straight to the lovely soul of the piece within minutes of the Prelude, and stayed there throughout, without ever having conducted this longest of opera scores before. Colleagues on theartsdesk Alexandra Coghlan and Jessica Duchen join me in granting this Mastersingers the laurel crown.No less an achievement on its own, comfortless terms was ENO’s first production of the 2015-16 season, Shostakovich's Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, a canny choice for the new musical nerve-centre, Mark Wigglesworth, since he’d conducted it with astonishing depth and impact for the company back in 2001. While David Pountney’s staging then was chaotic and visceral, Dmitri Tcherniakov went for a cooler, more calculated framework that nevertheless provided the right context for the heartbreaking Katerina Izmailova of American soprano Patricia Racette. I’ll never forget the surprising impact of the squalid cell surrounded by a vast blackness at the beginning of the final act (pictured above by Clive Barda) – the sort of unpredictable visionary quality that Tcherniakov at his best shares with Jones.Those who expected Mike Leigh to break the mould in directing Gilbert and Sullivan’s The Pirates of Penzance for ENO were disappointed. But this classy, classical act boasted a brilliant cast directed with discipline and well-placed gags which got the required belly laughs. Even more were in supply throughout Sasha Regan’s all-male Pirates, and in pocket Charles Court Opera’s hysterically funny Ruddigore and revived Trial by Jury (Catrine Kirkman's Essex Plaintiff, unsung comedy performer of the year alongside John Savournin's Judge Judy, pictured below) – among the most tear-inducingly witty half-hours I’ve ever enjoyed on the London stage, musical or otherwise.Total works of art like these in the operatic year were more than usual; the art-form demands so much in every quarter that in an average season you’d be lucky to get as many as three. But in terms of dramatic rethinking, excellent cast and orchestral excellence, at least five more deserve to join the list: David McVicar jettisoning the placidity that’s afflicted some of his recent productions in a period-costume yet nevertheless radical Mozart Die Entführung aus dem Serail (The Abduction from the Seraglio) at Glyndebourne with a dislocating third act, thanks especially to the greater than usual significance of the speaking role, Pasha Selim (Franck Saurel). Alexandra was bowled over by director Barrie Kosky’s redemption in Handel’s Saul, also at the Sussex house, while Garsington, top amongst other fine country opera contenders this year, presented an adventurous season with a sparely beautiful Britten Death in Venice at its heart, tenor Paul Nilon reminding us that he’s the natural successor to the music-theatrical hold of the late Philip Langridge (Allan Clayton looks set to take over the mantle soon). Clive Barda takes opera photographer of the year award with his shot of Celestin Boutin's Tadzio and Nilon's Aschenbach, pictured below.Richard Bratby loved the Buxton concert performance of Charpentier’s Louise, a gem which still needs a full production, ideally at Glyndebourne, and was taken with the cinematic fantasy of English Touring Opera's Tales of Hoffmann. Stephen Walsh found Pountney’s staging of Debussy’s Pelléas et Mélisande at Welsh National Opera another total experience, while we regret that David Kettle hadn’t joined the team when he saw the second Scots production of James MacMillan’s visceral Ines de Castro at the beginning of the year. Graham Rickson has no hesitation in choosing Kiss Me, Kate as the highlight of Opera North’s varied repertoire in 2015.The opera I’d been most eagerly anticipating on stage, Nielsen’s Saul and David, was absent from the UK stage in the 150th anniversary year of the composer’s birth; Pountney’s production for the Royal Danish Opera in Copenhagen on the very birthday, 9 June, didn’t convince me that it’s more than a static oratorio, but what inspired material, effortlessly convincing under the baton of Michael Schønwandt with Johan Reuter searing as the mentally unwell king. Generous-spirited Dane Kasper Holten, announcing his departure from the Royal Opera rather sooner than we'd like, but for admirable family reasons, made a good choice of world premiere on the main stage in Georg Friedrich Haas’s Morgen und Abend, a first airing which made enough of an impact to suggest that this unusual vision of birth followed by death will live in the repertoire (though both dramaturgy and music divided opinion).Star performances, often in less than perfect evenings, were abundant. Five sopranos made a huge impact, two in their London debuts. At ENO we discovered that rare breed, a lyric-dramatic singer who can scour the soul with her dramatic urgency: American Tamara Wilson dazzled as Leonora in Calixto Bieito’s very uneven production of Verdi’s dramatically awkward The Force of Destiny. Australian Nicole Car found all the right dramatic truth as Tchaikovsky’s Tatyana in Holten’s initially disliked Royal Opera Eugene Onegin (overall, I still liked it more the first time). Albanian soprano Ermonela Jaho chewed the carpet in a good way as Leoncavallo’s Zazà (pictured above by Russell Duncan) in a bewitching semi-staged performance at the Barbican, idiomatic Maurizio Benini conducting a seemingly very happy BBC Symphony Orchestra. Fflur Wyn showed charm and coloratura ease as Delibes' Lakmé, well partnered by tenor Robert Murray at Holland Park – ravishing score perfectly executed, inept production. Another French treasure, Massenet's Le roi de Lahore, finally appeared in concert with Royal Opera Jette Parker Young Artist Anush Hovhannisyan getting into her stride courtesy of Chelsea Opera Group, who finally made amends for a major omission from Wagner anniversary year with Wagner's early clunker Das Liebesverbot.Other stars of the year are even younger, and I can’t remember a better time for talent pouring out of the music colleges. In student productions, mezzo Kezia Bienek, Callas-like in temperament, and tenor Gyula Rab excelled in one of the two casts for the Royal College of Music’s totally accomplished staging of Handel’s delightful pasticcio Giove in Argo, while a chance to see Wolf-Ferrari’s patchily inspired comedy Le donne curiose (aka The Nosy Wives of Venice) very humorously staged at the Guildhall School was enriched by a natural Welsh lyric tenor, Elgan Thomas (pictured below with Nicola Said by Clive Barda).Already one of our finest lyric sopranos, Louise Alder has been mostly hidden from UK sight taking on principal roles at Frankfurt Opera in her first year out of music college, but we got to see her in a revelatory 17th century Orpheus, Luigi Rossi’s, at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse. And while bass-baritone Ashley Riches wasn’t allowed to characterise much as Schaunard in the major disappointment of ENO’s drug-fuelled Bohème, he slips in by virtue of an exceptionally vivid oratorio performance in the last major event of the year, the Academy of Ancient Music’s complete Bach Christmas Oratorio. So I can end by reproducing the same phrase I used at the beginning of the classical concerts “Best of 2015”, as far as younger artists are concerned, at least: the musical future looks bright indeed.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/best-2015-opera,
258,"Eugene Onegin, Royal Opera",Eugene Onegin,Royal Opera,2015-12-20,David Nice,"Searing emotional truth has to be at the core of any attempt to stage Tchaikovsky’s “lyrical scenes after Pushkin”. I was among the minority who thought Kasper Holten got it right, with deep knowledge of the original verse-novel, in his first production as Covent Garden’s Director of Opera back in February 2013. Then he had total commitment from Simon Keenlyside and Krasimira Stoyanova as an Onegin and Tatyana looking back in anguish on their youthful selves, and Pavol Breslik to the manner born as doomed, callow poet Lensky. This time only one of the three principals is about much more than the voice – and all are top-notch – but she makes it worth revisiting this tightened-up show.Australian soprano Nicole Car sang Tatyana when this production arrived in Sydney, and reports were ecstatic. As, indeed, is she in the early stages as the young girl whose infatuation with an enigmatic young dandy drives her to screeds of letter-writing passion before despair kicks in. Tchaikovsky’s Act One belongs to Tatyana, and thanks to the meaning and intensity with which Car (pictured below) manages to fill every phrase, the “meeting” of older if no wiser Tatyana with her teenage self (Emily Ranford) I find no less moving than before – vindicated, certainly, by the still centre of the Letter Scene as the woman who knows her fate holds the girl so full of bewilderment in a still embrace. Lucky those who could catch the facial expressions at closer quarters than the second row of the Balcony.Car, unusually, has the vocal heft and range as well as the looks to embrace Tatyana as impulsive girl and – in this production – desperate married woman. In the driven final scene, her darkish vocal timbre and dramatic skills remind me of Elisabeth Söderström in her prime. She rages convincingly against the Onegin who couldn’t make up his mind, who arrives too late at the realisation that he loves the girl he confusedly rejected. But it has to be an equal match, and dramatically it isn’t. Dmitri Hvorostovky came to personable life in Robert Carsen’s Met production but here he’s back to stiff persona and on-transmit vocals. The temperatures drop with each of his rejoinders towards the end. It’s still a fine, smoothish baritone sound, but no longer the Guarnerius cello phrasing the arioso of Onegin’s rejection so beautifully on the recording conducted by Semyon Bychkov over 23 years ago.Bychkov, as ever, is more about dark, earthy, doomy phrasing than the lightness and air which need to penetrate the melancholy of the drama’s early stages (and did, on this production’s first airing, under Robin Ticciati). He’s willing to support, which is ever so slightly to over-indulge, tenor Michael Fabiano (pictured below with Hvorostovsky), who initially fails to convince us of Lensky’s ardour and doesn’t pull out all the raging stops when the poet finds his friend flirting with his girl Olga (Oksana Volkova, perfect) at Tatyana’s name-day party: this confrontation can blaze, and – top note apart – it didn't last night.In purely vocal terms, though, the aria before the fatal duel is technical perfection and would win all accolades in concert performance. The sorrowing clarinet responses have all the air they need, and Bychkov makes the descending bass lines towards the end sound like the end of Tchaikovsky’s ""Pathétique"" Symphony – many years in the future at the time of Onegin’s composition – and projects the baleful trombones as tragedy looms very impressively.Ferruccio Furlanetto has licence to dramatise the presence of Tatyana’s general husband Prince Gremin, but the keenly-anticipated aria is disappointing: rough and flat. Not even basses keep their vocal sheen for ever, it seems. There are reliable cameos from Diana Montague’s elegant mother, Catherine Wyn-Rogers’ surprisingly authentic Nyanya, James Platt's unusually authoritative Zaretsky – could he be a future Gremin? – and Jean-Paul Fouchécourt, not allowed to make too much of Monsieur Triquet’s name-day homage. The chorus sounds appropriately full-bodied, though in this production, they don't move much, threatening black-and-white figures of convention against Onegin's deep blue and Tatyana's red (pictured below, strong input from Mia Stensgaard's set, Katrina Lindsay's costumes and Wolfgang Göbbel's lighting in the first scene).Holten has tweaked the production: I think I’m right in saying that the more mannered dance element of the younger Onegin and Tatyana is minimised, and our heroine no longer stands in a cupboard to hide from the party catastrophe. For all its passing flaws, though, first time round was best – and you can catch it on a DVD which provides further focus. Watch it and if you like what you see go this time for Car, Lensky’s last aria and some of the orchestral detail. It might also be worth waiting for impressive young Polish baritone Artur Rucinski, who takes over the role of Onegin for the last two performances.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/eugene-onegin-royal-opera-0,3
259,"A Christmas Carol, Welsh National Opera",A Christmas Carol,Welsh National Opera,2015-12-19,stephen Walsh,"Dickens’s public readings from his novels were almost as famous and popular as the novels themselves. He would write special scripts that gave prominence to particular characters and that dramatized the salient events of each story; and of all these performances, A Christmas Carol was one of the favourites, his and his audiences’. So what better idea than to turn this unforgettable tale into an opera: an opera for a single singer, dramatizing the story, impersonating all the main characters, being, as it were, Dickens himself with added music?Iain Bell’s opera, new last year but performed here for the first time in the Weston Studio of Cardiff’s Millennium Centre on Friday, is the answer to that question. The idea, it turns out, is only half good. For a speaker, whether the author or, recently and brilliantly, Simon Callow treading page-like in his steps, it works because for an actor being alone with a script on an empty stage is both liberating and a kind of implied triumph over all the other actors who aren’t there to get in your way.For a singer the situation is very different. He (in this case) is the prisoner of the score and the orchestra; he cannot deviate, hesitate or repeat. He simply has to get it right, no easy matter in a 90-minute monologue against a complex and not altogether considerate orchestral score.So great praise for tenor Mark Le Brocq for surviving this challenge, generally making sense of it, and turning it into a genuine entertainment, holding the stage in the guise of the author with bald pate and bushy side hair, an array of hats, cloaks, shoes, a finger puppet for never-so-Tiny Tim, and an Olympiad of dashes and leaps, Roger-de-Coverley dance steps, and squeaky children’s voices, that would surely have delighted Dickens’s audience as much as it delighted WNO’s.Le Brocq (pictured right with Tiny Tim) is a stage natural. So long as he was playing to the audience, hauling up pretty girls from the front stalls or kissing them under the mistletoe, gesticulating to the conductor, or drumming up applause for simply changing his coat, he was in his element. But skilful and powerful singer though he is, he couldn’t wholly disguise the vocal problems in Bell’s writing. The opera calls for huge stamina. Yet Bell often writes for his 15-piece chamber orchestra as if the singer weren’t there.Absurdly, his most delicate effects – such as the exquisite opening to the second act – are reserved for moments when the voice is silent. The voice strikes up and the orchestra competes. Listening to the orchestra, there is much to enjoy of an anecdotal kind; but listening to the singer can be as wearing as it must be for him singing this music. Could one follow the ins and outs of the story without having read it? I have my doubts.Polly Graham’s direction here was lively and atmospheric, nicely if sometimes erratically lit by Ceri James, and straightforwardly designed by Nate Gibson. Graham might have thought of thematizing Le Brocq’s frequent use of a score, presumably as an aide memoire. After all, Dickens must surely have read from a text, however freely. James Southall conducted attentively and painstakingly, and the players did their best to tone down Bell’s more obvious excesses. But in the end a score is a chastity belt for which only the composer holds the key. And at the crucial moment he, in Derrida’s sense, is absent.Bell has another new opera coming up for WNO in June: a setting of David Jones’s prose poem In Parenthesis. Whether this will have a narrative format like A Christmas Carol I’ve no idea, but I hope the singers will be given more musical space.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/christmas-carol-welsh-national-opera,3
260,"Cavalleria Rusticana/Pagliacci, Royal Opera",Cavalleria Rusticana/Pagliacci,Royal Opera,2015-12-04,alexandra Coghlan,"You can forgive a certain amount of scepticism. After his now-infamous Royal Opera debut earlier this year, directing a Guillaume Tell that was heavy on concept and light on just about everything else, Damiano Michieletto returns for a Cavalleria Rusticana/Pagliacci that sounded as though it might go the same way. In the flesh, however – and what work-calloused, life-blasted verismo flesh it is too – the production is thoughtful and instinctively theatrical – as good a new show from the company as we’ve seen all year.Imagine the primary-coloured joy and pastel innocence of the Royal Opera’s 1950s L’Elisir some thirty years on and you have Michieletto’s Cav/Pag. The small-town Italian optimism has curdled into disillusionment and poverty is now no longer the hopeful beginning but the cynical end to the story.The sense of entrapment is heightened by Michieletto’s elegant interweaving of his dual narratives. Neither we nor his characters can escape tragedy at the interval; just as Nedda and Silvio meet, flirt and kiss during the action of Cavalleria Rusticana, so the still-heartbroken Mamma Lucia and pregnant Santuzza must comfort one another against a backdrop of theatrical excitement in Pagliacci. Verismo’s dramatic gradient is a steep one, often struggling to reach its peak before crashing right down again in a single act. Michieletto’s integrated storytelling reimagines this, trading two steep melodramas for a single one, all the more potent for its more gradual, cumulative build.The concept relies on singers capable of acting through the visual noise of crowds (magically amplified by Alessandro Carletti’s lighting), children, a spectacular (and spectacularly vulgar) procession in honour of the virgin, and the general chaos of small-town life, all played-out on designer Paolo Fantin’s neat revolve. In Elena Zilio’s Mamma Lucia (pictured right), Michieletto has a gift – the emotional anchor of the piece, she never moves but she says volumes. Which makes it all the more frustrating in the odd moments where Michieletto gets heavy-handed, demanding protracted and unnecessary weeping and howling from a woman who – as someone near me observed – would be much more likely to face tragedy by baking a loaf of bread than by wandering the streets screaming.Eva-Maria Westbroek’s Santuzza – likewise – keeps her emotions close to the surface. Unlike Zilio, however, whose lived-in voice transforms these raw feelings into something beautiful, Westbroek’s is a rougher take on the tale. Her voice struggles to fit itself into Mascagni’s melodic confines, beating against the orchestra with her wide vibrato. It’s effectively, devastatingly unlovely; this is grief without the Italian gloss, which may suit Michieletto’s cause but makes less sense of Mascagni’s.Though his Turiddu is passionate and strongly projected, it’s as Canio that Alexandrs Antonenko comes into his own. Brilliant in its middle register, there’s now a tightness to the top of his voice that comes close to derailing him both at the start and in his Brindisi. But things get more grounded later, climaxing in a “Vesti la guibba” that’s both controlled and menacing in its beauty. It’s the equal and opposite balance to Dimitri Platanias’s Prologo – laconic humour turning to sudden vocal violence.At the centre of Leoncavallo’s love-triangle is Carmen Giannattasio’s Nedda, a woman whose bitter, brittle relationship with her husband is shocked from her mind by the tentative sweetness of Dionysios Sourbis’ Silvio. Thanks to the addition of some crucial backstory in Cav, this romance carries more heft than usual, giving both Platanias and Antonenko something real to chafe against, and adding fuel to the desperate hopes of “Stridono lassu”. Another twist sees the opera’s play-within-an-opera break its frame, spilling back out into real life – projections of Canio’s jealous fantasy? It’s unclear, but set against the loving realism of the chorus action and the uncomplicated generosity of the musical delivery under Antonio Pappano, it generates thrilling friction – a moment of climatic excess that takes this Pagliacci over the dramatic edge.It’s a rare year in which neither Cav nor Pag are their composers’s first appearances in the opera calendar. This production comes hot on the heels of revelatory performances of both Guglielmo Ratcliff (Wexford) and Zazà (Barbican), and with a Chenier also on offer from the Royal Opera this year could verismo at last be having a moment that goes beyond Puccini? Let’s hope so. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/cavalleria-rusticanapagliacci-royal-opera,4
261,"Zazà, BBCSO, Benini, Barbican",Zazà,BBCSO,2015-11-29,David Nice,"Send in the clowns, as they sing in this palace-of-varieties first act, not for Pagliacci, Leoncavallo’s sole foothold on today’s operatic repertoire, but for the fool-for-love heroine of a sparkling, swooning rarity. Musically, Zazà is a notch above Mascagni and Giordano for orchestral delights, just below supreme genius Puccini, but its admittedly thinly-spread plot ends by being rather remarkable. Our heroine-artiste may be temporarily broken by her infatuation with a bourgeois theatregoer who turns out to be married, but she’ll return to the stage, and she even manages to expose him for the shallow bastard he is before the curtain falls on her desolation.Having powered through with a sense of flaming indignation and a lyric voice that soars in true Italianate style, the like of which we haven’t heard since Angela Gheorghiu and Anja Harteros first hit the heights, Albanian soprano Ermonela Jaho seemed drained and surprised by what she’d achieved. Had her Royal Opera Suor Angelica four years ago still been in fledging mode, or hadn’t I appreciated the replacement for the keenly anticipated Harteros? Well, we'll see when she returns in the revival next year, but certainly her Zazà in concert was the real deal. There are vocal flaws, certainly: in order perhaps not to cut off any kind of artificial chest voice from the rest of the instrument, Jaho underprojected the lower notes, and the top could go sharp; still, better that in excitement than flat and underenergised. In any case all this could easily be forgiven for the supple movements, the looks, the warm flights into the stratosphere, the hundred and ten per cent of the final scene.Other pleasures kept level pegging until Jaho's ultimate pulling out of all the stops. Experienced conductor Maurizio Benini had the right controlled sensuousness for Leoncavallo’s poise between Neapolitan passion and neoclassical elegance. Under him the BBC Symphony Orchestra sounded nimble in the first act’s variety turns – if a little loud, as if he hadn’t properly gauged the Barbican’s amplifying properties – and fabulously delicate in the third, where Leoncavallo assumes the delicately sentimental manner of Massenet for the little girl of the bourgeois household whose peace of mind Zazà decides not to disturb.The score is full of delights sweepingly big and tellingly small (like leader Stephen Bryant’s downward chromatic run to depict an unzipping in a dressing-room). It can follow the Puccini manner, if not quite the great Puccini tune, in the warm lover’s music of the cad, Dufresne, sung with totally idiomatic Italian-tenor ardour by Riccardo Massi (pictured above with Jaho and BBCSO players). The two most memorable set-pieces, surely, belong to the sympathetic baritone, Zazà’s fellow singer, career-launcher and one-time lover Cascart; stepping in at shortish notice, Met regular Stephen Gaertner did them opulently proud.At even shorter notice - 24 hours, apparently - mezzo from the BBC Singers Rebecca Lodge gamely made sure the show went on with her virtual sight-reading in the role of Anaide, the inebriate mother for whom Zazà shows intuitive understanding in amongst the bitterness. Among the many cameo roles, Kathryn Rudge, David Stout and Nicky Spence held their heads high alongside the stars. ""Director"" Susannah Waters couldn't be expected to do much when scores and stands were in use throughout, but there was neat contrast between the vaudeville stage and the same platform used to display a piano on which Dufresne's sweet daughter Totò ""plays"" the Cherubini Ave Maria in Act Three.With only one half-cock Italian recording of Zazà in the CD catalogue, Opera Rara’s choice in setting down Leoncavallo's 1919 revision of the already finely-drawn 1900 original for 2016 release is an astute one. There’s only one snag; the performance had already been captured in the studio before this concert. And given how Jaho burned before a spellbound audience in the final scene, the company may now be regretting that there weren’t mikes in the Barbican too to splice in the most explosive moments (hard to match acoustics, no doubt, if I'm right in assuming Maida Vale as the first venue).There’s nothing like Italian opera when the performance is all-engulfing. It doesn’t happen often, but it happened here on Friday night, giving Jaho artist of the year status alongside Tamara Wilson’s astounding London debut as Verdi's Leonora in the ENO Force of Destiny. Yes, it’s been a good 11 months for opera in London, and there's still December to go.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/zaza-bbcso-benini-barbican,5
262,"Castor et Pollux, St John's Smith Square",Castor et Pollux,St John's Smith Square,2015-11-21,alexandra Coghlan,"An evening of Rameau was never going to be a neutral event. Last Friday all things French became painfully, irretrievably politicised, and while there were no speeches or acknowledgements last night, when Christian Curnyn dispatched the opera’s final ensemble not in fanfares and crescendos but the slyest of diminuendos, it was the perfect response –a Gallic shrug of a gesture, defiant in its charm and wit.Castor and Pollux shouldn’t work in concert – especially not, as in St John’s Smith Square, without surtitles. Rameau’s music describes and emotes, but never really dramatises, relying on staging and dance to bring it from beautiful stasis to movement. But such is Curnyn’s giddy, propulsive energy that he and his Early Opera Company needed nothing to supplement the music in this concert performance.It helped that the opera’s central quartet was made up of four exceptional young singers – artists we’re still getting to know, but who are each here for the long haul. Most recently seen across town in ENO’s La bohème, Ashley Riches was a poised, darkly serious Pollux. Though occasionally colouring outside the lines with his vibrato, his baritone offered a tonal anchor in a cast dominated by upper voices, while his emotional intensity held the drama through Rameau’s many orchestral ritornellos.Joining Riches in an unusually happy love triangle were Samuel Boden and Katherine Watson, with Sophie Junker as jealous love rival Phoebe, condemning herself to Hell before anyone else can do it for her. The standout here was Watson (pictured above right). Hers is a quality voice, all ease and fullness, with a welcome darkness shading even its upper register. Her “Tristes apprets” swelled and bloomed with tragedy, before a quick sleight of hand saw her become a brittle, flirtatious follower of Hebe for the exquisite “Que nos jeux comblent”. Junker, too, did double duty, brightly projected (if underused) as Phoebe, but vocally at her sweetest and most beguiling as a spirit for “Dans ces doux aziles”.Though lacking much by way of blade, Samuel Boden’s tenor (Boden pictured left) is so velvet-tactile as to distract from its small proportions. His warmly expressive Castor was an effective foil for Watson’s Telaire, though there was strain in the voice as he struggled occasionally to assert himself over the orchestra. Cameos from the excellent Callum Thorpe (Jupiter) and Zachary Wilder (fearless for the absurdly high “Eclatez fieres trompettes”) did the business, but the award for Best Supporting Role went to the orchestra. Flutes duetted with mossy softness, a tambourine did virtuosic battle all on its own, while always in the centre Curnyn and his strings kept the engine ticking in dancing rhythms.French Baroque has a tough time in the UK. Audiences aren’t guaranteed in the way they are for Bach or Handel, and it takes a brave venue to host (or an even braver company to stage) any of the many operas by Rameau, Lully and Charpentier that are so very worth performing. Perhaps a solid Friday-night crowd will persuade St Johns Smith Square to continue to mine this rich musical seam? If and when they do, I’ll be first in the queue.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/castor-et-pollux-st-johns-smith-square,4
263,"Morgen und Abend, Royal Opera",Morgen und Abend,Royal Opera,2015-11-14,David Nice,"It’s never funny like Ligeti’s Le grand macabre, though it touches on that joke apocalypse’s more nebulous soundscapes. Nor is it obviously dynamic like David Sawer’s From Morning to Midnight, with which its title is not to be confused (there are no transitional stages here, only birth and death). Wagner’s cosmic sweeps don't entangle the banal with the numinous like this. So what exactly is the new opera Morning and Evening?Of only one thing I’m sure: Austrian composer Georg Friedrich Haas and Norwegian writer Jon Fosse have created a world, before and after life as we know it, like no other. In this they’re near-perfectly assisted by the cast, and perfectly so by conductor Michael Boder and director Graham Vick, in a world premiere of which the Royal Opera and its Director of Opera Kasper Holten can be proud.There’s none of the tawdry compromise that took the edge off busier firsts at Covent Garden like Ades’s The Tempest and Maw's Sophie's Choice; the hallucinatory experience is closer to Birtwistle's operas. Purity of intent – no spoiler here – is represented by the single line opposite the cast list in the programme, “Morgen und Abend…is the struggle of Johannes into and out of life”, and by the few chairs, bed, fishing boat, door, umbrella and trolley on Richard Hudson’s grey set.No need here for the monumental complications that took the edge off the essential colour black of Calixto Bieito’s fierce Verdi over at ENO. These tones move from grey to magnesium-flare white, above all thanks to a huge lamp-light which rises and sets and oscillates like an unruly sun across and above the stage (anyone who’s seen Vick’s superb staging of Rossini’s Guillaume Tell at Pesaro, the production which should have come to Covent Garden, will have admired Giuseppe Di Iorio’s similar lighting there).Bass drums thunder a birth from the boxes either side of the stage; disturbing, tritone-based chords from the orchestra and offstage chorus - superb -  ease into clear triads, always luminous under Boder’s baton, single instruments making their mark with single notes. That great actor Klaus Maria Brandauer is just a little stagy in his declamation of English text and primal howls as old Olai trying to find out about the birth of son Johannes (Brandauer pictured above with Sarah Wegener as the Midwife). The words are often inaudible, and that's no fault of the orchestra, despite its density, ever being too loud. He says “I can’t hear anything” so often that if you don’t immediately get the point – I didn’t – you wish this was a Beckett-like monologue declaimed by John Hurt or Ian McKellen against a background of silence.That’s to reckon without Olai’s disappearance not long into the constantly shifting score. The child is now a fisherman on the last day of his life, or maybe unknowingly already dead. Baritone Christoph Pohl takes over, singing a German text, and he’s compelling as Johannes: still but perplexed, sensing the ghost voices of his dead wife Erna (contralto Helena Rasker) and best friend Peter (tenor Will Hartmann, just occasionally strained; all three pictured below). These are the first developed songlines we’ve had since the beginning of a score that has been all sustained chords with weird bends between notes; occasionally the instruments join the singers in some surprisingly Straussian modulations. Haas’s figures on the grey canvas are never static, metamorphosing in far more interesting ways than a minimalist score; gradually we notice that the objects and the lamp-light are rotating too.The music becomes almost human for duets in which Fosse harps on ordinary phrases about life, like Johannes’s pride that he and Peter have always cut each other's hair, or his daughter Signe (also played by Wegener) singing how she likes to stop by her father’s house daily and “have a little chat with you”. But Signe is the one person on this side whom Johannes must leave behind. Light, voices and music in extreme registers take us into the deepest, which is also the lightest, part of the opera. What happens to the English translation projected on the back wall by 59 Productions is equally haunting.This, it’s clear, is what Haas and Fosse imagine it might be like to die. Attractive as the ""all is one"" philosophy may be, we may beg to differ when it comes to what if anything lies beyond, but the great thing about music drama, even one as arcane as this, is that it makes you believe for the duration. Haunting rather than moving, the whole immersion is something you have to experience. The BBC Radio 3 broadcast on 5 December should find this meta-opera at home in a different way; don't miss it in either form.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/morgen-und-abend-royal-opera,4
264,"L'Ospedale, Wilton's Music Hall",L'Ospedale,Wilton's Music Hall,2015-11-13,alexandra Coghlan,"Anyone lamenting the current trend for “wellness” and other associated holistic, pseudo-medical fads might want to take themselves for a medicinal trip down to Wilton’s Music Hall for L’Ospedale. There you will discover (best keep the homeopathic drops handy) that 17th-century satirists were there long before fancy Surrey clinics got in on the action.Anonymous, one-act opera L’Ospedale is a sharply observed piece of social commentary – an operatic Private Eye, with its gaze turned mercilessly on the healthcare system. If that sounds bracing rather than delightful, it’s worth pointing out that the Cavalli-esque score is also rather lovely, and given a pretty unimprovable contemporary premiere here by the young musicians of baroque ensemble Solomon’s Knot.Set in a hospital, the opera sees four patients relate their (increasingly extreme) case histories to a doctor before each receiving their diagnosis. The elegant twist here is that the “doctor” is in fact an imposter – a politician disguised in order to take a closer look at the system his opening Commons speech (Health’s original prologue) took so vehemently to task.Wilton’s is an extraordinary venue, but like the Globe’s Wanamaker Playhouse that singularity comes at a price. It’s not an inert theatrical space. If you stage anything here you have to embrace the theatre’s own atmosphere, working in harmony with its shabby historical glamour or consciously chafing against it. Director James Hurley chooses the latter, but so emphatically, so aggressively unlovely are designer Rachel Szmukler’s visuals, so determined to obscure sightlines with strip-lighting and an awkwardly curtained in-the-round set, that the theatre becomes more intrusion that anything else.What this space does bring to the staging is a wonderful acoustic – studio-clean for solo singing, while ensemble passages ring with church-like resonance. Those 19th-century builders really knew what they were about. A superb cast makes the hall work its hardest for them, whether in the rhythmic clarity of James Halliday’s virtuosic band or the impeccably tuned clarity of two Gesualdo madrigals – moments of chromatic contemplation inserted into the otherwise sunny musical drama.  L’Ospedale really is an ensemble piece, and there’s plenty of generous interplay between the cast of six. Rebecca Moon’s lovelorn Innamorato is the first to tell her tale – a full-Monteverdi of a domestic tragedy, spiced with plenty of unrequited love. Her characterful, lived-in (and loved-in) soprano is set in relief by the purity of Lucy Page’s hospital worker Forestiero (pictured above), world-weary and drained of fight, but whose voice hints at some residual hope. Together they added a gorgeous metallic gloss to the Gesualdo motets in all their uncomfortable beauty.Quickly dashing initial hopes that he might be our sane guide in this asylum, Thomas Herford casts reason aside and delivers a grippingly deranged performance as Cortigiano, rivalled by Nicholas Merryweather’s mad-eyed Povero, though only outdone for sheer mania by Michal Czerniawski’s Matto. It’s a rich selection of solo voices, from Herford’s lyricism and long phrasing through Czerniawski’s piercing emotional directness to Merryweather’s generous muscularity, but most striking is the blend they achieve in ensembles. Anchoring all is Jonathan Sells’ baritone, bursting with plausible authority and slick lines (the ongoing selfie joke is a winner), he tips the scales of this satire almost level, balancing the insistent attacks of Antonio Abati’s libretto.I probably wouldn’t rush to hear L’Ospedale again. Anonymous by name, the score – while charming – is also fairly anonymous musically, lacking the melodic personality of a Cavalli or Cesti. Solomon’s Knot, on the other hand, have personality in buckets, and with a couple of London dates in the diary there’s every incentive to get to know this talented collective better.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/lospedale-wiltons-music-hall,4
265,"Tamerlano, Il Pomo d'Oro, Emelyanychev, Barbican",Tamerlano,Il Pomo d'Oro,2015-11-11,alexandra Coghlan,"The curse of Tamerlano strikes again. The last time London saw Handel’s darkest and most sober opera was in 2010. Graham Vick’s production for the Royal Opera House lost its unlikely star Placido Domingo before it even opened in London, ran interminably long and lost any emotional impetus somewhere in the course of its three-and-a-half hours. To say, then, that last night’s concert performance from Maxim Emelyanychev and Il Pomo d’Oro made an even poorer job of the piece is not to dismiss it lightly.The Barbican have fine form where baroque opera is concerned. We’ve become used to concert performances that are in fact semi-stagings – with the emphasis more or less on the “semi” – with props, basic sets and off-copy singers delivering fully dramatised performances. What we got last night was the laziest of concerts.Singers came and went seemingly at will, frequently absent when still implicated in the dialogue of others, making a mockery of any attempts at visual drama. And even when they were present, each was wedded to his or her music stand. None of this need have mattered had conductor Maxim Emelyanychev (pictured above) supplemented the lack of staging with vivid musical narrative. As it was, between recitatives that bagged and sagged under their own ponderous weight and senseless pauses for applause (even from Emelyanychev himself) and bows from the singers after every single aria, shattering Handel’s already fragmented drama, we were trapped in a second-rate concert that just refused to end.Then there was the casting. John Mark Ainsley is a peerlessly musical and sensitive singer, but an unlikely fit for the warrior-king Bajazet, tiptoeing where he needed to thunder. He was given little help by Emelyanychev, who, showing no sympathy for a lighter voice, encouraged the band with gestures more suited to Verdi than Handel, crushing Ainsley underfoot.Julia Lezhneva was the evening’s biggest disappointment, however. This young soprano’s voice has changed out of all recognition since she first sang at the Barbican only a handful of years ago, developing some terrible technical habits that have stunted its growth, and robbed it of all its natural freedom and certainty of intonation. With no bloom or spin on the sound, Lezhneva can only strike a note and hold it briefly, piano-like, leaving her cruelly exposed in slow arias, which tend flat and gripped, though she still just about gets away with the coloratura. Her Asteria, far from Handel’s assertive heroine, was timid and tight throughout, barely registering the presence of love-interest Andronico (Max Emmanuel Cencic).Cencic, together with fellow countertenor Xavier Sabata (pictured left), was the most vocally secure presence on stage, though determined to break any illusion of character by air-conducting his way through his every aria and losing a fair amount of language in his hazy diction. Musically, though, his Andronico was a worthy rival to Sabata’s Tamerlano, making this rocky bromance an unusually fair fight. Sabata is an endlessly watchable performer – relaxed and comfortable, though perhaps lacking the ferocity this psychopath needs to sustain well over three hours of cruelty and scheming.Il Pomo d’Oro themselves had all the sparkle we usually hear under director Riccardo Minasi, with beautiful solo moments for bassoon, flute and recorder adding colour to propulsive strings. Even their brilliance, however, could not raise this limp performance within a mile of the group’s stellar recording from 2014. Plead poor cast substitutions (swapping Karina Gauvin for Lezhneva was never going to be a fair swap) and, in the case of Ainsley, the difference between casting for studio and concert hall, but whichever way you spin it this was still a spectacularly poor performance, and one that failed to grasp the mature complexity and angular beauty of Handel’s opera.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/tamerlano-il-pomo-doro-emelyanychev-barbican,2
266,"The Force of Destiny, English National Opera",The Force of Destiny,English National Opera,2015-11-10,Gavin Dixon,"Verdi’s dark tale gets even darker in this new staging from Calixto Bieito. He updates the story to the Spanish Civil War, a setting with plenty of opportunity for his trademark violence but also offering illuminating parallels on the story itself. ENO has assembled a fine cast for the occasion, and the musical direction, from Mark Wigglesworth, is dynamic and dramatically engaged. The result is a staging that gives rare focus to this sprawling score, and to its grim implications of tragedy and fate.Bieito explains that the civil war setting offers a parallel to the central family drama of the opera: the Vargas family torn apart through their incapability for reconciliation. As in civil war, the enemy is within. Visually, the setting takes on a greying monochrome, partly referencing newsreel footage, but also Picasso’s Guernica, and at one point the image of a startled horse is projected against the backdrop to make that connection explicit. One area that doesn’t lend itself to subtlety is the evocation of fascism, and the first two acts are weighed down with oppressive back projections of goose-stepping soldiers and giant jackboots. There is also a book-burning, or at least tearing-up, scene in the second act that seems heavy-handed. But the civil war angle works, especially for the specific context it provides for the ill-defined wartime setting of the libretto.Three-storey terraced buildings dominate the stage throughout, two-dimensional facades, each supported behind by a small scaffold. The backs become as visible as the fronts, as each is moved around and, at one point, all are set in continuous rotation on the revolving stage. None of this adds much to the drama; the facades are set at oblique angles to convey the trauma of the fourth act, but are otherwise left to their own devices. They make for ambiguous scenarios, none of which do more than suggest the settings, but the abstraction allows the drama to take place on a more physiological level, its contexts more imagined than defined.Strong performances in the lead roles energise this staging from the start. The first act is dominated by the Leonora of Tamara Wilson (pictured above). She has a commanding voice, emotive and well-projected. It’s not especially pretty, but it’s ideal for the part. Both she and Gwyn Hughes Jones as Alvaro (pictured below) seem a little inhibited in this first act, but that may be deliberate: the starting-point in a long emotional journey. Jones has a strong, robust tenor, another excellent Verdi voice. Anthony Michaels-Moore (pictured top) is equally compelling as Carlo. His big aria in the second act is compromised by noisy book-tearing, but he has the vocal power to be heard above it all, and plenty more chances to shine later on.The ambiguous sets seem designed to deliberately compromise the sanctuary of the church, making this wartime environment even more hostile to Leonora. Her initiation into the hermitage is provocatively sadomasochistic, involving a barbed-wire crown of thorns (spoiler: she garrottes herself with it at the end – nasty). But there is humanity, and even humour, in the Father Superior of James Creswell and Melitone of Andrew Shore. Creswell hasn’t quite the profundo the role calls for, but plenty of authority nonetheless, and Shore makes the most of the relatively small part of Melitone, making a real character out of the conflicted and sarcastic friar.Act Three brings out Bieito’s more visceral instincts, with several instances of arbitrary violence. Preziosilla, the soldier’s widow inciting the troops, is a wholly unredeemed figure here, and Rinat Shaham’s icy performance and brittle tone are ideal. Some of the violence seems gratuitous and silly, like when she beats up a heavily pregnant woman while singing her first aria. But the “Rataplan” chorus works well as a gangland execution scene, Verdi’s music finally approaching the savagery that Bieito has been projecting on it.While some of the dramaturgy earlier on is hit-and-miss, this production comes into its own in the final act. Bieito has been described as the Quentin Tarantino of opera, and the epithet is fully vindicated here. He plays it like a Spaghetti Western, Carlo and Alvaro, the old adversaries, meeting in the ruins of a monastery for their final showdown. Anthony Michaels-Moore is compelling, a graphic portrayal of a psychosis induced by the quest for revenge. Bieito delivers a final elegant touch by setting the final scene, not in a hermit’s cave, but at the dining-table at which the first act played out, the chairs still in disarray from the shooting many years before.Subtleties like that are not what Bieito is known for, but they are everywhere apparent in this production. He is working here with a fine and dramatically engaged cast. Mark Wigglesworth directs a musical performance that is a little more grounded and safe than the production itself, although the balance between the two is effective. The orchestra plays well for him, although sometimes feels constrained by the sheer control he applies (and when he does loosen the reins, as in the third act bacchanal, the co-ordination suffers). But overall, this feels like a strong company project, with everyone at ENO committed to the vision of their enfant terrible director, even though this production shows worrying signs he might actually be growing up.@saquabote",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/force-destiny-english-national-opera,4
267,"The Drummer Boy of Waterloo, Jubilee Hall, Aldeburgh",The Drummer Boy of Waterloo,Jubilee Hall,2015-11-09,David Nice,"Back in 1949, Britten’s Let’s Make an Opera, with its enduring second part The Little Sweep, blazed a trail for children’s opera in Aldeburgh’s Jubilee Hall. Little has changed about this generously-sized village institute – a funding appeal for much-needed renovations is under way – and Jenni Wake-Walker’s Jubilee Opera is still waving the banner for music education with works that make the right sort of demands. The Drummer Boy of Waterloo, marking the bicentenary of that most famous of battles, is the latest.After Britten, this vital genre didn’t exactly flourish, in the UK at least – Finland has had an extraordinary tradition – but it made a comeback at Glyndebourne, where Drummer Boy’s conductor Lee Reynolds is the Music Director of the Youth Opera, and seems to be flourishing now across the country. The bravery of this newcomer, by Megg Nicol and David Stoll, is that it’s through-composed, with no spoken dialogue, keeps the ensemble of children working throughout, and doesn’t rely on adult opera singers to do more difficut stuff; there’s only one, Peter Brathwaite, admirable as mill owner Mr Lancashire, and in fact, were it not for the virtue of collaboration with a real opera-singer, his role could be taken by one of the teenage boys in the cast since it’s not larger than several of the others.We’re in a northern textile mill circa 1815 (pictured right by David Hernon). On their only free afternoon of the week, the children remember Edward Drew, who went off to the Napoleonic Wars to play the drum-signals on the battlefield. The singing of “Sunday” suggests we might be off to La Grande Jatte with Stephen Sondheim’s Seurat, but the songs which follow are more Boublil and Schonberg’s Les Mis in their foursquare style.Much of the musical interest lies in the links and their orchestration; down in the pit the 11-piece orchestra – another homage to Britten – is led by veteran violinist Kenneth Sillito, who’s witnessed many great things here, not least under the composer’s baton, since he first came to Aldeburgh in 1959. There are other distinguished names in the ensemble, too.Dramatically, you’re left fretting by the two-thirds mark of the hour-long show when we’ll get to Waterloo, since the mill action predominates. There’s only one short sequence towards the end, Into Battle, when the children balladize Edward’s second career. What happened? The pity of war and the boy-hero’s demise are not made clear – at least if they are, the pitiless acoustics of the Jubilee Hall stage, swallowing up so much of the sound in the wings, means the text can’t often be heard, and the lyrics printed in the programme don’t make it clear.The iniquities of child labour do have a voice in the mill scenes, but they’re still just a bit too cosy, more Oliver! than The Little Sweep: Britten managed eerie pathos so well, and there need to be a few more darker shades in this score. Still, it’s unstintingly democratic in its distribution of roles, with three children of different ages playing Edward at different stages of his short life, and only one clear stand-out, William Rose as the foreman Barley (pictured above with Brathwaite); I assume he’s the Will whose testimony is printed in the programme, a veteran of eight years with Jubilee Opera. Otherwise, what’s so impressive is that kids across a wide age-range had memorized a substantial amount of music and got to move around Claire Lyth’s well-dressed set confidently under Lucy Bradley’s direction, with a neat bit of choreography from Kieran Sheehan. It’s an experience they ought to remember for the rest of their lives.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/drummer-boy-waterloo-jubilee-hall-aldeburgh,3
268,"Le Donne Curiose, Guildhall School",Le Donne Curiose,Guildhall School,2015-11-05,David Nice,"Scintillating gems scattered rather thinly through long-winded operas: that superficial impression of Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari’s often delectable music isn’t going to be changed greatly by seeing his first success of 1903, Le donne curiose (“Nosy Women”, perhaps, or, if you want a better English title “The Merry Men of Venice”). It takes an enormous amount of charm to make you want to stay with this inconsequential adaptation of Goldoni – no proto-Feydeau when it comes to comic plotting – and fortunately this Guildhall team have it in spades.Perhaps a music college’s first duty to budding opera singers is to make them feel, or seem, comfortable on stage; their whole lives up to that point have been about studying music, not drama. Past student productions have pointed up the fact that if the performers aren’t relaxed enough not to overdo it, certainly in comedy, the audience won’t go with them. Last night, in a cast with a few first-rate replacements for Monday’s team A, director Stephen Barlow hit the mark throughout, making of the nine principals of uneven vocal talent a true ensemble. In this he was vibrantly assisted by Yannis Thavoris’s 1970s designs (did anyone else of my age have a bedroom entirely in orange?). The malleable set offers one remarkable coup, a swivel from club entrance to club proper, the sort of thing that would get Met audiences applauding. The gags, not least Arlecchino's fart to two bassoons and the threat of kicking a football into the audience, are always neatly timed to the music.Barlow's set-up is charming and funny. The first two-thirds of Wolf-Ferrari’s delightful Overture are accompanied by tourists buying carnival masks, postcards and gondoliers’ outfits from a Venetian shop while men furtively go through the door at the back and suspicious women try to see what’s going on. Then we have the film titles for an Italian sitcom, its stars grinning at the camera. The dramatis personae are assorted businessmen and their aides, and four women – two wives, a pert daughter and a mezzo servant (pictured left from top: Bethan Langford, Elizabeth Karanyi, Nicola Said and Katarzyna Balejko). The line-up of Verdi’s Falstaff, in short, without the main character – though one of the evening’s two most striking vocal stars, and certainly the most charismatic, bass-baritone Milan Sijanov as Arlecchino, could take on that role right now.The patter and parrying of Verdi’s miraculous last score are emulated, though not alas the pith; Wolf-Ferrari’s own dimension is an early neoclassicism pipping his fellow Italian-German Busoni to the post, well in advance of Strauss’s Ariadne auf Naxos and Stravinsky’s Pulcinella. It could have done with more spring and lightness of touch from Mark Shanahan in the pit, though he did get the Guildhall Orchestra to convey the atmosphere and romanticism of Act (here “Episode”) Three’s night in Venice. Goldoni’s 18th century inclusion of characters from the commedia dell’arte has to do without the original improvisation, but it’s fun to catch their Venetian dialect – and it’s a joy to hear well-projected and clearly well-understood Italian between two ENO operas doggedly in English (Puccini’s La Bohème and Verdi’s The Force of Destiny, opening on Monday). Language coach Matteo Dalle Fratte has done excellent work here.Nothing much happens: the men meet to eat pizza and to celebrate football, fast cars and amicizia (“friendship”); the curiosità of the women leads them to imagine floozies, occult dabbling and buried treasure. It takes them an awfully long time to see what’s through the keyhole, but most of that time – at least until the later stages of the last act – is beguilingly spent. Do the women get to join the club at the end? Of course not, but then this version is set in 1970s Italy, and to judge from RAI now, feminism still doesn't have that much of a hold there.It’s frustrating that Wolf-Ferrari refuses to settle on a proper set-piece or a musical highlilght in “Episode” One, but the second opens out to a wonderful ensemble around the spaghetti lunch in Eleonora’s kitchen, Wolf-Ferrari’s harmonic sideslips adding piquancy, and a very pretty duet for the young lovers. Vocally, second-cast tenor Elgan Thomas (pictured above with Nicola Said) steals the show here: he’s a fully-fledged tenore di grazia who can both grandstand, at least as much as the composer lets him, and sing sweet, soft nothings as girlfriend Rosaura (Nicola Said) hands him the lunchtime plates to dry.Of the women, Bethan Langford as chief housewife shows the most promise, but that’s almost irrelevant when they all work so well as an ensemble. There are other promising baritones among the men, whose characters aren’t so fully-fledged. Although it only has one chorus of even less consequence than the ones in Mozart’s Così fan tutte, Le donne curiose is otherwise the perfect opera for student teamwork. Next, please, if Glyndebourne won't do it, a double bill of Busoni’s Arlecchino and Turandot.Next page: listen to Toscanini conduct the Overture to Le donne curioseToscanini in 1947 conducting the Overture to Le donne curiose ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/le-donne-curiose-guildhall-school,4
269,"Tosca, Wales Millennium Centre",Tosca,Wales Millennium Centre,2015-11-03,stephen Walsh,"There’s a good deal to be said for semi-staged opera. It concentrates the mind in a particular way; it brings the orchestra more fully into the action; it moves the singers closer to the audience; and above all it reduces – even removes – the power of the director to superimpose some crackpot notion of his or her own on the dramaturgic design of the composer and librettist. Tosca, a work that in any case hardly lends itself to updating or relocation (though that hasn’t always stopped that happening), does on the other hand call for expert stage direction; and this is doubly the case with the singers confined to a narrow strip between the orchestra and the footlights.Everyone had come to the Wales Millennium Centre to hear Bryn Terfel, singing Scarpia a week before his 50th birthday. And they certainly weren’t disappointed; they heard him and he was on stunning form. But they got something more rounded and dynamic than a mere star vehicle. A strong cast all round gave a brilliant account of Puccini’s most melodramatic opera, presenting it as something altogether more substantial than the “shabby little shocker” of Joseph Kerman’s straight-faced Opera as Drama. And for this the director, Amy Lane (she was above all an enabler), deserves a lot of credit.Puccini has the voices front of stage but composed through the orchestraHer single miscalculation was to have the (excellent as ever) WNO chorus onstage for the offstage cantata in the second act; they inevitably drowned out the crucial interview between Scarpia and Cavaradossi. For the rest the ebb and flow of the plot was caught with precision and without distraction. Puccini’s theatrical genius was on full display; the fact that Tosca sheds no light on the refugee problem, Scottish independence, or gay marriage seemed not to matter too much.Musically what happens under these circumstances? Although, being Italian, Puccini always has the voices front of stage, he actually composed – like Wagner – through the orchestra. The work’s structure is a sequence of musical scene-changes, every one of them orchestral. It’s a technique that can pass half-unnoticed with the orchestra out of sight in the pit. But here it was visible as well as audible, and a powerful element in the stage narrative.How many non-musicians, for instance, normally attend to the beautiful quartet of solo cellos that accompanies Cavaradossi’s trading of his ring for the delivery of a last letter to Tosca? Here it was a visible dialogue between the incident (in the voice) and the emotion (in the orchestra: the theme is that of the love duet in Act 1). And there were countless other examples. For the singers, the proximity of the players clearly enhanced the sense of collaboration, not least thanks to some superb playing and Gareth Jones’s immaculate, painstaking conducting of the WNO orchestra.Terfel, in his most powerful voice, dominated the stage with this Scarpia that is demonic without quite growing horns and a forked tail: Iago taken on as chief of police. But the performance was made, just as much, by Aïnhoa Arteta's wonderfully mobile, richly coloured Tosca, and by the intensely personable Cavaradossi of Teodor Ilincăi (pictured above), a voice that grew in warmth and clarity as the evening went on. There were also some fine individual vignettes: notably Alun Rhys-Jenkins’s villainously impassive Spoletta, Romanas Kudriašovas’s surprisingly but not unconvincingly youthful Sacristan, and a beautifully sung, correctly youthful Shepherd Boy from Huw JonesIt would be great to see this lot in a fully staged production. But then the director would be taking a bow as well, and for what?",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/tosca-wales-millennium-centre,5
270,"Carmen, Royal Ballet",Carmen,Royal Ballet,2015-10-28,Jenny Gilbert,"Carlos Acosta is that rare 21st-century phenomenon – a performer who has become a household name without the help of reality TV. Even people who run a mile from ballet know the story of the Havana slum boy made good through perseverance and pure talent, from countless primetime documentaries as well as a self-penned book and stage show. The Royal Ballet cannot have imagined how things would turn out when it signed its first (and, to date, only) black principal 17 years ago. For the past decade or more Acosta has been a powerful magnet for new audiences and widely adored.All this has meant that Carmen, his swansong project before his planned retirement from dancing next year, has been borne along on a wave of goodwill. A 60-minute retelling of Mérimée’s story, stripped to its blazing essentials and set to a fresh orchestration of Bizet’s tunes – what could possibly go wrong? Almost everything, in the event. A treatment that set out to be thoroughly modern feels oddly old-fashioned, with its lace-undies sexuality and clunky eclecticism. The familiar score gets pulled about something rotten, with additions from off-stage choir, on-stage flamenco guitars and a line-up of Latin percussion complete with bongos. Now and again the dancing cast is infiltrated by opera singers – not a bad idea in itself, but woefully lacking continuity or point. On opening night there were communication difficulties, too, between the singers and the conductor, Martin Yates, whose orchestration it was.Yet the story is clearly told. Whereas the maverick Mats Ek, whose cartoon-brash Carmen was loathed as much as it was loved at the Opera House, made much of the subplot, Acosta cuts the action to its essentials. If the remaining three main characters retain any complexity at all, it’s by dint of nuanced acting – particularly from Acosta himself as Don José, a man who looks like a loser from the moment he allows Carmen to unbutton his military jacket.Marianela Nunez cannot be faulted on her commitment to the title role, so it seems a touch unfair to admit to disliking the character increasingly as the ballet progresses. But Carmen’s relentless tigerishness around men, her insatiability, is frankly tiresome, and you find yourself longing for her comeuppance. In the opera a thin layer of remove is created by the fact that seductiveness must be suggested through the voice. In a ballet, in this ballet anyway, the dancer’s body too readily assumes the postures of sex, and it’s too much. What’s more, Carmen and Don José’s grappling duets looked beetle-small on that huge stage. They may work better on screen, in close-up.Federico Bonelli’s preening toreador is very stylishly and amusingly done: on the whole, Acosta’s choreography for male characters is sharper than that for the women. Yet for the ensemble he fails to come up with any memorable ideas at all. Scooting about on wheeled chairs is old hat; girls standing astride their men and sticking their bottoms out is simply crass. Tim Hatley’s designs are mostly bold and straightforward, if unoriginal. Did anything ever happen in Spain that wasn’t under a blood-red lunar eclipse?Earlier, the evening had been a five-star affair, with a first Royal Ballet revival of Viscera, Liam Scarlett’s most accomplished abstract work to date. The piece takes its cue from a piano concerto by the American Lowell Liebermann that sounds like Shostakovich on speed. Scarlett matches its stabbing strings and tumbling piano clusters with fierce pirouettes, flashing six-o’clock legs and lifts that drop like a stomach in a lift. Its melting middle movement showed Leticia Stock to be a fast-rising talent.The class act continued with a brace of American pas de deux that shone like two bright stars. Many will cherish the memory of Carlos Acosta in Jerome Robbins’ Afternoon of a Faun. Here it was the turn of newly ultra-fit Vadim Muntagirov to display his bare torso to best effect in the invisible dance studio mirror. The nice conceit is that the audience is that mirror, as the boy and his dream girl (Sarah Lamb, pictured above) limber up and inspect their line. Even when they finally touch they keep an eye on how cute they look together. Archly witty and beautiful, delivered with a drop of ice.The Tchaikovsky pas de deux is a George Balanchine genuflexion to high Russian classicism set to music discarded from Swan Lake. Long-limbed Natalia Osipova would have been an intriguing match for neat Steven McRae, but she had taken herself off to Moscow to be replaced by tiny Iana Salenko, an increasingly regular RB guest with superbly neat feet and the spring of a baby gazelle. Together, they soared. What a pity that Acosta’s Carmen never achieved take-off.",https://theartsdesk.com/dance/carmen-royal-ballet,3
271,"Le Pré aux Clercs, Wexford Festival Opera",Le Pré aux Clercs,Wexford Festival Opera,2015-10-28,alexandra Coghlan,"“No courtier or lady’s champion would dream of fighting a duel anywhere else…” The setting for duels, liaisons, champagne and love, Paris’s Pré aux Clercs gives its name to Ferdinand Herold’s almost-comic 1832 opera – a welcome mood-lightener in this season’s otherwise tragic fare at the Wexford Festival. But though the piece does end in marriages rather than deaths (at least, for those who matter), it’s not quite the uncomplicated piece of silliness we might expect, or hope, from such a staple of the Opéra Comique.The context – France’s 16th-century Wars of Religion – offers not only echoes of Meyerbeer’s Les Huguenots but also hints of the strife to come in a love-intrigue where religion as well as romance is at issue. Marguerite de Valois and her lady-in-waiting Isabelle are diplomatic prisoners at the French court, high-ranking bargaining counters in the conflict between the Catholic Henri III (Marguerite’s brother) and the Protestant King of Navarre (Marguerite’s husband). Though courted by the swashbuckling Comte de Comminges, Isabelle is in love with her childhood friend the Baron de Mergy. When the latter in conveniently sent as an envoy to Paris they must contrive to marry before Isabelle is forced into an alliance with Comminges against her will.It is impossible to overstate the popularity of Hérold’s work in France, not only in its day but right up until the mid-20th century. By 1950 Le Pré aux Clercs had racked up over 1,600 performances at the Opera-Comique – astonishing for a work that has subsequently dropped into obscurity faster than a defenestrated Frenchman. Revived here in partnership with the Palazzetto Bru Zane, the work reveals a handful of charming arias and some attractive ensembles, but fails to raise the pulse as other Wexford rarities have.Eric Ruf’s production plays it straight, giving Le Pré the pretty, period treatment. A courtly masquerade comes complete with Harlequins and Columbines, Marguerite sports a succession of impressive velvet farthingales, while a comic sub-plot between country innkeeper Nicette and her fiancé Girot comes embellished with set-piece songs and dances.It’s all terribly charming, but coupled with Hérold’s sugary score – vividly championed here by conductor Jean-Luc Tingaud and the Wexford Festival Orchestra – I question whether it’s judged correctly for contemporary audiences. Strong performances from a fine, French-speaking cast (there’s a lot of dialogue to get through) help it remain buoyant here, however, and bring essential sincerity to the sillier proceedings.Act I offers little opportunity for Marie-Eve Munger’s Isabelle (pictured left) to shine, but Act II opens with an elegant cavatina-cabaletta showstopper, showing off the soprano’s effortless upper register and coloratura agility. An appealing presence, Munger carries the emotional weight of the central love story. Nico Darmanin’s Mergy works very hard, but on this second night his vocal performance was under-projected and lacking in heroic heft. It’s hard to believe in his duelling defeat of Dominique Côté’s gloriously overwrought, tightly-wound Comte de Comminges – all vocal muscularity and hot temper.The role of Marguerite is more spoken than sung, but mezzo Marie Lenormand makes tremendous impact, warmly imperious as the political fairy-godmother of the piece, and adding personality to Hérold’s many trios and ensembles. Her acid interplay with Eric Huchet’s Cantarelli – the court’s bibulous Italian master of ceremonies – helps temper the opera’s more pastel-coloured pastoral moments.Strong support from Magali Simard-Galdes’s perky, soubrette Nicette (her wedding song is a highlight) and her tetchy Girot (Tomislav Lavoie) round out the operatic picture – a Watteau or Fragonard, decorative, elegant, but ultimately unmemorable.@AlexaCoghlan",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/le-pr%C3%A9-aux-clercs-wexford-festival-opera,4
272,"The Turn of the Screw, Aurora Orchestra, LSO St Luke's",The Turn of the Screw,Aurora Orchestra,2015-10-27,David Nice,"A Hawksmoor church ought to be the right setting for the psychological terror of Britten’s great chamber opera, a slanted but still chilling adaptation of Henry James's novella. True, the once-deroofed interior has been coolly revamped as a rehearsal and performance venue, but imaginative lighting and a clear acting space, with room for a 13-piece ensemble to the side, ought to do the trick.Unfortunately this setting, straight from Aldeburgh, isn’t exactly that for what its ""conceivers"" describe as “not a conventionally staged production… not ‘semi-staged’, nor… a concert performance”. It’s static and hems in the imagination rather than letting it flow as power play between the characters shifts, or ought to.The latticed cube within which most of the performers exist refers both to the child Flora’s cat’s cradle and to the labyrinth in which the protagonist finds herself lost at the beginning of the second act. It's the work of those “conceivers”, Sophie Hunter, Andrew Staples – the most imaginative of tenors, too, singing ghost Quint and the Prologue here – and William Reynolds. The concept has been executed, and brilliantly, by La Fura dels Baus’s Valentina Carrasco in Lyon. But that was dynamic, catching up objects as well as people as the screw turned. Here, while the ghosts first appear, and the children go through rituals, outside the cube, four of the perfomers are stuck rigidly, for most of what they sing, in fixed places behind music stands. The beyond doesn't make for effective glimpses of ""the others"" before they sing - a glaring light obscured the figures, and since St Luke's makeover has spiral staircases, why not have Quint in a tower as specified rather than on the ground?Using scores was the biggest mistake. Sophie Bevan, convincing in every word and every colour as the mind-besieged Governess, certainly didn’t need one; Ann Murray (pictured right), still inflecting with an intelligence and subtlety that suggests housekeeper Mrs Grose understands more than she says, knows her role well. Both ghosts, Staples and Jane Irwin as the former governess complicit in his nameless malignity, projected some wonderful sounds but weren’t note or rhythm perfect last night. Perhaps there hadn't been enough rehearsal time to embed Britten’s superb speech melodies sufficiently deep in their consciousness. And if I say I could sing you the Prologue note for note, that’s not to boast but to point out that like Cole Porter, Janáček or Sullivan setting Gilbert, Britten sets the words so memorably that they embed themselves in the psyche very quickly.Bevan convinced us of that, capable of soft and melting tones as well as pure white notes but opening up to scary forcefulness from the point at which the Governess jumps to conclusions about what has been happening to the orphan children at Bly and makes her fatal resolve to protect them at any cost. Every phrase has meaning, every top note rings out with that bloom which saw her Sophie stealing the show in Der Rosenkavalier both at ENO and in Birmingham.Unfortunately Bevan's positioning, the furthest back behind the orchestra, excluded both any ambiguity about whether her imagination is running havoc and the ghosts do exist, and any sense of her coming unwholesomely closer and closer, like Quint, to her charge Miles. Something’s wrong when in the bedroom scene Staples’ seducer hovers above the boy while the Governess is stuck at her post way behind (pictured below, Staples and a distant Bevan).The children, Joshua Kenney and a girl rather than a developed soprano, Louise Moseley, as Flora, were scoreless – young Joshua could have done with the prompt in the crucial final scene last night – but musically spot-on, even if this Miles is the kind of cipher on which you project your own imagination. Their rituals are sometimes perceptive, as in the initial reversal of the sexes in their bowing and curtseying, but more often constricting; this concept, like the ghosts and the Governess, never lets them just be normal children.Having the players at the front of the cube allows countless miracles of orchestration to make an even greater mark than usual – the sombre string clashes and high-cello weirdness, the unusual threatening quality of the celesta played by John Reid, whose pianism is astoundingly vivid, the amazing harp writing exquisitely taken by Sally Pryce. But total clarity also means a lack of mystery, and though Nicholas Collon, after a disappointing Glyndebourne-on-Tour Rape of Lucretia, is pitch- and pace-perfect, my flesh crept only when all the voices combined in a sensuous orgy at the end of Act One and at Bevan’s desperation. With her sister Mary hopefully recovering her voice over at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, and Louise Alder in that same Orpheus clearly the next in lyric line, we're so lucky with our home-grown sopranos at the moment.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/turn-screw-aurora-orchestra-lso-st-lukes,3
273,"Das Liebesverbot, Chelsea Opera Group, Cadogan Hall",Das Liebesverbot,Chelsea Opera Group,2015-10-26,David Nice,"Castanets in Wagner? The imperfect Wagnerite will identify them in one place only: the Venusberg ballet music of the Paris Tannhäuser. The perfect variety will know that they’re also to be found in the overture and carnival scene of Das Liebesverbot (The Ban on Love). Would that the rest of Wagner’s second opera were as wacky, but it’s still something to find the 21-year-old composer grappling with the German equivalent of an opéra comique or a dramma giocoso. We only got that overture in Wagner anniversary year, conducted by Mark Wigglesworth at the Proms, since a complete staging in Sussex was cancelled. Now the ever-intrepid Chelsea Opera Group has stepped boldly into the breach for one concert performance with a fine cast and a master Wagnerian at the helm.In style, the work is closer to an Italian rarity presented by COG last November, Foroni’s Cristina, Regina di Svezia than to Wagner’s first opera, Die Feen, which proved intermittently more startling in their 2013 concert performance. Though Foroni was more experienced in orchestral terms, there’s the same reasonably effective use of set-pieces, from arias to big ensembles, but nothing inspired or very memorable to fill them. Introductions and transitions are the most interesting: the prelude to the convent scene has that same seraphic treatment of the “Dresden amen” later engaged for Tannhäuser’s narrative of his pilgrimage to Rome, and there’s the occasional piquant use of woodwind.One leitmotif punctuates the score: the stern decree of the German viceroy that there should be no sex or revelling in Palermo. This is Wagner’s version of Shakespeare’s Measure for Measure, where “mortality and mercy in Vienna” are translated to fun-loving Sicily under joyless Teutonic rule (the original alternative title was The Novice of Palermo; I'd paraphrase a line from the chorus and make it Palermo Has a Right to Love). The core remains: novice Isabella pleads with the rigid deputy for the life of her brother Claudio, and when Friedrich, as Angelo becomes here, warms to her plaint in the wrong way, she resorts to the “substitute bed trick” of sending the woman he discarded, Marian(n)a, to the assignation in her place.The scene of Isabella’s urging is central to the Act One finale, as telescoped a version of Shakespeare as Verdi’s first Iago-Otello confrontation but with only a generic soaring melody for Isabella as some kind of recompense. Here as elsewhere in COG’s performance, we have a soprano of clarion charisma, Helena Dix, and the real bass article in David Soar (pictured above), on a roll since I first heard him as the Watchman in the Welsh National Opera Meistersinger, to render it reasonably convincing.Dix made her name here and in Wexford as Foroni’s queen; she's also being lined up for big Italianate things at the Met. In Wagner she seemed to me more impressive, personable and occasionally witty in this demented role which veers from Beethoven's Leonore – another strong woman out to save a condemned prisoner close to her heart – to bel canto heroine and even French comic minx (you have to laugh when Isabella gets all devious to end the first act; Dix had a ball winking and grinning). The gleaming if slightly metallic middle register gives great focus to intelligent recitative, and all the top notes work for her. I wanted to hear more of poised and lovely Wagnerian lyric soprano Kirstin Sharpin as Mariana (pictured above) – a fellow novitiate duetting with Isabella in Wagner’s version, Sieglinde to Dix’s Brünnhilde – but she does get an Elsa-like number in the final scene which is as close as we come in this opera, along with the duet, to the melting mood.Quality is also there in the male line-up. Soar dominates with more than a touch of villainous sex-appeal but Peter Hoare is in top gear as somewhat marginalized Claudio, the second tenor Paul Curievici a bit too much so, forcing what we know is a fine sound a little too much but carrying off the carnival ballad with great aplomb. Another tenor, Julian Hubbard, had little chance to shine as servant Pontio Pilato, but made his mark all the same. Nicholas Folwell as the semi-comic captain Brighella is a seasoned Wagnerian, and the language shows it, though occasionally he slipped out of sync with an even more experienced interpreter of the composer, conductor Anthony Negus, who certainly got the COG strings, waxing impressive on each new performance, to phrase idiomatically in the few German-Italian soarings (the best is in the overture).This was a rewarding opera for the chorus, too, who threw themselves with rough spirit into the chatterings of the carnival revelry. Thanks to Negus’s extensive cuts, the whole thing had an impressive shape and didn’t outstay its welcome. I wouldn’t want to hear it again, but this was certainly more than ticking the box of the one Wagner opera that hasn't been done here since 1965.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/das-liebesverbot-chelsea-opera-group-cadogan-hall,3
274,"The Tales of Hoffmann / Werther, English Touring Opera",The Tales of Hoffmann / Werther,English Touring Opera,2015-10-25,Richard Bratby,"It would spoil the surprise to say what exactly emerges when – after a breathless build-up and a few glimpses of a seductive silhouette – the living doll Olympia finally makes her entrance in Act One of English Touring Opera’s new production of Offenbach’s The Tales of Hoffmann. Let’s just say that it’s startling, beautiful, strange and ever-so-slightly spooky. In a word: uncanny. In an even better word: Hoffmannesque. The audience gasped, and James Bonas’s production found its stride.The Tales of Hoffmann(*****) is the centrepiece (with Debussy's Pelléas et Mélisande and Massenet’s Werther) of ETO’s all-French autumn programme, and it’s easily the most successful of the three. Bonas’s starting point is that Hoffmann is a silent movie director, his Stella (what else?) a star. The scenes that establish this idea are actually the least effective, notwithstanding brief mentions of Cecil B DeMille and Los Angeles in the translation (both Hoffmann and Werther are sung in English). But it’s a handy excuse to unlock a phantasmagoria of cinematic references: everything from Nosferatu and the Marx Brothers to Spielberg’s A.I. and Tim Burton (and there’s definitely more than a hint of Gene Wilder about Sam Furness’s Hoffmann). Oliver Townsend’s set transforms from sepia-toned film studio to the 19th century gothic of Crespel’s house and the garish retro-kitsch of Giulietta’s Venetian bordello.It’s a tribute to Bonas’s direction that all these influences come together so brilliantly and subversively: a multi-layered drama of identity and obsession disguised as terrific fun. Insights and images just keep coming, yet once Hoffmann starts telling his tales, they all serve a purpose, whether the spiralling eyeballs of Spalanzani’s laboratory, the distortions of a fairground mirror, or Nicklausse (Louise Mott, totally owning her oversize schoolboy costume) puncturing a moment of high drama by sitting glumly at the back, sucking on a lollipop throughout. This production is exuberant with its ideas, frequently magical to look at, and deeply rooted both in the imaginative world of the real Hoffmann and Offenbach’s glittering, endlessly inventive score.It helps that Bonas has such a strong cast - even roles such as Cochenille/Frantz (Matt R J Ward – whose comic timing stays precisely the right side of hammy) and Crespel (Kieran Rayner, substituting handsomely for Tim Dawkins, and coming across as the only entirely sane character in the whole thing) are vividly drawn. If the evening belongs to any one singer, though, it’s Warwick Fyfe as Lindorf and his triple alter-egos (his Doctor Miracle with Ilona Domnich's Antonia pictured above). Lurching about the stage with a sonorous, velvet-black baritone and a nice line in reptilian hisses and cackles, he brings an eerie chill with each entry, even before (with help from Mark Howland’s strikingly imaginative lighting) he morphs into a full-blown creature of the night.As the multiple heroines, Ilona Domnich seems most at home as a poisonously sensuous Giulietta; her creamy tone makes for a more warm-blooded-than-usual Olympia and an ardent, impetuous Antonia. Sam Furness’s tenor as Hoffmann (pictured below with Fyfe as eye-laden Doctor Coppelius) sounds almost too seductive for a serial romantic failure. This is a voice with star quality, and Furness can float it delicately over a final chord as readily as he can send it slamming to the back of the hall. No matter; his Hoffmann is anything but one-note. With the final image of him sprawled, wasted, on the floor of his studio, gazing at his flesh-and-blood Stella through a torn cinema screen, reality finally seems to arrive: and along with it, the realisation that we’ve just seen two and a half hours of ETO pretty close to the peak of its game.Philip Sunderland conducts with bubbling verve, and after a few fluffed notes at the start, his players sounded like they were enjoying every note of Stephen Brown’s colourful reduced scoring. ETO’s use of reduced orchestrations is occasionally described as an artistic compromise. In fact they’re the basic premise upon which productions like these are conceived, and when they result in work of this quality and ambition (neither Hoffmann nor Werther has received a professional production in the Midlands this century) I wouldn’t presume to second-guess ETO artistic director James Conway’s judgement of what’s realistically do-able in the pit at (say) the Gala Theatre, Durham or the Theatre Royal, Bath.Or, indeed, why it’s necessary to have the four-piece orchestra on stage in Werther (***). Scored for a piano trio plus clarinet, Ian Farrington’s arrangement is intended (according to Conway) to evoke “the distinctive sound of French chamber music”. But introducing a piano to the sound-world severs any last connection with the orchestral original - nothing says “nineteenth century romantic orchestra” less than a piano – and strips away a layer of lyricism. Add the decision to cast a baritone rather than a tenor as Werther – an option authorised by Massenet himself – and a luscious romantic star-vehicle becomes a conversational chamber drama: a Werther in coloured pencil rather than oils.Having made those choices, director Oliver Platt runs with them – at least as far as his concept allows. We’re in a 1950s-ish American Midwest; or at least a version of it in which children sing Christmas carols in French and volumes of Ossian are on every sideboard. Vintage bric-a-brac gives a realistic look to Townsend’s homely set (as long as you ignore the four musicians by the back door), and the lead roles are taken by plausibly young singers.Ballard plays Werther as a nerd-turned-stalker in beatnik specs, with a raw edge to his voice, while Carolyn Dobbin’s volatile Charlotte (pictured right with Lauren Zolezzi's Sophie by Robert Workman) sings in tones that suggest a Carmen or Amneris, at her best in moments of emotional strain or whispered tenderness. Their scenes together generate a voltage that’s just high enough to be dangerous. Simon Wallfisch as Albert flips plausibly from smug-married to predatory thug. Only Lauren Zolezzi (Sophie), though, really gives the impression that she’s able to meet all of Massenet’s vocal demands, pealing out her high notes with smiling charm.Yet somehow, for all its conviction and imagination, it doesn’t quite cohere. Maybe emotions as supercharged as Werther’s demand the perspective that a more traditional staging allows; maybe it’s just the gradual build-up of small misfires – Platt’s tendency to stand singers at the edge of the stage, gesticulating; or a clunky translation of the “Yes, it is I!” variety. And maybe this is nit-picking at a sincere, intelligent production, filled with real pleasures, of an opera that no national company is ever likely to tour to Malvern, Buxton, Durham or Bath. More, please, from these artists: on present form, a near-miss from ETO is infinitely more worth seeing than another safe revival from a company with twenty times the budget.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/tales-hoffmann-werther-english-touring-opera,
275,"Orpheus, Royal Opera, Sam Wanamaker Playhouse",Orpheus,Royal Opera,2015-10-24,David Nice,"It’s Orfeo in the original Italian: not Monteverdi’s, nor yet another version of Gluck’s Orfeo ed Euridice, but a cornucopia of invention in the shape of the first Italian opera for the French court. When the Ensemble Correspondances presented its very much slimmed down version of a 13-hour “Ballet Royal de la nuit” for Louis XIV at the Chaise-Dieu Festival this August, it was the fragments of ravishing music from Luigi Rossi’s work which stood out among the six featured composers. Furnishing a finer line-up of soloists than the French group could muster, the Royal Opera’s second opera to be staged in the candlelit intimacy of the Sam Wanamaker was the complete vindication of Rossi.It could have been a mess with lovely moments. Francesco Buti’s elaborate libretto throws in Venus, Cupid, the Graces, gossip-god Momus and a rival lover for Eurydice before the ill-fated maid dies at the end of Act Two. Director Keith Warner might have weighed down a production on a bigger stage with a cluttered concept as he had the Royal Opera Ring and Wozzeck. But in the helpfully limited stage space of the Wanamaker, he simply came up with something very lively and fluid, with adaptable tables and benches and stylish costumes from Nicky Shaw – more court of Charles II as befitted the venue than Louis XIV.If occasionally it was all a bit over-gestural, and the dances choreographed by Karl Alfred Schreiner didn't amount to much, we weren’t going to mind too much given a consummate cast, many not long out of music college – four of the women bright young stars from Australia, and the melting beauty of Christian Curnyn’s Early Opera Company Orchestra up in the gallery (a very warm welcome back to one of early music’s true heroes after too long an absence). And what opportunities Rossi gives them, including three great laments and a mad scene.For once, we really care about Eurydice, who hangs around long enough to be the star of the opera’s first half, proclaiming energetically like Auden’s Anne Trulove, “If love be love, it will not falter”. Louise Alder (pictured in both images above), who most recently sang the maid Lucia in Fiona Shaw's production of The Rape of Lucretia, turns in an incandescent, richly coloured and urgent performance, which confirms her as the brightest lyric soprano of the younger generation (fresh from covering Sophie in Glyndebourne’s Der Rosenkavalier and singing the role at the Proms, she joined the ensemble of Frankfurt Opera and has already performed major roles there). Her passacaglia-aria and death scene would have been outstanding in any opera, any production; how consummately, too, she handled the dream sequence – hauntingly staged – and the tragicomic scene in which Euridice refuses to have the fatal snake venom sucked out of her by Venus-backed Aristaeus.As that hapless would-be lover, Caitlin Hulcup showered warm mezzo riches on us at thrilling close quarters. Of the two original castrato roles, that of Orpheus is the higher, and should have been sung by Mary Bevan, swapping over from Eurydice in the Royal Opera's Monteverdi Orfeo. I don’t mean to disparage her known charms when I say that a throat infection which left her not singing but acting, very convincingly, gave us a chance to hear a new soprano of true individuality, Siobhan Stagg, delivering the part from above with stunning middle-range clarity and impeccable style (she’ll be vocalizing Orpheus for the next four performances).There were more ravishments from the ladies’ trio of Jette Parker Young Artists Lauren Fagan, Jennifer Davis and Emily Edmonds doubling the Graces and the Fates – the red rope cued links with Wagner’s Norns and Warner’s Ring, of course – who get the most individual number in the show at the beginning of Act Three, gone too soon.Character turns from fashion-model-esque Sky Ingram’s spiteful Venus, Keri Fuge’s plucky Cupid (the two pictured left), Graeme Broadbent outstandingly basso-profundo as Pluto and singular tenor Mark Milhofer’s Momus/Venus-as-old-woman, added to the rich mix. The ensemble numbers, above all the lamentations at the end of Act Two, provided another tingle-quotient at close quarters.English translation was the right decision under the circumstances, and Christopher Cowell’s work was as witty as his definitive Ariadne on Naxos. It simply gave one more kick to the peerless musical credentials and direct communication of this winning entertainment, perhaps the best and certainly the most surprising of the Royal Opera's Orpheus offerings. If there were a CD of this company's Orpheus I'd buy it now.David Nice's blog post on Louise Alder covering and performing the role of Sophie in the Glyndebourne Der Rosenkavalier",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/orpheus-royal-opera-sam-wanamaker-playhouse,4
276,"La Bohème, English National Opera",La Bohème,English National Opera,2015-10-17,David Nice,"Kurt Cobain’s “Smells like Teen Spirit’ cued a realistic song and drink routine for Chekhov’s Three Sisters in a hit-and-miss update by director Benedict Andrews. This one, with a Puccini soundtrack unsupportively conducted by Xian Zhang, smells more like routine spirit with a couple of jolts along the way, a sludgy requiem for drug-fuelled twenty-somethings.Moving forward in time the action of Puccini’s inspiration, Henri Murger’s still fresh and authentic memories of bohemian youth in 1830s Paris, is more the rule than the exception now. The late Steven Pimlott did it with more infill at ENO than his successor Jonathan Miller; David McVicar made it real and contemporary at Glyndebourne, but a DVD of Baz Luhrmann’s Opera Australia production shows that his is the one we should have had here.Fellow Antipodean Andrews lends another turn of the screw by having Rodolfo conjure his poetic “castles in the air” by getting new acquaintance Mimì to pull the rubber tight around his arm while he injects; she knows what to do, it seems, and he returns the compliment. So they get their “romance” in Puccini’s wonderful construction of two aria-narratives and a duet on a high, while the audience can only be turned off by what should be touching, unassisted love at first sight (Winters and Borichevsky pictured below).At least you don’t have to take the moonlight literally, if it's part of the fix, while it’s been a bit hard to accept any fumbling in the dark when it’s still a winter’s day beyond the frosted studio windows and only the characters are in silhouette (hard to see Rodolfo’s face for the first 10 or so minutes). Amanda Holden's not always well-fitting translation caters for some of the updated details (a pink wig for Mimì rather than a bonnet; no stairs for her to climb to the artists' studio).Musically, all is not right at this point either. Zach Borichevsky’s tall, handsome poet has a lightish and mostly pleasing tenor voice not sufficiently grounded to guarantee support; one can only presume he got the crucial top C before the first night (if it's a risk, there's no need for the traditional tenuto on the quaver not in Puccini's score). When he didn't last night, Zhang should have had the theatrical nous to move straight on, but waited for applause that didn’t come, and then failed to lend sympathetic support to Corinne Winters’ dark-voiced “They call me Mimì”, vocally a much more secure proposition.Zhang is a conductor with good symphonic instincts, aided by ENO strings on glowing current form, but very little operatic experience. It sounds like she’d been listening to Karajan’s opulent Puccini rather than Beecham’s authentic sparkle, and the singers were constantly left wanting to move the music-drama on. Darker in tone than when she sang Violetta for ENO, Winters really opens up in the third act, though it's a shame there's no real plangency in the voice, and again her aria of farewell was disastrously out of synch last night with the orchestra, for which Zhang must take the blame. You might do better to pick a performance when house conductor Martin Fitzpatrick takes over; he'll have a much better idea how to co-ordinate singers and players in an effectively flowing whole.The third act is generally cleaner and clearer, if along more traditional lines. Johannes Schütz's set designs and Jon Clark's lighting at last achieve some atmosphere. The Café Momus act before it, though, is a mess. Since it launches, after too long a curtain-down, on the drugged lovers still lying on the floor of the studio, you think it might be a hallucination, but apparently not – just a loosely directed nightmare with too much vaguely happening at the front of the stage. Our pair soon show no signs of their recent hit. Rhian Lois (pictured above), always a sparky singing actress, brightens things up with her Musetta, but why choose a light soprano voice when you could have a fuller-toned, more realistic characterisation of a girl who may be mixed-up but is capable of deeper feelings and may really love her Marcello?Neither do the other Bohemians quite make the impact they should. There’s a dangerous spread in Duncan Rock’s voice now, though his Marcello is likeable; Ashley Riches’ Schaunard has a more present sound than Nicholas Masters as Colline, and the Act Four horseplay is lively, but still not enough.By Act Four, despite the revelation that this is no garret but a ground-floor lodging with kids playing in leafy grounds outside, it’s Bohème-by-numbers. Puccini’s subtle depiction of friends gathering round to do all they can for the dying Mimì should be fairly indestructible, and Andrews thankfully doesn’t meddle with it. Still, I wonder if there was a wet eye in the house last night. It looks like it might be left to Richard Jones – due to stage a much-heralded successor to the John Copley stalwart at the Royal Opera next season – to say something really new but still true about this usually unsubduable masterpiece.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-boheme-english-national-opera-2,2
277,"Sweeney Todd, Welsh National Opera",Sweeney Todd,Welsh National Opera,2015-10-09,stephen Walsh,"If nothing else, Stephen Sondheim’s best-known work will put you off pies; it will put you off barbers; and it may in the end put you off Sondheim. Popular though it seems to be with planners and programmers, it’s sluggish and heavy going as drama and thin gruel as music: three hours of clever musical patter, repetitive orchestral mechanisms, and slinky variations on the “Dies irae”. When you’ve seen one throat-slitting, one human pie-bake, you’ve seen them all. And when you’ve heard the Ballad at the start of Act 1 and the waltz at the end of it (“A little priest”), you’ve heard most of what’s worth hearing in Sweeney Todd.I daresay this is too harsh a judgement on a composer who, Wagner-like but more catchily, writes his own brilliant lyrics, and has created a highly recognisable and effective semi-popular style somewhere between Cole Porter and Philip Glass. At his best Sondheim is distinctive, tuneful and memorable. But the stretch is too great, and well before the final corpse-scattered scene in James Brining’s new production for WNO I was shuffling my programme, glancing at my watch, and thinking about a vegetarian supper.Maybe the problem lies partly in the way an opera-house deals with musicals: no star performances, no spotlights (except here and there discreetly for chorus members), no drum-rolls. Perhaps also not enough cuts. The only concession to commercial habits is that the singers are miked; but not well enough to compensate for the tendency to sing down when you think the mike is doing the projection for you.moments of excellent black comedy, if inclined to wear thin after the umpteenth murderRightly, the production takes the work seriously and invites it to stand on its merits. It updates it a hundred years or so, but not distractingly or modishly. Colin Richmond’s single, wittily atmospheric set serves the piece well, with its basic London street and cutaway upstairs bedroom and barber’s saloon, from which Sweeney disposes of his customers down a chute that ends next to the baking oven. These are moments of excellent black comedy, if inclined to wear thin after the umpteenth murder. And Mrs.Lovett’s drawing-room furniture, straight from MFI, is a nice image of petit-bourgeois done-well-for-herself, thanks to the corpse pies.Janis Kelly (pictured right with David Arnsberger and pie) catches this image with precision, from the slatternly but twinkly purveyor of “The worst pies in London” to the not wholly passive recipient of Tobias’s affection in “Not while I’m around”. And her vocalising – soprano when required – is consistently stylish and to the point. But, within that idiom, the cast has no particular weakness, if no overpowering strength. David Arnsperger could be a more diabolical, perhaps noisier Sweeney, but gets the flavour of outraged sentiment taking drastic, sometimes unintentional revenge on its objects. George Ure is excellent as Tobias, in his one big number, but also as front man for the mountebank Pirelli (Paul Charles Clarke). Jamie Muscato is a likeable, if not specially fluent Anthony, Soraya Mafi a sweet, deliquescent Johanna, and there’s a touching vignette of her mother, reduced to penury, by Charlotte Page. Steven Page and Aled Hall, finally, are excellent as the corrupt Judge and his sidekick. Both end up coffined in pastry.James Holmes conducts, efficiently enough, though with a few problems of rhythm and ensemble not yet entirely solved. The WNO orchestra has been put through its paces these past weeks: Bellini, followed by Handel, followed by Sondheim. Their tolerance is obviously as strong as their versatility.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/sweeney-todd-welsh-national-opera,2
278,"Kiss Me, Kate, Opera North",Kiss Me,Kate,2015-10-04,graham Rickson,"Opera North have an excellent track record when it comes to staging musicals, and Jo Davies’s Kiss Me, Kate is among the best things they’ve done. Cole Porter’s score and lyrics are flawless, though the book (by husband and wife team Bella and Samuel Spewick) is a little clunky. Act 1 is overlong, and the show’s close is a tad perfunctory. But what an erudite, wise piece. Many successful new musicals are little more than jukebox compilations, whereas Kiss Me, Kate is a sophisticated, multi-layered drama, and one which expects its audience to have a working knowledge of Shakespeare. The smartest number in the whole show is delivered by a pair of hired thugs. How can anyone resist a musical whose lyrics rhyme 'puberty' with 'Schuberty', and which contains couplets like “Unless you know Shelley and Keats and Pope/Dainty Debbies will call you a dope”?Davies’ staging is thrillingly real. Backstage grubbiness is brilliantly evoked, and choreographer Will Tuckett’s contribution shines. “Another Op'nin', Another Show” must have taken weeks to assemble; that no characters collide is little short of miraculous. Despite the shabbiness and chaos, the backstage sequences have a colour and vibrancy that’s noticeably missing from the garishly lit scenes from The Taming of the Shrew that we see onstage. Colin Richmond’s stylish designs are effective, Padua effortlessly invoked with little more than a vast tapestry and some comically over-the-top Shakespearian costumes.Bernstein’s ghastly West Side Story recording demonstrates how operatic voices can wreck a piece of musical theatre. This production is very well cast; there’s no obvious divide between the classically and theatrically trained voices. Quirijn de Lang is a near-perfect Fred Graham/Petruchio. The backstage accent is flawless, the slicked hair and pencil moustache suggesting an arrogant leading man who fully deserves to be put through the mill. He’s got sufficient charisma to get away with a hideous pair of black leather trousers as Petruchio. Jeni Bern’s Lilli Vanessi/Kate is a terrific foil, imperious but vulnerable. Ashley Day’s Bill Calhoun/Lucentio, as the klutz whose unpaid gambling debt sets the backstage plot in motion, is a likeable presence. He also looks convincing in tights. His thunder is stolen by the brilliant Tiffany Graves as Lois Lane/Bianca (pictured above right, with Day), the ‘Broadway hoofer’ whose inexperience adds to the fun of the onstage action. “Always True to You in My Fashion” is a showstopper. As is Wayne Robinson’s “Too Darn Hot”, one of several numbers so laden with innuendo that you wonder how on earth they got past the censors in 1948. Joseph Shovelton and John Savournin (pictured below left) have fun as the pair of gunmen, never funnier than when they’re unwittingly squeezed into period costume at the end of Act 1.The strength of Porter’s score will surprise many. Wisely, he employed the great Robert Russell Bennett as his orchestrator, who in turn was helped by his colleague Don Walker. Celeste, guitar and mandolin all have their moments, and how wonderful to hear a full complement of winds and brass cushioned by a large string section. Conductor David Charles Abell uses the critical edition which he co-edited, opening up several cuts and reinstating an attractively quirky ballet sequence in Act 1. The supporting characters, however slight, all feel fully-formed. The chorus are a joy. Funny, smart and wise – this is a peach of an evening. Catch it while you can. And then see it again.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/kiss-me-kate-opera-north,5
279,"Salome, Bournemouth SO, Karabits, Symphony Hall, Birmingham",Salome,Bournemouth SO,2015-10-03,Richard Bratby,"“How fair is the Princess Salome tonight”! That slithering clarinet run, that glint of moonlight: few operas create their world so instantly and so intoxicatingly. At Symphony Hall, the lights rose on the very back row of the stage, the percussion riser serving as the terrace from which Andrew Staples’s Narraboth and Anna Burford’s Page exchanged their ecstasies and warnings. Beneath them, Kirill Karabits directed a surging, shimmering Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra with urgent, economical gestures. By the time Lise Lindstrom glided on downstage as Salome, the scope and quality of this concert performance of Richard Strauss’s breakthrough opera had already been impressively defined.Lindstrom seemed to pull the drama in around her in every scene in which she appeared. She stalked the platform, her movements calculated and taut, her eyes wary: Salome as wounded predator. Her tone wasn’t especially lush. What her voice had in abundance was focus and a sort of concentrated sensuality, just as potent and expressive whether hurling soaring arcs of sound at the back of the hall, or whispering a lethal threat. In the space of the one phrase “Gib mir den Kopf des Jokanaan” (“Give me the head of John the Baptist”, it modulated from luminous sweetness to a curdled snarl; and then again, and again - changing from sinister to savage as the Princess repeated her demand.Around a figure as compelling as Lindstrom, the limitations of the concert format hardly seemed to matter. Joe Austin directed, making effective use of basic coloured lighting and a few telling details of characterisation – James Rutherford’s hellfire-preacher hand gestures and blustering delivery as Jokanaan, Kim Begley’s self-satisfied manspreading as Herod – to lift this performance away from stand-and-deliver. Begley was very nearly as watchable as Lindstrom (the two pictured below). His wiry tenor fits Strauss’s brutal writing as comfortably as anyone’s ever could. He strutted complacently about the stage, eyes glinting with lust: a gloriously sleazy Tetrarch and – for once – a plausible match for Herodias. Birgit Remmert sang with such lustre in that role that at times she almost made her character seem likeable – then banished any thoughts of sympathy with the hissing malice of her low notes, as Salome pressed home her appalling final demand.The BSO played as if they were loving every single note – as well they might. Initially, there were balance problems (Staples and Burford were almost inaudible at times), and a tendency for the richer textures to become congested – both familiar issues when guest orchestras overcompensate for the Symphony Hall acoustic.Karabits quickly got that under control, and then let his team play out: a firm, satin-finished string section (the decision to split the violins revealed some usually unheard details), exuberantly characterful woodwinds and a tuba player who deserved a solo bow in his own right.This wasn’t a particularly refined Salome, but it was a dazzlingly colourful one. Karabits seemed to take an almost tactile pleasure in a trumpet’s peacock-squawk or the blinged-up glitter of celeste and harp. And the way he handled the sweep of Strauss’s final sequence, pushing headlong into Salome’s dance, and letting the ensemble run off the leash as Strauss’s harmonies strain ever closer to collapse – well, for drama, no concert performance can ever be an adequate substitute for a full staging. But this came damned close. MORE RICHARD STRAUSS ON THEARTSDESKDer Rosenkavalier, Royal Opera (2009). Uneven revival of John Schlesinger’s 25-year-old production Capriccio, Grange Park Opera (2010).

280,"Pelléas et Mélisande, English Touring Opera",Pelléas et Mélisande,English Touring Opera,2015-10-02,alexandra Coghlan,"Shorn of several scenes, characters, and a large portion of the orchestra, the question was always whether English Touring Opera’s Pelléas et Mélisande was going to thrive in its new intimacy and intensity or shatter with the pressure. The answer sits somewhere between the two, in a production where some orchestral deficiencies are supplemented by a strong cast and bleeding cuts are – at least partially – staunched by an elegant, understated production.The deep jewel tones of Oliver Townsend’s sets give the Kingdom of Allemonde a soft-focus, underwater gloom. Everything in this unchanging landscape is caught in stasis, suspended between worlds. Though I question the wisdom of setting one of the most insistently outdoor of operas in an abstract interior (an overturned filing cabinet serves as well and cliff), this gently Pre-Raphaelite world of printed wallpapers, tumbling skeins of hair and knightly conflicts adds a framing narrative to Maeterlinck’s story: are these people playing at legends or truly living them?In a neat echo of Maeterlinck’s own original production, part of the stage is obscured behind thin mesh, blurring the action behind it, and rendering it, initially, with a clever trick of lighting, two-dimensional. The effect is of characters stepping from a painting – a sense not greatly shaken by the action that follows.Susanna Hurrell’s nervy, fragile Mélisande is all saucer-eyes and uncertainty – a timid creature barely civilised during her time at the castle. A fuller, more grounded voice than we often hear in the role lends an edge to this innocence, however, and both she and Conway court the ambiguity of her infidelity. Whether she is more sinned against or sinning remains tantalisingly unclear; when she protests the innocence of her love for Pelléas we believe her. The only sour note in Conway’s direction sees Mélisande kiss Michael Druiett’s king (at its best in the crooning delicacy of the final act) with unnecessary fervour, complicating one of the opera’s only straightforwardly tender relationships.The opposing points of the love triangle – Stephan Loges’s Golaud (pictured right) and Jonathan McGovern’s Pelléas – are both strong in their magnetic tug on Hurrell’s Mélisande. McGovern's boyish appearance is matched by an immensely attractive, tenorial baritone that opens up at its top end with unexpected warmth. His dynamic with the older, more rooted Loges – sternly beautiful in his anger – is natural and unforced, only equalled for charge by the interactions between Loges and Lauren Zolezzi’s Yniold – chamingly unaffected and sweetly sung. Only Helen Johnson’s Geneviève jars, with some linguistic awkwardnesses.Annelies Van Parys’s arrangement takes Debussy’s score down to just 14 parts. Texturally it’s a miracle of allusive flexibility, if anything intensifying the work’s French accent with its deft reworkings and instrumental groupings. Its thinner textures do, however, demand truly soloistic chamber playing, something lacking here on opening night. Conductor Jonathan Berman failed to generate the necessary flexibility to carry his band across Debussy’s tricky transitional thresholds, and this, coupled with some tuning and ensemble issues, led to some bulges spoiling the score’s fluid lines.ETO have taken a risk here, but it’s one whose pay-off will only increase as the run continues and the music settles.

The Duke of York's Theatre is one of the West End’s smaller mainstream venues, its proscenium arch is appropriate to the early 18th century operatic world in which castrato Farinelli made a fortune enchanting his audiences, and the recreation of the Southwark gem onstage with its ranks of candles in chandeliers as well as footlights and its pretty boxes has been perfectly achieved by Jonathan Fensom for the transfer of John Dove’s production. Yet I’d rather have been up there with the lucky audience members who got ringside seats on the action rather than some way back in the stalls, where the delivery came across as mostly piano to mezzo forte.History needs to be streamlined and shaped for drama, but I’m not sure that Claire van Kampen’s liberties always hit the mark. We’re supposed to believe that the greatest singer of his age turned the mind of Philip(pe) V of Spain, grandson of Louis XIV, from melancholy to action in a minute. But even graced by the most beautiful countertenor voice of our age with fine musical intelligence to match,  Iestyn Davies – fellow falsettists Rupert Enticknap and Owen Willetts sing on other nights – supported by a top group of musicians, I wasn’t convinced that a sliver of Porpora’s “Alto Giove”, a striking number in a pleasant sea of mostly Handel, would have done the trick. Much has been made of the play's pivotal point, but it's hardly new: the Pericles of a putative Shakespeare is more movingly transfigured by the music of the spheres.In any case, the proposition of music’s healing powers here is a bit glib. It doesn’t always work for depression, and we know that Philippe could only have found it a distraction, not a cure, because quite apart from maintaining the depressive’s habit of staying up all night, forcing his house-singer to keep him company, and sleeping all day, he soon started howling in dismal imitation. A line here does admit that one voice only temporarily stifles many. But there could have been a more complex probing of music’s elusive role in singing truth to power instead of the oldest trick of opera librettos in the book to pad out a plot which has nowhere to go – introduce a love triangle. I didn’t believe in Farinelli’s passion for Philippe’s beautiful consort, Isabella, for a minute. Perhaps that was because the rather weedy delivery of Sam Crane as speaking-Farinelli - there are two, partly to back up the separation between man and artist - didn’t kindle sufficient interest.The supporting cast is good at best (Melody Grove’s wise Isabella, Colin Hurley’s testy librettist Metastasio and Edward Peel’s music-resistant courtier De la Cuadra). We’ve all really come, though, to see the most spellbinding actor of our stage, Mark Rylance (pictured above with Grove), as the bipolar king. He effortlessly throws his book of engagement, his seemingly improvised hesitations and his charm at us from the start, making us believe he’s sane while all around are mad, at least until violence briefly erupts. There are some nice lines about the parallel, unsought-for kingdoms of the ruler and the singer, near-poetry about the music of the spheres and a few laugh-out-loud moments (Farinelli’s composer brother Riccardo, who supposedly gave his sibling the snip at the age of 10, becomes “Rick the Knife”). But the richly-worded world of Johnny “Rooster” Byron or Richard III it isn’t.There’s a nice quiet coda where Rylance doubles up as a tailor and Davies pierces the soul at length with “Lascia ch’io pianga” (the heroine’s hit from Rinaldo, which like most of the other Handel numbers it’s unlikely Farinelli would have sung). And the second act overcomes the limitations of the present venue by extending the action into the stalls. But I doubt if the material will really carve a place in your soul.   ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/farinelli-and-king-duke-yorks-theatre,3
282,"Il ritorno d' Ulisse in patria, AAM, Egarr, Barbican",Il ritorno d' Ulisse in patria,AAM,2015-09-30,alexandra Coghlan,"And so the Academy of Ancient Music’s triptych of Monteverdi operas at the Barbican comes to an end, three years after it began with Orfeo. If 2014’s Poppea was the cycle’s sexually-charged climax, then this Ulisse is the dark, contemplative coda – a sobering moment of morality after the victorious excesses of opera’s most venal couple.Il ritorno d’Ulisse is always a harder sell than Poppea. Virtue, chastity and constancy don’t make for quite such an obvious drama, and the opera’s structural oddities – a complicatedly large cast, an awkward final act – make it tricky to pull off. Benedict Andrews’s 2011 production for ENO, however, was a miracle of psychological horror, a memory still hot behind the eyes.Without the Young Vic’s technical toolbox to play with, directors Alexander Oliver and Timothy Nelson opted for a clear and unfussy staging, making the most of the Barbican Hall’s wide sightlines, balconies and aisles by bringing the action out into the audience. Monteverdi fills the gaps where sex and murders fit elsewhere with dramatic visual effects – Minerva’s flying chariot, Neptune turning the sailors to stone. Ingenious lighting solutions supplemented any lack of spectacle, focusing us more closely on the inner dramas of these minutely drawn characters.Ian Bostridge’s Ulisse (Bostridge, above right) may not quite be Homer’s wily wanderer, but there’s a rangy urgency about both his physicality and vocal delivery that brings real menace to the king-in-disguise. Deploying everything from a bladed snarl to mezza voce croon, his hero is war-broken and complicated, but redeemed in Monteverdi’s exquisite final duet – a flowering of melody after unyielding recitative. If Barbara Kozelj’s Penelope wasn’t quite his match, it was a quiet disparity. Slightly underprojected, the role seemed to sit awkwardly for her and quite a lot of silent vocal mechanics were audible. Her charged stillness, however, offered an essential centre around which the opera’s complex action swirled.Elizabeth Watts (pictured left) romped and cackled her way through the evening as Minerva, dispatching the Goddess’s rage-coloratura with unarguable polish. In Charmian Bedford’s Giunone she had some serious rivalry, though; Bedford’s late-entry cameo commanded and demanded attention, all gloss and athleticism. Elsewhere there was an unusually touching Eumete from Christopher Gillett as well as some predictably beautiful singing from Andrew Tortise as Ulisse’s son Telemaco. Sophie Junker was a delicate Melanto, paired with a slightly stiff Gwilyn Bowen as Eurimaco, and Lukas Jakobski delighted in a thunderous Neptune, reeling it back later as lover Antinoo.Directing from the harpsichord, Richard Egarr kept the pace measured but always energised, encouraging a wonderfully free-form reading of the score (such as it is), which always placed expressive impact and emotional authenticity over absolute fidelity.Monteverdi’s late-in-life opera is a psychological study in grief, love and survival. It has its quirks, but the music alone is so flexible, so contemporary as to give hope that it may yet see a busier life in the opera house. Till then, however, semi-stagings like this one are a very satisfying substitute – an appropriate homage both to Monteverdi himself and also to critic and writer Andrew Porter, to whose memory this performance was dedicated.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/il-ritorno-d-ulisse-patria-aam-egarr-barbican,4
283,"Orlando, Welsh National Opera",Orlando,Welsh National Opera,2015-09-28,stephen Walsh,"It’s almost impossible to imagine what a Handel opera performance can have been like in London in the 1730s, when Orlando first appeared. The audience came primarily to hear their favourite singers: and these must have been sensational, if not unduly dedicated to the dramatic verities they were supposed to be representing: castrati like Senesino and Farinelli, sopranos like Cuzzoni and Faustina (who once came to blows onstage, presumably trying to upstage one another). Nobody cared much about plot or character, but they loved the magical effects: Zoroastro whisking Orlando away in a flying chariot, or summoning an eagle with a golden bowl to cure his madness.None of this sort of thing cuts much ice today, partly for the sour-grapes reason that we mostly haven’t the singers and can’t afford the effects. WNO’s new production, by Harry Fehr, is nicely sung, smartly played, and on the whole competently directed. But it would hardly have interrupted the chitter-chat and card games in the King’s Theatre boxes in 1733.Fehr’s worthy attempt, with designer Yannis Thavoris, to make something serious out of this farrago of crazed passion cured by benign sorcery – by setting it in a psychiatric hospital, with Orlando as patient-in-chief and Zoroastro as a kind of cross between Mesmer and Oliver Sacks – merely draws attention to the basic vacuity of the scenario. Maybe with great singers strutting the stage, with lights flashing and characters vanishing in puffs of smoke, Orlando might make good pantomime. As music drama it’s dull at bestAs usual with Handel, though, the music itself is another matter. Surely there was never a composer who could turn out such an endless stream of unforgettable musical vignettes in so short a space of time and with barely any lapse from the highest level of invention and workmanship. Yet even by his standards, Orlando is exceptional. I would single out the heroine Angelica’s beautiful aria “Verdi piante,” and her last act duet with Orlando, which has some flavour of a Bach dialogue chorus. But really the quality is nonstop. And Handel was a music-dramatist in the sense that his aria motifs catch the emotional moment, even if they lead nowhere dramaturgically.In Cardiff, the singers labour with Fehr’s concept, including his indistinct (and puzzling) back-projections of Edward VIII and Mrs Simpson. But they are up for their Handel, relishing its melodic and arabesque brilliance, even if not quite finding the circus virtuosity that enthused Handel’s own audiences. The sopranos are best, without, thankfully, bashing each other. Rebecca Evans (pictured right) is an admirably poised Angelica, elegant and stylish, and suddenly very moving in “Verdi piante”; Fflur Wyn is delightful as poor Dorinda, originally a forlorn shepherdess, reduced by Fehr to nursing lunatics – fair comment, I suppose, on the NHS today. Both sopranos are technically superb, lacking only that last degree of bravado that brings audiences to the edge of their seats.The men are more problematic, simply because, through no fault of their own, they have the wrong voices. Modern altos, however talented, can’t do Senesino. Lawrence Zazzo is, nevertheless, pretty good as Orlando, projecting well into this big theatre and going mad tastefully if not quite frighteningly. Robin Blaze manages adequately the rather flat part of Medoro, whose main role is to walk in and out of swing doors, telling Angelica he loves her and Dorinda he doesn’t. But Daniel Grice is miscast as Zoroastro, a true bass part sung here by a baritone. The loss of authority is damaging but perhaps not disastrous, since the production undermines him in any case.The orchestra is WNO’s, reduced but with added theorbos and harpsichord, conducted, though, from the rostrum by Rinaldo Alessandrini. Sadly no violette marine, whatever they might be, in Orlando’s sleep aria, but plain violas, played senza vibrato. Good that the company don’t bus in a baroque orchestra for Handel, but simply turn their hands to it as to any other repertory opera. Whether Orlando could ever be repertory in that sense I’m not sure, but not, probably, until directors accept it for what it is.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/orlando-welsh-national-opera,3
284,"Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, English National Opera",Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk,English National Opera,2015-09-27,David Nice,"“The music quacks, hoots, pants and gasps”: whichever of his Pravda scribes Stalin commandeered to demolish Shostakovich’s “tragedy-satire” in January 1936, two years into its wildly successful stage history, didn’t mean that as a compliment, but it defines one extreme of the ENO Orchestra’s stupendous playing under its new Music Director Mark Wigglesworth. On the other hand there are also heartbreaking tenderness, terrifying whispers and aching sensuousness. A fuller picture of Shostakovich’s murdering heroine as 20th - or even 21st - century Russian woman couldn’t be imagined; soprano Patricia Racette and director/designer Dmitri Tcherniakov help to focus the mind no less unsparingly on what she represents.Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk was a masterly choice to usher in the new era of a company which conductor Edward Gardner has left in peerless artistic shape (he returns to conduct Tristan and Isolde next summer). Wigglesworth made a stunning impact in a 2001 ENO revival of David Pountney’s flagship production with its red policemen and frantic activity. Tcherniakov’s, first seen in Dusseldorf seven years ago but apparently rethought “as new”, couldn’t be more different: where Pountney’s vision was often caricatural and busy to the point of overload, this Lady Macbeth is outwardly poised, though not static, and stylized when violence erupts, ruthlessly symmetrical in a way that only our own Richard Jones can achieve, and unpredictable so that the last act comes as a real shock (probably it’s as well that no production images were available of this scene).Tcherniakov’s Katerina Izmailova, the merchant’s wife who murders for passion but also reacts to oppression and brutality, is no feminist icon. The way she’s made to kneel at her husband’s feet in a replay of the scene in Ostrovsky’s The Storm - set to music by Janáček as Katya Kabanova, a very different role Racette has already played at ENO to perfection – gets mirrored for real in her abasement before the dominant presence of John Daszak’s compelling worker Sergei: the Magdalen who washes her wounded lover after his flogging to the music of Shostakovich’s shattering Passacaglia – never more intense than here, a great fusion between sound and vision – becomes a slave to love, a mare mounted by her stallion (as one of the libretto's many animal images puts it).Racette (pictured above right) is compelling from the start, motionless in a box room of orange oriental carpets while factory life goes on around her, crumpling and seething in passion – but still with very measured physical movements – and ending up rocking in a filthy prison cell, the very image of extreme torment (the steppes on the way to Siberia are suggested only by an encompassing black through which Matthew Best’s Old Convict and the chorus project). The bright voice can spread under pressure, but whose wouldn’t in Shostakovich’s insanely taxing and harsh vocal writing? I also wonder, incidentally, if the original Russian text fits as awkwardly as David Pountney's English version, created from a rough translation; maybe it was time for a new one.This Katerina keeps her dignity and delivers her proto-feminist manifesto to the depraved workers with superb aplomb; the passion, which comes quickly when it comes, is charted through careful illustration of Shostakovich’s magnificently various interludes. The denouement is as haunting to perfection as was that of Katarina Dalayman’s Katerina in Richard Jones’s equally unconventional Royal Opera production (pictured below: Racette and Daszak in the final scene). There’s a shocking attempted suicide, and a double murder which is very far from what Shostakovich imagined, but of unparalleled bleakness and horror.The men, of course, are all shits. While we want more of the splendid Peter Hoare’s caricatural husband - Shostakovich gives him little music to sing - Robert Hayward needs a bit more bass heart-of-darkness as disgusting father-in law Boris Izmailov. Daszak’s clarion Sergey makes us hate him at the end even more than usual, though the disgust is motivated by the fact that when the Chief of Police (a true bass, Per Bach Nissen) comes to arrest the murderers at their wedding, his preparation to offer a massive bribe is forestalled by Katerina’s confession. There are spot-on characterisations of debased women by Rosie Aldridge (pictured below on the left with Racette and Hoare) as a worker who’s come to expect her abuse and Clare Presland, with tones reminiscent of Sally Burgess who also, if memory serves, played the role of the convict Sonyetka. The chorus is, as throughout last season, tirelessly impressive.There’s nothing in Tcherniakov’s distressing drama or Gleb Filshtinsky’s choreographic lighting which doesn’t match Wigglesworth’s vision. And a conductor could go no further in eliciting from his players six pianos or five fortes, a noise so loud it set me on the brink of tears with sheer terror. Solos, from first violin down to contrabassoon, manage to sound unlike the instruments in question, which is a compliment. The extra brass in the boxes, one slight out-of-synch on the first night apart, are resplendently awful.In his quest for extreme symphonic illumination and depth, Wigglesworth may set himself and the singers challenges of co-ordination – a lighter-sprung style would be easier for those on stage to follow – but correspondences between stage and pit should sharpen up as the run progresses. Compassion is almost drowned out by disgust – there must have been a serious sado-masochistic streak in Shostakovich – yet ultimately triumphs. It’s not a comfortable evening at any point, but this is exactly what great music-theatre should be doing.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/lady-macbeth-mtsensk-english-national-opera,5
285,"Lost In Thought: A Mindfulness Opera, Mahogany Opera Group, LSO St Luke's",Lost In Thought: A Mindfulness Opera,Mahogany Opera Group,2015-09-26,alexandra Coghlan,"Was it when we all obediently received, then held, contemplated, then savoured, then (and only then) swallowed a single grape? Or was it as we paced solemnly round the room for the sixth time, whirling brightly coloured plastic tubing above our heads to make a whirring sound, that the penny dropped? Actually I’m fairly certain it was being exhorted, for the nth time, to “embody alertness”, to feel my “super-alert hands” that did it for me. Don’t be fooled by the marketing: Rolf Hind’s Lost in Thought is no more an opera than I am a yogi.You can talk about meaningful silences or the Japanese concept of “Ma” all you like (though you’ll sound like a frightful pseud); you can argue a case for reframing expectations, for subverting traditions, for disconcerting a jaded audience. Ultimately, though, when you designate something as an opera you establish that genre as a relevant and useful point of reference, something it simply isn’t in this case. Come to Lost in Thought as a gentle – occasionally rather charming – meditation, an exercise in communal activity, or come just for four hours of peace. Don’t come for the music, because there isn’t much.Billing the work – a co-production between the Barbican and the Mahogany Opera Group – as “the world’s first mindfulness opera” is also misleading, if not downright untrue. What is Philip Glass’s Einstein on the Beach if not precisely that? A sustained meditation on space and time, drawing the mind away from the everyday with obsessive, incremental movements and hypnotic musical repetition. And what of John Luther Adams’s sound installations? Not strictly opera, but works like Inuksuit, in which an outdoor audience walk freely through and around the musicians as waves of sound pass from one side to another, contemplating the collision of music and natural sound, also come pretty close to pure musical mindfulness.Yes, at one level Lost In Thought is the ultimate sound-of-one-hand-clapping opera – the logical conclusion of a concept. If you strip sensation back to that of our own bodies and immediate environs, music to our own sounds and silences, then naturally the effect is intensifying. But is it more intense than a really good performance of Parsifal or Peter Grimes? No.I’d go further than that; the setup of a conventional opera house, with its darkened auditorium and proscenium arch, its rows of seats and expectation of stillness and silence, comes far closer to pure meditation that any amount of mindful stretching, daal-eating and grape-contemplating. Concentrating on a continuously unfolding score, language, sets and singing occupies an entire mind, leaving little space for those distracting thoughts mezzo and mindfulness leader Lore Lixenberg kept urging us to welcome, then release.Hind’s score, what there is of it, consists of a series of attractive musical episodes for eight-piece ensemble. Shapes, textures and moods are paramount, taking it in turns to dominate each sequence of repetition. Instrumental colours are layered gradually up and down, carrying the listeners from sleep to waking or activity to calm, as needed. Rhythmic complexity keeps the ear alert, distancing this music from the Max Richter score an audience at the Wellcome Collection will be sleeping to tomorrow night. Lixenberg is quietly commanding, ensuring her mindful beginners never stray too far from the business of stillness. Yet still it doesn’t quite add up to an opera.I’m not convinced by Lost in Thought. I do, however, have to acknowledge a debt to Rolf Hind and his show. It took a trip to a “mindfulness opera” to make me realise that I’ve actually been mindful all along. And, like Moliere’s prose-speaking Bourgeois Gentilhomme, I couldn’t be more delighted with the discovery.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/lost-thought-mindfulness-opera-mahogany-opera-group-lso-st-lukes,2
286,theartsdesk Q&A: Conductor Mark Wigglesworth,theartsdesk Q&A: Conductor Mark Wigglesworth,,2015-09-23,David Nice,"Mark Wigglesworth and I go back quite a long way in terms of meetings – namely to 1996, when I interviewed him for Gramophone about the launch of his Shostakovich symphonies cycle on BIS. He completed it a decade later, though that release hung fire until last year. We should have discussed the whole project shortly afterwards, but despite his generously coming to talk to the students in what was then my Opera in Focus class about Parsifal, which we were studying, I wasn’t able to keep my part of the bargain.Now, then, is just the right time. Having literally stunned us with his deep, dark conducting of Shostakovich’s Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk at ENO in 2001, Wiggesworth is back with the same opera to mark his inauguration as the company’s Music Director – just about the only candidate who I guarantee won’t disappoint after the amazing success of Edward Gardner’s tenure (Wigglesworth was also one of the options at the time that Gardner took the job). His track record with ENO is one of pure success: the most meaningful Cosi fan tutte I’ve ever seen on stage, in Matthew Warchus’s production with Susan Gritton, Mary Plazas, Janis Kelly (pictured below) and Toby Spence in the cast (though a Barbican staging wasn’t as successful) – followed by a Parsifal which converted theartsdesk’s vehemently anti-Wagnerian Igor Toronyi-Lalic, and a total fusion of drama and music in Janáček'’s Katya Kabanova so powerful I went twice.To prepare, I made sure I listened to each one of the symphonies recordings I’d not caught up on, and found all of them held their truthfully recorded and incisively interpreted ground alongside the most successful of the recent cycles, Vasily Petrenko’s with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra (Wigglesworth's own notes to each instalment are full of startling new insights). So that’s where we started, before moving on to the opera and ending up with issues of “accessibility” and selling tickets at ENO, challenges facing the company as it moves, reeling from the blow of the Arts Council’s capricious cut but artistically never in better shape, into its new era.DAVID NICE: You started your cycle of Shostakovich symphonies when we first met, with the Seventh [""Leningrad""], in 1996 and the final release, of the First and Fifteenth, appeared last year. Do you wish you could go back and do anything differently?MARK WIGGLESWORTH: When I first did them, the confidence you feel you need to create a performance comes from a conviction that this is how it has to be, and I’ve done some of these pieces 50, 60 times. And that’s performing, not counting the rehearsals. When you do them over and over again with different orchestras, different oboists and even different leaders of the orchestra, you realize that it’s fine – not to be completely different, but another way works too. And you’re still being true to your vision of what this music is saying.Your mind is flexible enough to embrace the change.That’s right, it’s like a satnav which has a goal that it’s heading to, and you decide to take a slightly different route, and it recalculates and either says, that’s fine, if you want to go this way we will, or else it says turn round where possible. And if you know when to trust and when to lead, that’s the secret. You never get it really right, but that philosophical conflict is quite clear to me, that it’s when to let go and when to demand both musically and psychologically.It’s interesting that finally very recently listening to them all together…Did you notice a big difference [between the recordings with the BBC National Orchestra of Wales – Wigglesworth pictured left by Ross Cohen at the start – and the later ones with the Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra]?I didn’t, no, that’s what surprised me, I’ve said to you before that what amazed me is this depth of sound that you always get anyway, but between the Wales and the Netherlands performances – they’re both orchestras that one doesn’t think of, perhaps unfairly, as in the front league, and yet they sound it, and bears out why I think that it’s daft to put up a list of the world’s best orchestras, it should be about the world’s best partnerships. [MW laughs]. But they sound remarkably similar to me, I don’t know what you think.Well, to be honest, I haven’t listened, of course I listen to the edits and I’m very much part of the process, but I don’t think I’ve listened to any of them since they’ve been released, and that’s why I’m curious to know, not specifically about the Welsh being different from the Dutch, but me being different; and the Shostakovich symphonies, though they are so different as individual pieces, there’s always a unified voice coming through them, and I’d be curious to know whether that voice had changed.What seemed incredibly consistent was the sense of space, without being slow, the articulation, which is so clear and all dynamics working, and also of course, this is partly the BIS recording, but when it’s ppp it’s some of the quietest sound I’ve heard on CD.And people accused us of manipulating, we haven’t. It’s interesting what the whole CD listening experience: is it, as I’m sure you do, sitting down and listening, getting a volume that can cope and making an active decision to listen, or is it chucked in the car when you’re driving around the M25, in which case you’re going to have a problem? BIS’s philosophy, which I’m proud to be part of, is that we make records for people who really want to sit down and listen to them, and that’s maybe taxing for your neighbours on the one hand and your ears on the other. They don’t compress and we work really hard to play as quietly as we can.They used to have caveat on the front about the dynamic range. I’ve just heard, and was moved to tears by the dynamic range of the Netherlands Radio Choir on the Thirteenth [""Babi Yar""] Symphony – also their Russian seemed so clear. And their crescendos and decrescendos are so impressive.I think the Thirteenth and the Fourteenth are the two for me that I never want to stop doing, and I think it’s the texts that give you the confidence of what the music’s actually about, because although you have a sense of what the others are about, you can’t argue with the texts.It always amazes me that Prokofiev never lived to that time when he could say exactly what he meant, but Shostakovich did, with Yevtushenko’s poetry – it’s very specific and clear and almost hard, and that “Fears“ movement, there you have the document of what was felt in the 1930s and 40s.Terrifying, absolutely terrifying.This interests me – when you started you were very Testimony-based [on the book which purports to be Shostakovich’s memoirs “as related to and edited by"" Solomon Volkov]: we know that there’s been controversy since then about how authentic it is. I think that fundamentally there’s great truth in there, only doubt about by which route it came, but it’s still a useful guide.I think it’s a bit of a red herring, Testimony, in that people talk about the legality about it. I mean, OK, but as far as I’m concerned if Ashkenazy, Rostropovich, Kurt Sanderling, Victor Liebermann believe the essence of it, then that’s good enough for me. It’s not a question of whether literally he’s writing. The point that matters is, is this what the music is expressing? And if you listen to the music, it is. I remember reading it for the first time and devouring it. And in my notes I’ve always tried to be semantically careful, trying to not create an obstacle to the view. It seems to me in the music, and I would like to think that I didn’t need to read Testimony to hear that.Sure, it just confirmed what you felt.And I like to think that people can hear the music without any knowledge of it, and what’s interesting about Shostakovich’s life as a composer, he’s probably the only composer whose context does add to your experience. But I would still like to think that he is a great enough composer that that experience can speak to people subliminally. And I agree that it can be taken too far when it’s said, ""Oh if it’s a two-note figure which represents…"" But when I do the Tenth Symphony, you’re not thinking Stalin, you’re thinking evil and brutality and anger, and you’d think that whether it was Stalin or not. But as an historical document, these symphonies are equally fascinating.They’ve often been described as a developing chronicle of Soviet history…Although what’s depressing, and equally fascinating, is that if you listened to the 15 symphonies not knowing their numbers, what order would you put them in? And I don’t think you would put them in the order in which they were written. I did that as an experiment. You’d put One first, do you know what I mean? Is Six a development...And Four could belong to when it was actually first performed, in the 1960s, 30 years after it had been composed...Exactly. And you’d probably put 11 and 12 probably earlier than 8; 9 you’d certainly put earlier. So a logical development emotionally doesn’t work, and I think why I find it depressing is that the Soviet Union was just repetition, the ability of history to repeat itself across decades, centuries..And you look at “A Career” in the Thirteenth Symphony, and I think of a certain Russian conductor operating today, someone who’s signed the Faustian pact with Putin to keep and build on what he has, and this is a great interpreter of Shostakovich.  Well, I’ve written an article for The Independent which will probably come out before your interview, full disclosure, I don’t want you to think that you’re duplicating, but – they said, would you just write something about Shostakovich, and I didn’t know where it was going to take me, actually; I didn’t want to write the obvious about the Pravda article denouncing Lady Macbeth [in 1936, nearly two years after it had opened, as “chaos instead of music”, which marked the crackdown on freedom of expression in the arts], it’s fascinating and it needs to be said…That’s the one thing everyone knows about Shostakovich.Exactly. And when I started thinking about the feminist angle of this piece, and Shostakovich’s desire to write a kind of Ring for women, a tetralogy about Russian women, I’d forgotten about that…I always wondered about it, whether he said that just for the public record...Where I am at the moment, I think it’s massive, and this piece as a feminist tract – the relevance of it today is extraordinary and terrifying, and I started doing some research on feminism in Russia – it was unbelievable.You mean now?Now, and since Stalin. And the extraordinary thing is that immediately after the Revolution, it was an optimistic time for women. It was when Stalin arrived that this need for machismo style of politics increased, and now we have the sexualisation of Putin now – and when you’re talking about now, look at Pussy Riot – their crime was feminism. To discover the relevance of this piece today was both good and bad. So I think – there are the women “In the Store” in the Thirteenth Symphony. I don’t think he was a feminist in the political sense……and his wives were there to look after him.But I think he saw himself as the voice for any oppressed individual or group, whether it was Jews or women or the Hungarians in 1956, whoever the oppressed people of the time were. And I think women are a part of that group of people for him. I certainly didn’t think that before.Next page: on Shostakovich's Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk and Tcherniakov's production Does anything that [the director of the ENO production of Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk Dmitri] Tcherniakov’s done  affect that? Because I didn’t see this production when it was done in Germany, the images are wonderful…As you know the Pountney production was iconic and I’m relieved and thrilled to say that this could not be more different in a way that I believe is equally valid. Shostakovich said the piece was a tragedy-satire, and Dostoyevsky said that tragedy and satire were the twin sisters of truth, so maybe I’m being a bit simplistic, but Pountney’s production was very strong on the satire. And it was brilliant, I loved it, while this is on the tragedy, and there is not a single gesture in it that doesn’t come from the music (pictured above: Patricia Racette as Katerina in the ENO production, photo by Clive Barda). That’s unusual. He does hear it in a way that’s incredibly sincere, he knows these women – and the men.Has he been here working on it?Every day. It feels brand new, to be honest. The Dusseldorf production was a long time ago and obviously the set arrives and it is what it is and you work with that set, which is not without its challenges in a different auditorium, but in the work with the singers we’ve all felt it’s a new production. That’s as it should be.I didn’t realize that Patricia Racette was singing Katerina until recently, and of course you did Janáček'’s Katya Kabanova with her, pictured right, which contains a similar situation – the downtrodden daughter-in-law has to make obeisance to her husband’s powerful parent.It’s very similar, the Leskov story [The Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District] is intriguing to read because there is no moral judgment.And her most appalling crime in it, the murder of a nephew, is cut out of the opera.Exactly, well, it always helps to make people more sympathetic if you get rid of the child murder. I think it’s interesting that in order to make her sympathetic, Shostakovich thought, I can’t write music that will defend a child-murderer, I can write music that can defend all the other murders, and he does. But when you read Leskov there is no emotional value put to her action, so your judgment towards her is different, in that you’re not manipulated. Shostakovich is very manipulative, he makes it incredibly difficult for you not to feel sorry for her, not only by making all the men real shits, extremely so, but he gives her these tunes, this music, and the power of music to overcome your moral compass: I mean if you do feel sorry for her, really? You’re not condoning murder, but when you hear those harmonies and the gut-wrenching loneliness of her solos, you have to be on her side, and I think that’s the power of music that Stalin was terrified of. It’s not so the satire and the sex scenes or the send-up of the chief of police, it’s not the difficulty of the music, because it’s popular and incredibly accessible, it’s not modernist in the Wozzeck sense…Or even The Nose [Shostakovich’s first full-length opera of 1929].Exactly. So what Stalin feared – we know he was a musician in that bizarre way that Hitler was as well – it’s such a strange thing for us all to deal with, that monsters can be touched by music, but I think Stalin saw the power of that and he was terrified.We’ll never know how he responded emotionally, will we? Because the stereotype is to think that all the bureaucrats were idiots and they didn’t hear between the lines, but many of them did.I think he did, and that begs the question: Why did Shostakovich survive? Hardly any of his friends did. Why did Stalin spare him – really, was he that famous? He wouldn’t have been that famous if he’d dealt with him in 1936. So it is a fascinating thing – and Testimony talks about Stalin dying to a Mozart piano concerto going round and round, and the story of the recording of that concerto was Stalin hearing a lady playing on the radio and saying, I want that record, and the staff realising it was a concert, and overnight they made a single pressing, they rang her up – so this is all Testimony, so who knows? As I say, I think you can get bogged down in it, but I think that Stalin’s understanding of music was probably valid.We know much less about that than Hitler’s very precise views on Wagner and Bruckner…Much to those composers’ loss, of course.In the same way that people bang on about Wagner and Hitler, they bang on about the Lady Macbeth scandal. What I find interesting about that Pravda article is that it’s actually quite correct, about screaming and neurosis. Yes, and there were plenty of American critics who said the same thing.“Pornophony”.Right.Can you remember details about the 2001 Lady Macbeth at ENO? I remember Vivien Tierney very vividly [pictured right], and one moment crystallized it all for me, that moment on the death of the father-in-law when the brass band on stage just blasted out and I nearly fell off my seat. What’s changed in the way you hear the music now?I think it’s related to what we were saying at the beginning. The brass band are not on stage in this, they’re in the boxes, so they’re powerful, but there’s a disconnect between what you see and what you hear in this production as opposed to the Pountney one. What’s interesting about this production is it’s so intimate. It’s very much close-up.That’s difficult to achieve in the Coliseum, but not impossible.Yes. But when you’re looking at this one face and you hear that music, not specifically that moment, it changes how you do it. Because it is in her head, and the audience aren’t really watching much, and so it’s a subconscious thing that I hadn’t really thought about until you asked. But I would like to think that it is equally powerful. Right now I think it’s more powerful, but we’re not in a sort of competition. It’s terrifying to think of that power, 15 brass players in addition to the ones in the pit, in your head, you think, goodness, Shostakovich heard that in his head.That’s not a fashionable view, the internalizing. I remember when the Borodin Quartet played the 15 quartets in Norwich, I was challenged when I placed Britten on the level of Shostakovich for the inner tensions, and someone in the audience challenged that. And I said, not only that, but the fact that Britten and Shostakovich had such similar angsts, yet they lived under different systems. Of course for Britten there was another sort of oppression... Exactly. I think their connection was because they both felt trapped, they both felt imprisoned, and they are kindred spirits, unquestionably.That later meeting when they picked up from each other I find very moving. One of the things that struck me was that when I first did this opera I’d only done, probably, five of the symphonies, and now I’ve done them all, and coming back to Lady Macbeth what fascinates me is that he saw his whole life at the age of 24 – he knew what it was going to be like. And he wrote it before the Pravda attack. He was celebrated, he was incredibly popular and sparky. And yet you could imagine this piece being autobiographical, identity with the suffering individual, and the satire and the wit and the power, everything in the symphonies is in there. Of course in his later works he quoted from Lady Macbeth, so there is a false mirror effect going on, but it doesn’t feel like a young man’s piece. Occasionally on a musical level it does, but not on an emotional level. And what’s interesting about the musical thing is there are actually three versions – ’32, the ’35 score which is a piano score with some modifications, also pre-Pravda, and then the Katerina Izmailova of the 1960s. I’ve looked at all of those and I’m informed about all of them in my choices. You’ve not conducted Katerina Izmailova as well?No. But what’s interesting about the anti-Testimony people, and there’s an interesting article in The Shostakovich Companion by Rosamund Bartlett, and it’s quite supportive of Katerina, on the basis that Shostakovich said towards the end of his life, “This is the only version that should be played”. Now of course we, the Testimony-ites, would say, Well he would say that anyway. But what’s interesting for a musician is that although the later version cuts out the rawness of the drama and the violence, the corrections he made I believe have to be valid. And all the metronome marks are slightly different, and it’s not that all of it is a lot slower, a lot is a little bit slower, and I’ve tried to find the balance in the choices I’ve made, which are quite self-conscious changes, between maintaining that raw, unbelievable energy of a 24-year-old, all of that nerve-wracking stuff with a composer of the experience of another 35 years.So you wouldn’t take on any of the new music?I haven’t changed notes or cut bars or anything, but the tempos and dynamics mean that you do realise what he wanted to hear. Hopefully we’ll keep that shock and awe, but in the article the gist is, Why do we assume he was lying when he said, this third version is the one I want to perform? It’s an interesting question; we shouldn’t be held spellbound by our own tyranny of Testimony, I think it’s best to keep an open mind: that’s what I’m trying to do at the moment. We’re also doing Force of Destiny at the moment as you know, those versions are only seven years apart and the differences between those are unbelievable and fascinating.Which version are you going for?Musically we’re doing the later version. Whether that’s what you see on stage is another matter, and I’ve talked to Calixto [Bieito] about it, and theatrically the first version feels true.Where Don Alvaro hurls himself off the rock at the end?Yes, Calixto’s view is: Well, maybe he doesn’t have to do that, but really, is he going to walk off into the sunset? But just as a musician –  we’re changing the third act order, because we know Verdi was never happy with it. But how he changed in seven years – there’s not a single bar that’s not more interesting in the later version. So it’s interesting that Shostakovich didn’t change that much, and that’s what I meant about the symphonies – you could listen to the Fourth Symphony and it could be his last work.Next page: on Stalin, silence and the ENO experienceIt’s probably wrong to say he didn’t have the breadth, but when you listen to Britten, there’s a lot of joy in the earlier stuff, and with Shostakovich I don’t know that there’s ever joy as such.But that’s the Russian soul, isn’t it? I told this story a lot not to newspapers but to friends, because I find it extraordinary – when I did the “Leningrad” Symphony in Los Angeles, one of the violinists said to me that she was born during the Siege, and we were sharing the unbelievable horror stories of what people did to each other, then she looked at me square in the eyes and said: “Of course, it’s much worse now.” And this sort of suffering soul of the Russians which goes on… this was in the Nineties. But now, 25 per cent of Russians would vote for Stalin, Putin is celebrating…It’s almost more Stalinistic than Stalin in every way except the killing.We have to hope except the killing. Five million people were in the gulags before they admitted they existed, so we have to hope that Google Earth gives us a bit of help…People are still being removed. Actually to me, reading what Mussolini was up to in the 1930s, it’s more like that, but there are Stalinist aspects.If it hadn’t been for Shostakovich I wouldn’t have known anything about Stalin as a student. Because in the mid-Seventies at my school we had to write an essay on whether Stalin was a great man or not, and I remember my mother’s horror at me being asked to write this essay: what were the good points and what were the bad points? Her horror at what a 12-year-old boy was being asked to engage in.This is your mother not with a particular background, but just knowing…She knew. And I can’t remember how that particular history lesson ended, but in the 70s everyone was very proud of how they stood up to Hitler, and Stalin was slightly more complicated and embarrassing, so perhaps best not to talk about him that way in history lessons. In England we like to think we’re terribly truthful and honest and open, but that was my history lesson on Stalin. It was only through music – I remember studying the Tenth Symphony for A Level, and through that you get to the history, and then you begin to realize… And that’s why the music is so important. People say, why do you do so much Shostakovich? Essentially because I love the power it has to express both private and public emotions, it’s a real privilege to be part of that. But it’s so much more than that, and that’s why the historical context does matter.I don’t think it’s just because of the historical context that Shostakovich symphonies now fill a hall, it’s because of how it speaks. I reckon there are 11 of the 15 symphonies that would be in a concert programme and no-one would raise an eyebrow. Two and Three, 12 – apart from them the others are regularly performed. That’s more than any other symphonist ever – Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Mahler even. Why? As you say, it’s not just people coming for a history lesson. And the most popular classical music is popular for a reason, not because it’s populist but because it’s the greatest music, whether it’s Beethoven Five or Brahms Four, Meistersinger or La Boheme.And it requires the greatest concentration.We underestimate the public as performers at our peril.Newspapers underestimate the public all the time. I don’t know why this is, but the idea that at just about every Prom I went to there were 5,500 people [Mark Wigglesworth at the 2014 Proms by Chris Christodoulou] – at some very mixed programmes… We need to embrace that rather than give the impression that classical music is – the fact that classical music is a challenge is its greatest strength. Whether it’s cricket or religion or classical music, these major areas of our lives that are struggling to maintain their audience give up their essence at great risk, I think.I was reading a piece today which maintained that “classical” concerts are a conflict zone between people who are uptight or laid back. It was saying, people need to loosen up. It was saying there’s a division and there needs to be a unity, but actually there’s a great unity in silence, the intensity of the way people listen. And you can’t lose that in a Mahler or Shostakovich symphony, where the silence is a crucial part of the performance. .We’re all terrified of silence, aren’t we? And when I’ve done these Shostakovich pieces there are incredibly silent moments and there are audiences that can’t cope. They only get coughs at those moments because they can’t cope. They are hearing the silence, it’s there, and for many people it’s terriying. I used to think it was because they weren’t listening, and though I think that’s valid in certain cases, I think that for some people it’s frightening. And we fight that everywhere, in the idea that noise is better than silence, whether you’re in a hospital or a bookshop, it’s extraordinary. It’s extraordinary the idea that music needs to be louder to be better, to be more relaxing. We know that music raises your blood pressure. It cannot therefore be a relaxing motivator, and the Pipe Down campaign is absolutely vital, to maintain our right to the privacy of our mind.If it could be seen as active meditation, though I know that’s a different thing, no-one would think of using their mobile phone during meditation.No, although most places where you go and have a massage will have music on. And I have to use the line, well, it’s not for me because I’m a musician, which is not quite what I believe. And music inspires you. I think going back to the audiences thing, we should be incredibly proud of how special the experience is. That is not to say that we don’t want as many people as possible to experience that. But any company which diminished its product in order to get more sales would not last. And any company would say that the way to get more sales is to make your product even better. And that’s something which here at ENO is a very interesting discussion to have. Because Lilian Baylis, whom I talk about a lot as being fundamental to this company’s past, present and future, her view was not about accessibility as a goal, it was about the combination of accessibility and the highest quality of experience. So it’s not just that we want everybody to come to ENO, we want everybody to come and see how special opera is, the messaging of that, to use a 21st century term, is quite complex, but I’m really keen that we celebrate the fact that it’s a special occasion. It’s not about what you wear. People don’t ask when they go to the theatre what should they wear, but they are concerned when they go to the opera. Those are messages we can try to get across, that that’s a stereotype that is not relevant in this company. But the harder thing to make people realise is that special is special.You partly do that by the sheer power of performance. I think people will generally shut up and listen if something is gripping. Which is why I find the whole attitude from performers… It’s up to us to get people’s attention. The actors that famously walk to the front of the stage and tell people off for doing something unacceptable – of course we’re all frustrated when that sort of thing happens, but is it the right of the performer to tell people how to behave, other than how they are performing, forcing the concentration? Anybody can leave a phone on by accident, frankly. It’s not the greatest thing in the world. It’s far worse with someone who’s not engaged. And the engagement is our responsibility. And the reason I get upset with the coughing audiences – and I’m going to slightly contradict myself in what I said about the Shostakovich silences – is your consciousness that you failed that person’s experience, and that’s why it’s disappointing.People used to remark on minute’s silences at the end – I remember when Rattle did Britten’s War Requiem in Bury St Edmunds – but minutes’ silences now are really frequent. They happen a lot here in the UK. And that is a lot to do with the authority of the conductor, just as not having people applaud between the third and fourth movements of Tchaikovsky’s Pathetique is up to the conductor. I wrote in one of my blogs about how long is a piece? Because for a conductor, when does the music start? There’s this moment before the start which the conductor is unquestionably controlling. And that’s very easy to do, frankly. But what about the end of a piece? How long should that be and is it up to you to control it? Is it something that you can be part of. There’s one Beethoven symphony where there’s a pause marked on the silence, and I bet that’s never been heard.I’ve seen several performances of Chailly’s Mahler where there’s a very loud ending, and yet people don’t break in with applause.Because of how he’s done it. With Shostakovich Five, if there is immediate applause at the end, I think: I didn’t do that right, unquestionably. And the greatest thrill is to get to the end of Five or Ten and for that to happen. Then you know that people are spoken to, they get it. But as you say what’s interesting about the Proms and other concerts – not enough people go to London, but we are still lucky to live in a city where people are there because they want to be and therefore the experience is a very genuine and sincere two-way communication between the audience and the performers. I’ve been around a lot in the world, and – nowhere is as good as Tokyo, I would say. I was warned that it was about respect: it’s more than respect, it’s about engaging in experience.Whereas I remember I was taking part in a Prokofiev-Shostakovich event at Carnegie Hall and Ashkenazy was conducting the Thirteenth Symphony, with Yevtushenko reading before the music started, but the general feeling was a low level restlessness all the way through. There wasn’t anything spectacularly awful happening in the audience, but it was disconcerting..Apparently I have the record in [New York’s] Avery Fisher Hall for the number of people walking out, when I did Shostakovich’s Fourteenth with the New York Phil. I’m told that about 400 people left during it. I could tell there was a restlessness, but I didn’t really know until I got off stage and the two singers who’d been looking at them, [Yelena] Prokina and [Sergei] Leiferkus, were so furious that they said, if it happens again – there were four performances – if this happens in performance two, we’re going home. So I gave a speech to the audience before performance two, and I said, well, you’re about to hear 11 songs about death, and it’s going to take about an hour. And almost to a man, the entire audience looked at their watches. It was a fascinating thing to see that their dinner reservations, and all that they were going to do after the concert, were already on their mind. When does that mean I’m getting out, and should I go now, and do I really want to engage for an hour in death? The exit was considered an improvement that night, but why do you go to Shostakovich 14 in the first place, I’m all for curiosity…It’s part of the social diary, I guess, or you have a subscription… we don’t for the most part have subscriptions here…Which is both good and bad, one would die for the subscription because the security and the freedom that gives you is really special [Wigglesworth pictured right by Benjamin Ealovega]. But I was just talking to the box office manager here, whom I’ve known for years and years, and he was saying that across the arts more and more is last minute, so the box office finds it hard to know how things are going to be until then. Now although that is stressful, it’s actually thrilling, that people’s decision is, let’s go now, and it’s present tense existence, rather than, I bought my tickets for this six months ago and I didn’t realize Andy Murray was playing that afternoon…They invariably have standbys here, I know because a lot of my students would regularly go along at the last minute, but actually it did fill up. Even the Mastersingers did fill up – but how can you not sell out Wagner double-quick, especially when it was so ecstatically reviewed?You only need 16,000 people, I think there were seven performances, and we need to engage in that question. If you can do work as great as that, as well as they did it, we need to absolutely ask ourselves: what could we, should we have done, what is this about?Because even second-rate Wagner at Covent Garden sells, I think.There is a Wagner audience, yes, thank goodness.I was worried when there was that spell of three not good productions, and I’ve never seen the place so empty. That was the autumn of 2013.What – Fledermaus and Fidelio?And Magic Flute. Actually that sold well because it was Complicite, I hated it, sorry, but…I would like to talk to you about why you hated it, not now but later. Because I’m doing the revival. I respect your views and I’m interested to know what you hated about it.It’s such a good cast coming up. It was just for me very dark and serious throughout. Having seen that Parsifal at the Royal Opera in which Amfortas and the brotherhood were very sombre men in suits who went through this hideous ritual – I do think that whatever else is wrong in the world of Parsifal, that moment of ritual should have something enlightened about it. Similarly for me Sarastro and his brotherhood can’t just be creepy guys in suits. That’s interesting, it was very successful in Amsterdam. And we have got a thrilling cast. And I wanted to do it because I think that having an orchestra visible onstage feels appropriate for the music director to be part of it.No, I loved that.But maybe after one of our chats on your course we can talk in more detail about it, because I think a revival has to be an opportunity to build on what was done the first time. And I suspect that Simon [McBurney], from his own attitude to the work, feels the sense of repetition in his life. Let's see. ",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/theartsdesk-qa-conductor-mark-wigglesworth,
287,"Hofmann, Royal Danish Orchestra, Boder, Symphony Hall, Birmingham",Hofmann,Royal Danish Orchestra,2015-09-17,Richard Bratby,"There’s just something about an opera orchestra when it’s let out of the pit. The Royal Danish Orchestra is more than that, of course – it makes much of its six centuries of history, and since its past members included John Dowland, Heinrich Schütz and Carl Nielsen, why wouldn’t it? But the qualities that leapt out most energetically from this concert at Symphony Hall – the Orchestra’s sole UK date on a brief European tour – were those you’d expect from a band with theatre in its blood: a vivid sense of musical characterisation, and an instinct for pacing a musical argument over an evening, rather than a movement.That instinct was all the more striking when you saw the way the orchestra’s principal conductor, Michael Boder (pictured below by Alexander Vasiljev), went about his business. A slight, elegant figure, he looked at times to be to be doing almost nothing beyond giving a tidy, unwavering beat. He simply stood there at the centre while around him his orchestra surged, danced and – over the 15-minute expanse of Per Nørgård’s Iris – shaped the musical line in one ravishing musical arc.Opening with Iris was a bold move, and proof of the orchestra’s stated determination not to turn this year’s Nielsen anniversary into an exercise in nostalgia. But from the whispered rustle of the violins’ opening paragraphs to the way the clarinet melody rose, late in the work, from within tissue-like orchestral textures, it could have been written for Symphony Hall, and the RDO players approached it like chamber music. Iris dates from 1968, and its place in this programme seemed like a deliberate attempt to assert classic status. On the strength of this performance, that seemed reasonable enough.Still, even in 2015 nothing proclaims seriousness of intent quite like Schoenberg; it’s a depressing thought that Magdalena Anna Hofmann’s performance of Erwartung is almost certainly the reason why the house was less than half-full. The piece is a natural for an opera orchestra, of course, and Boder and the RDO darted, shimmered and swirled under and around Hofmann’s dark, lustrous voice without a false step. Hofmann herself told Schoenberg and Pappenheim’s horror story with cool control; as the implications of the words flashed across her face, she never forced her tone or descended into melodrama – making her short, sudden bursts of vocal characterisation all the more powerful. A ghoulishly rolled “r” here, a low hint of a snarl there: this performance was both intensely beautiful and unsparingly honest. On the opera stage, it would have been devastating.Unsparing honesty is very much Carl Nielsen’s line of business too; and with the Fifth Symphony we finally had a chance to hear Boder let his players off the leash. Woozy, overripe bassoons gasped out the opening theme; the percussion launched into their onslaught with raw malice, and the principal clarinettist peacocked shamelessly. No question, the RDO came across as an orchestra with character to spare. But the impression of a super-sized chamber group coalesced here into something more powerful.No-one would say that the RDO strings (pictured above by Natascha Tara Rydvald) have a luxurious sound, but their transparency and sonorous power whipped up a genuinely menacing storm in the first of the second movement’s great fugal episodes. Put simply, they sounded like they meant it. All this, while Boder maintained his undemonstrative beat: letting his players play, and trusting them to understand where he was taking them – in this case, through a symphonic struggle which found resolution only at the last possible moment: almost at the very last note. The stakes can rarely have felt higher, and there was a slightly hysterical, off-the-hook edge to the encore (an uproariously OTT Nielsen Maskarade overture). In an uncompromising programme, perhaps Boder and the RDO’s greatest achievement was making the 150-year old Carl Nielsen seem the most dangerous man in the room.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/hofmann-royal-danish-orchestra-boder-symphony-hall-birmingham,5
288,"Trofonio’s Cave, Bampton Opera",Trofonio’s Cave,Bampton Opera,2015-09-16,Peter Quantrill,"Antonio Salieri. Mozart’s nemesis – wrong. Beethoven’s teacher – right. Unjustly neglected in his own right – maybe. Bampton Opera have put some flesh on the bones of his reputation with an English-language production of La grotto di Trifonio, first performed in Vienna, October 1785. They have done Salieri proud: we can see for ourselves why he is who he is.He wrote a later operatic entertainment whose title encapsulates the tension at the heart of opera: First the music, and then the words. So, first the music. It’s heady stuff. Richly chromatic, sumptuously orchestrated, easing in and out of dissonance with the same mastery of craft that he uses to blend horns and bassoons on the composer’s palette, or accompany a lovely tenor aria with a bass running gently beneath tweets and trills from soft flutes that later turn up in the slow movement of Beethoven’s Pastoral Symphony. Paul Wingfield’s direction of the Chroma Ensemble was fleet and well-pointed, keeping the trumpets down and giving free rein to some fine continuo playing from Marek Ruszczynski.Then the words. The plot is a calculated comedy of confused identities, stuffed with popular tropes and archetypes to hit the operatic jackpot of the day. Two sisters, one serious, one frivolous? Check. Both in couples, split by misunderstanding? Check. A magus-figure of outlandish power and uncertain motives? Check. Around this time a ""Let’s make an opera"" handbook was written in which Gottlieb Stephanie, librettist to Mozart for Die Entführung aus dem Serail, passed on his wisdom to aspiring librettists and composers. Though Salieri and his librettist Giambattista Casti were too experienced to need Stephanie’s help, it’s as if they studied every word and then wrote Trifonio’s Cave, with arias, duets and ensembles all present and correct. More to the point, it seems impossible that Mozart and da Ponte didn’t sit in the Burgtheater in 1785 to watch, listen and learn. Così fan tutte was first staged there five years later.The translation is the work of the Bampton Opera’s co-artistic directors, Gilly French and Jeremy Gray, made with the experience of staging the UK premiere of Salieri’s Falstaff in 2003, and many other classical-era rarities since then. It’s as quick and witty as Jeremy Sams’ work for ENO, and no less susceptible to the kind of cognitive dissonance that arises from an 18th-century plot, updated in Gray’s own staging to a Coward-era setting of tea-dresses and tweed, in which a character can exclaim “Alas and alack” one moment, followed hard by “He’s just a charlatan, a nutcase”, like the waterbottle on the mantelpiece in Downton. At least, thanks to superb diction from all the singers, every word came through, and without the aid of surtitles.That character is Aristone, the sisters’ father, and James Harrison made the best of his blustery aria to open the second act. The Fiordiligi-prototype is Ofelia, sung earlier in the summer by Anna Starushkevych, but visa problems prevented her from rejoining the company for this performance at St John’s Smith Square; she was bravely replaced onstage by the assistant stage manager, Marieke Bernard-Berkel, and the part fearlessly sung from the wings by Catherine Backhouse.Ofelia’s sister is Dori (da Ponte could have tried harder there), who may not have Ofelia’s vocal pyrotechnics but Aoife O’Sullivan stole the show nonetheless, with good comic timing and a warmly poised lyric soprano. Before venturing into his cave (cue more smutty translation), they were joined by Trofonio (Matthew Stiff) for the score’s “Soave s’il vento” moment. Opening with a gravely imposing D minor pronouncement, Stiff had the required vocal gravity. As Ofelia’s fiancé Artemidoro, Christopher Turner made a convincing transformation from heroic oaf back to ardent philosopher, trading smart banter with his fellow-suitor Nicholas Merryweather (as Plistene, pictured above, with Aoife O'Sullivan).The evening flew by but, if anything, the familiarity it afforded with the material and context of da Ponte and Mozart’s partnership only increased my appreciation of their originality. Salieri’s vocal lines can be pretty adventurous, but they are pretty all-the-same. Where he was content with sweet harmony in the pit and confusion on stage, Mozart/da Ponte fused the two. Trofonio’s Cave is six characters in search of a drama; Così is where they find it.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/trofonio%E2%80%99s-cave-bampton-opera,4
289,"Orphée et Eurydice, Royal Opera",Orphée et Eurydice,Royal Opera,2015-09-15,alexandra Coghlan,"The tale of Orpheus – a musician so talented his art could overturn the laws of the universe – is the originary myth of opera itself. Is it any wonder, then, that it’s a story that the genre continues to tell and retell with such care and fascination? Three versions, spanning almost four centuries from Rossi’s 1647 Orpheus to Little Bulb Theatre’s 21st-century production, punctuate the current Royal Opera House season, starting with Gluck’s Orphée et Eurydice – seen for the first time in the company’s history in its French reworking.Dominated almost to the point of imbalance by its ballet interludes, Gluck’s telling more than any other celebrates music itself – the heroic force for which the grieving Orpheus is merely a vessel. It’s with this in mind that directors John Fulljames and Hofesh Shechter put music quite literally front and centre, raising conductor John Eliot Gardiner and his period English Baroque Soloists out of the pit and onto the stage (the Hofesh Schechter Company with English Baroque soloists, pictured below). There, by means of some magical hydraulics, they rise and fall – at times hovering above the action on a raised platform, at others sunk down into the body of the stage itself.This stratified, hierarchical design, with its gentle suggestion of Underworld, Earth and the kingdom of the Gods, provides the framework for a contemporary reworking that keeps sets and props to a minimum, establishing space and spaces for the chorus and Shechter’s dancers to inhabit. Inevitably there have already been dark murmurings about multi-storey carparks. Ignore them. Conor Murphy’s designs balance their architectural sobriety with delicacy and beauty – a bronze roof punctured with beams of starry light for the Dance of the Blessed Spirits is just one memorable gesture.An opera of just three principals cannot take too much visual embellishment before getting lost in it, especially – as here – when both chorus and dancers are so dominant a presence. Through careful use of lighting (beautifully designed by Lee Curran) Fulljames and Shechter manage to retain the essential intimacy of this chamber drama, occasionally widening the beam to invite the community in before closing back down to spotlight focus once again.It helps that solo and chorus forces are each so outstanding – a natural dramatic foil for one another. Juan Diego Florez’s technique serves him well through this punishingly high-lying role (“Amour viens rendre à mon âme” unfolds in easy coloratura spasms of grief), but more impressive than his signature solid top-notes and projection is the fragility he manages to bring to the role. At times his technique can almost seem the enemy of characterisation, so reliably and assertively heroic, whatever the scenario. Here, however, he finds an unsettling desperation, redeploying his virtuosity as maddened urgency.Lucy Crowe’s Eurydice is warm and lovely, human-frail in her jealous insecurity but crucially never petulant. Her rounded tone balances Florez’s bladed delivery, making much of the duets. American soprano Amanda Forsyth makes a spunky Amour (pictured below), all gold lamé suit and cheeky jobsworth attitude – saving the day, but only just. The ringing purity of her “Soumis au silence” played off nicely against her irreverence, the only touch of dramatic light in an otherwise sober production.Gluck saves much of his finest vocal writing for the chorus, and Gardiner’s Monteverdi Choir here showed just why it pays to bring in specialists (nightmares of the ENO chorus recent Indian Queen still haunt me) to sing music they understand so well. Bleeding in and out from among the Hofesh Shechter Company dancers, the chorus mourned and rejoiced with sensitive musicality, acting vocally with even more colours and subtleties than the principals. Where they added emotional depth and static beauty, their dancing alter egos (propelled by the Gardiner’s briskly organic speeds and the vibrant playing of the English Baroque Soloists) brought much-needed energy. Shechter’s convulsive choreography won’t be to everyone’s taste, but its battle between classical rigidity and primal, broken twitchings and flailings speaks to the revolutionary quality of Gluck’s “reform” opera, finding a contemporary echo to its still-shockingly contemporary dramatic gestures.A thoughtful, softly-spoken season-opener, Orphée et Eurydice bodes well for what’s to come at the Royal Opera House – a production whose music alone will surely preserve it from the operatic Underworld.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/orph%C3%A9e-et-eurydice-royal-opera,4
290,"I Puritani, Welsh National Opera",I Puritani,Welsh National Opera,2015-09-12,stephen Walsh,"Whatever one may feel about Bellini’s music, it’s hard to think of him as in any sense a political composer. So you could almost hear the hearts hit the floor when the curtain went up – or rather was as usual already up – on the opening of Bellini’s Puritani with Orangemen and a scruffy Catholic Arturo instead of good old Roundheads and Cavaliers. Surely Annilese Miskimmon isn’t trying to make Bellini relevant and meaningful, with Elvira’s madness as some kind of reductio ad absurdum of power-sharing.To tell the truth, I’m still not sure what political point she is making here, or even whether she is making a political point at all. The most striking moment of the production, and by far its most memorable passage, is Arturo’s first official entrance as a Cavalier aristocrat (the scruffiness is part of the usual preludial dumb-crambo), and Elvira’s switch from blue twin set, vintage 1970, to a flowing dress of the civil war time. Here something subtle and intriguing takes place. The flowing dress has already appeared while the twin set was onstage and singing; but soon the flowing dress is singing while the twin set looks on. Double casting? No, but a doppelganger, cunningly staged and designed (by Leslie Travers): a figment of Elvira’s mental instability, an image of the dreams she harbours, and an echo, presumably, of her crazed complaint that her separation from Arturo has been, not three months, but “tre secoli,” three centuries.The idea of antique style observed and antique disasters relived is touching and momentarily vivid. It suits Bellini, whose treatment of subject-matter is stereotyped and stylised. But alas it doesn’t work for the drama in the long term. In the final act Miskimmon brings us back to Ulster with a bump and not knowing quite why. Elvira, once lovely in her portrait gown, is again drab and dumpy in office blue (pictured left with Barry Banks), her misery commonplace. And to cap it all, Bellini’s happy ending is transformed into a tragedy with Arturo murdered by the Orangemen who have just been instructed (admittedly by a Roundhead herald) to release him. This absurdity turns Bellini, whose music remains happy, into an ironist; and it also – a minor detail perhaps – involves a change in the final ensemble, with Arturo’s voice absent.An interesting failure, then, but with a number of redemptive features. Chief among them is the Elvira of Rosa Feola, a marvellous singing actress, in full command of the part’s range and coloratura, and with poise and a fine sense of nineteenth-century visual idiom, that slightly exaggerated choreography of the body that we associate, rightly or wrongly, with the great romantic actors from Irving to Ellen Terry. Her mad scene, especially, is a masterclass in refined excess: in knowing, in Cocteau’s phrase, how far you can go too far. And, by the way, it’s exquisitely sung.The support is good enough, sometimes better than that. Barry Banks is a fluent, eloquent Arturo, David Kempster a resonant if elderly-looking Riccardo, Wojtek Gierlach an exact, mildly self-important uncle Giorgio. Elena Thomas floats round effectively as Elvira’s double, cleverly half-lit (and Mark Jonathan’s haunting use of shadows deserves mention). Best of all, as so often here, is the chorus singing and orchestral playing under Carlo Rizzi. Never mind the voices; this is a score very finely wrought for orchestra, with particularly memorable writing for horns and high woodwind. No wonder Wagner and Chopin both loved Bellini. Amid all the rum-ti-tum there’s a lot to admire.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/i-puritani-welsh-national-opera,3
291,"The Magic Flute, Komische Oper Berlin, Edinburgh Festival Theatre",The Magic Flute,Komische Oper Berlin,2015-08-29,alexandra Coghlan,"In 2007, a tiny British theatre company called 1927 staged their first ever show at the Edinburgh Fringe – the darkly reimagined collection of fairytales and fables Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea. Now, almost a decade on, they are back where it all began – not at the Fringe but the Edinburgh International Festival, with their acclaimed Komische Oper production of The Magic Flute.If you’ve seen any of 1927’s recent theatre work – The Animals and Children Took to the Streets or Golem – you’ll be familiar with an aesthetic that blends live action and animation to create dystopian worlds that are a little bit Weimar and a little bit punk, bladed humour cutting cleanly through political hypocrisy and social affectation. If Mozart’s kitschy-fantastical singspiel seems like an unlikely choice for their first opera, it’s an odd coupling that generates satisfying dramatic friction – even if they and director Barrie Kosky still can’t quite make sense of the awkward symbolism of the plot.In many ways this Magic Flute is 1927-lite. Happy endings and love-at-first-sight are the order of the day in a production that strips away all spoken dialogue to reimagine the show as a silent movie: Pamina a Louise Brooks bobbed heroine and Papageno a Buster Keatonish sidekick. What keeps it all from slipping into stylish pastiche is the renegade imagination of 1927 animator Paul Barritt.Flying elephants, monsters in burlesque outfits, a laboratory of strange scientific contraptions and a Queen of the Night conceived as a giant spider are just some of the ideas flung out with joyous excess through the course of the evening, sheer creative energy and anarchy anchoring the show just the right side of sentimentality. Meticulously synchronised interactions between singers and animations free an opera too often incapable of realising the spectacle its plot demands, releasing it to become a freewheeling fantasy, with just a hint of philosophical bite.Sarastro (Dmitry Ivashchenko) becomes a stern Victorian gentleman, all bloodless propriety and big whiskers. He and his identikit followers try to lure Pamina and Tamino back into their proto-scientific world, covering the progressive Pamina up in a crinoline and repressing the young prince’s individuality in a stern uniform. Torn between regressive moral control on the one hand and the Queen of the Night’s animal violence on the other, the two choose love – though how we are to read their initiation into the cult remains unclear. A final tableau suggests that the young lovers do eventually manage to persuade Sarastro and his hangers-on round to their own point of view.There’s no doubting the fertility and energy of 1927’s imagination here, and it all bodes well for their future show for the Royal Opera’s Linbury Studio Theatre, where they will be freed from the shackles of a pre-existing opera and will co-create together with composer Richard Ayres. But in terms of execution, this Edinburgh iteration of the production had a few issues.You can see the logic of conductor Kristiina Poska’s vigorous, driving interpretation, but to be denied any moment of let-up or musical pause throughout the entire evening is to wilfully misread the score. Playful momentum is appealing and appropriate to the visuals of this production, but can only shine in contrast and juxtaposition with moments of stillness and greater intensity. On opening night singers and pit parted company more than once, with vocal entries snatched and almost missed on several occasions. The orchestra itself was a mixed bag – collectively a bit scrappy, but with individual contributions of tremendous beauty, including some exquisite flute solos.Vocally too, things were mixed. An outstanding Queen of the Night from Olga Pudova attacked her victims with glittering coloratura arrows, devastatingly precise, and was neatly supported by a stylish trio of Ladies (Nina Bernsteiner, Karolina Gumos and Ezgi Kutlu). She met her match in the even tone and resonant lower register of Ivashchenko’s Sarastro, giving us the musical grounding that Dominik Koninger’s Papageno – a light, flexible baritone – lacked. Maureen McKay’s Pamina (pictured above with Koninger) was a little on the blunt side, but any weakness here was more than made up for by Allan Clayton’s heroic and unusually masculine Tamino, power taking nothing away from the delicacy of his phrasing.Ultimately, though, Kosky and 1927’s coup of a concept keeps a good production from ever reaching its full potential. By cutting spoken dialogue and anchoring characters in the static and distant drama of silent films, they deny these odd figures their humanity and development. Relationships sustained at a distance of some 10 metres across the stage cannot flourish, and however inventive and attractive the typography, captions cannot replace the emotion of spoken speech (however stilted).This Flute certainly is magical, but human it is not. As a one-off it’s enchanting, a miraculous exercise in visual invention, but when 1927 next return to opera they will need to find the emotional substance to match their visual style.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/magic-flute-komische-oper-berlin-edinburgh-festival-theatre,3
292,"Entanglement/ That Man Stephen Ward, Presteigne Festival",Entanglement/ That Man Stephen Ward,Presteigne Festival,2015-08-28,Richard Bratby,"Two dramas of sex, sleaze and death in the postwar London underworld: to outsiders, this double bill of chamber operas by Charlotte Bray and Thomas Hyde might look like an unlikely opening night for the annual Presteigne Festival. That would be to overlook the artistic direction of George Vass, whose commitment to new music has made this short, spirited festival just a couple of valleys over from Hay-on-Wye a chamber-sized successor-in-spirit to Cheltenham. This year’s programme features a residency by Matthew Taylor, premieres by David Matthews and Peteris Vasks and music by Piers Hellawell, Joseph Phibbs, Cecilia McDowall and the late John McCabe – all this in a Festival where you’re still pretty-much-guaranteed to bump into a composer in the pub or find the orchestra eating fish and chips in the churchyard pre-show.Charlotte Bray’s Entanglement, to a libretto by Amy Rosenthal, is a co-commission from the Presteigne and Cheltenham Festivals for Nova Music Opera, who gave its premiere in Cheltenham earlier this year. It retells the final days of the murderess Ruth Ellis with a bare minimum of means: three singers and a six-piece orchestra. Yet from its opening bars – a low shimmer from a gong, high-tension violin lines hanging in the air – it manages to convey the psychological tension and lingering, headache-like atmosphere of dread that permeates this whole remarkable score. Anyone who’s heard Bray’s orchestral works –  Black Rainbow, or her 2012 Proms commission At The Speed of Stillness – knows just how refined is her ear for instrumental colour, and for subtle but powerful musical gestures: like the way that ominous opening rumble from the gong returned, in the final Old Bailey scene, as a slowly chiming tocsin.Dramatically, Amy Rosenthal’s lucid, naturalistic libretto gives the composer plenty to work with, and over the course of its five short scenes Entanglement manages to create two genuinely credible characters, and to sketch in one other. As one corner of the love-triangle, the tenor Greg Tassell sang the part of David Blakeley with a dash and a sweetness straight out of Puccini – with music to match Ruth Ellis’s deluded vision of her abusive lover. If the drama has a weakness, it’s that we didn’t, perhaps, see enough of him to feel the roots of that delusion, though in Kirsty Hopkins’s concentrated, eerily beautiful performance as Ruth, we certainly felt its consequences. Bray’s music for Ruth veers from poignant, expressive arioso (“I’m not the kind of girl he could take home to meet his parents”) to chilling calm in the two final scenes, where she coolly dismisses the future of her children and invites her own death by hanging.Howard Quilla Croft as the romantic spare-wheel Desmond Cussen gave a quietly shattering performance in these scenes. The lumbering double bass line that had accompanied his earlier scenes now broke into a quivering tremolando, and Croft pushed his baritone agonisingly into the tenor register as Desmond made his final despairing attempt to make Ruth see in him what she saw in the brutish David. Simply staged by director Richard Williams with minimal lighting and back-projected captions, and eloquently conducted by Vass, Entanglement created characters that live with you after the drama has ended: a sure-fire sign that it needs to be seen again, and soon.The same basic staging served after the interval for a revival of Thomas Hyde’s 2008 Hampstead and Highgate Festival commission That Man Stephen Ward; essentially a one-man show told from inside the Walter Mitty-like imagination of the Profumo affair’s “society osteopath”. Damian Thantrey was that man last night (pictured above), and if the solo format placed some limitations on the storytelling – most troublingly, the presentation of Christine Keeler (gamely played by Agnes Vane) as a wordless fantasy-object – this was an extraordinary vehicle for Thantrey’s handsome baritone, his drolly-nuanced sprechgesang, and his ability to create a character and his world with a raised eyebrow, a complacent smirk, or a sudden, wide-eyed glance of dismay.Capering suavely and nimbly round David Norris’s playful libretto, and colouring his voice to match the constant shifts of Hyde’s enjoyably decadent score (which veered tipsily from cabaret piano to Bergian angst; imagine a pocket-sized Powder Her Face), Thantrey inhabited the character of this Playboy-era man without qualities with unnerving believability. Sex, sleaze and death in a medieval church in a pretty Welsh market town. Well, what d’you know? It brought the house down.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/entanglement-man-stephen-ward-presteigne-festival,4
293,"Prom Chamber Music 6: Jeremy Denk/ Prom 53: Fray, Philharmonia, Salonen",Prom Chamber Music 6: Jeremy Denk/ Prom 53: Fray,Philharmonia,2015-08-25,David Nice,"There were two reasons why I didn’t return to the Albert Hall late on Friday night to hear Andras Schiff play Bach’s Goldberg Variations. The first was that one epic, Mahler’s Sixth in the stunning performance by Andris Nelsons and the Boston Symphony Orchestra, needed properly digesting. The other was that at Easter I’d heard Jeremy Denk play the Goldbergs in Weimar, and I wanted that approach to resonate, too – dynamic, continuous, revelatory, in a very different way from how I know Schiff approaches Bach.Denk’s recitals are mandatory listening now, and the lunchtime recital yesterday at the Cadogan Hall (****) was no exception. It was far from light but perfectly digestible, since his approach to the two potential heavyweights leading up to the magnum opus of Beethoven’s last sonata made easy and even exultant work of violent discords. Scriabin’s Ninth, “Black Mass” Sonata, didn’t seem Satanic or scary at all with this kind of intellectual torch shone on it; with very little sustaining pedal, its harmonic experimentations seemed not whimsical or self-indulgent but clean and natural – an astonishingly effective prelude, in fact.Michael Tilson Thomas, with whom Denk (pictured right by Michael Wilson) appears in Henry Cowell’s Piano Concerto in Sunday evening’s Prom, once talked about the “exultation of the dissonance” in hard-hitting scores of the 1920s, and exultant was exactly how the opening movement of Bartók’s Piano Sonata came across, dancing in what Denk with typical wit described as “that Hungarian groove”. Different colours lit various chords or notes in the slow movement, and the tumultuous repeated-note finale may have done for the middle C on the Cadogan Steinway, though it only began to sound unhealthy in Beethoven’s Op. 111.Unfortunate, that, since C – first minor, then major – is the home key of this poleaxing masterpiece. Talking to Petroc Trelawny before it, Denk gave insights of incredible concision, especially when it came to the nature of the Arietta’s gobsmacking variations. All was clarity again, with space for special articulation, and nothing neutral, even if I’ve heard pianists make more of the lower register and the spirituality of the later stages. A sequence of trills apart, Denk’s Beethoven remained resolutely of this world. As, inevitably, his perfect choice of the only possible thing to follow that – the central movement of Mozart’s last sonata, with its far more cheek-by-jowl light and shade – did not.The pianist in the Mozart concerto of the evening's Prom (***), David Fray, made his presence less strongly felt than the effortlessly elegant and human woodwind of Esa-Pekka Salonen’s Philharmonia. Certainly that sublime ensemble led the way in so many of the late C minor Concerto’s inspired ideas, but it’s up to the pianist to match them for imagination. Fray produced a crystalline tone, much less veiled than Elisabeth Leonskaja’s in the E flat major Concerto last Thursday; but he rarely made much of the phrases, with the simple theme of the slow movement very much a test he failed, and more worryingly he never forged a true relationship with his orchestra and conductor (as Leonskaja so effortlessly had), curved instead introspectively around his keyboard.Salonen (pictured left) had already tested the two other works on the programme in previous Philharmonia seasons. There’s no doubt no end of polishing and fine-tuning that can be done to Bartók’s pantomime-ballet score The Miraculous Mandarin, especially in the protracted endgame in which the mysterious protagonist refuses to die at the hands of a prostitute and her thugs. By choosing to open with the complete ballet rather than the suite, which ends with the stomp before the murder, and doing without the helpful action supertitles which had guided the audience at the Festival Hall, Salonen set himself, his orchestra and the briefly engaged wordless chorus a challenge which they faced with extremes of sonorities; never has the score sounded more contemporary, yet at the same time so romantically tender. Awed salutes to clarinettist Mark van de Wiel, who played the girl’s three ""decoy games"" so very humanly, and to a guest principal timpanist of amazing presence and strength, Paul Philbert.In terms of great 20th century music, that was it for the evening. At around the same half-hour mark, the Prologue to a 1932 opera for the 15th anniversary of the October revolution Shostakovich could probably never have finished even for a fortune, Orango, muddled along aimlessly, with a repellent dimension in the way director Irina Brown in a more than semi-staging made the Prommers and some of the folk in the boxes complicitly infantile in waving red flags for this piece of shoddy Soviet agitprop. Bad taste; would they have waved little swastikas with the same mindless enthusiasm, all in ""good fun""?Yes, the opera might have become more interesting when the man-ape of the title turns out to be more human than all the spectators, but the subtext was virtually non-existent in the hastily cobbled together gallops, marches and waltzes. Gerard McBurney has done a vintage job in orchestrating those bits that don’t come from the ballet The Bolt in true young-red-Shostakovich style, with piercing trumpets as well as the odd contribution from flutter-tonguing brass and wind and that flailing metal oddity, the flexatone. Salonen conducted it all with his usual precision, energy and focus, but to what end?It’s pointless to credit any of the Russian singers, given their negligible roles; the Proms could have saved a lot of money and done it – preferably in English, since they still don’t “do” surtitles at the Albert Hall – with students from one of the UK music colleges (there was a Scottish-bron, London-trained dancer/choreographer, though, Rosie Kay as Nastya Terpsikhorova, pictured above). Better still to have put on an act of music from the best of the three early ballets, The Golden Age. Those who didn't know Shostakovich had a raucous sense of humour might find Orango amusing for a while. But as one of Prokofiev’s professors put it about another piece of ephemera, it's the sort of thing that's “interesting for the history of music, but not for music”. Roll on the real thing, Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk – during work on which Shostakovich toyed with Orango – at the London Coliseum next month.Read theartsdesk's reviews of other concerts from the BBC Proms 2015",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/prom-chamber-music-6-jeremy-denk-prom-53-fray-philharmonia-salonen,
294,"The Last Hotel, Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh",The Last Hotel,Royal Lyceum,2015-08-12,David Kettle,"Irish playwright Enda Walsh has been a regular presence at recent Edinburgh festivals – or, to be more precise, at the Fringe, with provocative works of rich linguistic lyricism including The Walworth Farce in 2007 and The New Electric Ballroom in 2008. This year marks his first foray into the Edinburgh International Festival, and it’s with a very different work. The Last Hotel, receiving its world premiere there, is Walsh’s first opera libretto, a collaboration with Irish composer Donnacha Dennehy. It’s a terse, aphoristic text that at times has shades of Beckett – probably fitting for a piece of music theatre on the theme of assisted suicide.A trio of awkward companions arrives at an anonymous hotel, staffed by a hyperactive caretaker (a magnificent physical performance from regular Walsh collaborator Mikel Murfi, pictured below). Their banal conversations grow increasingly strained as they dodge the issue in front of them; they stage a chilling rehearsal involving a seal-tight plastic bag and a canister of gas; and they dance at a crummy disco before the inevitable act the following day.It’s bleak, dismal stuff, but what makes Walsh and Dennehy’s opera so gripping is its volatile, alienating mix of the shocking and the bathetic. The woman who intends to end her life (sung with unnerving enthusiasm by a silver-toned Claudia Boyle) seems to lose consciousness with her head sealed inside a plastic bag, while elsewhere the man administering the gas (a powerful Robin Adams) sings in detail of the kitchen extension her fee will bring him. The woman callously rejects her children, while the trio weigh up the pros and cons of ferries versus planes.Dennehy’s music – kind of Nyman-meets-Andriessen – follows a similar formula throughout, of building rippling post-minimalist textures through combining melodic cells across his pit ensemble, which adds the distinctive sounds of pan pipes, accordion and electric guitar to conventional strings, woodwind and brass. Dennehy switches textures and harmonies to describe contrasting characters, or builds to huge climaxes simply by adding more layers to his clouds of counterpoint. It’s simple, but highly effective – and made all the more alienating by the intrusion of warped pop music recordings (most memorably, B*Witched’s 1997 shocker ""C’est la vie"" for the hotel’s violent nightclub scene).His vocal writing is for the most part grateful and lyrical, if unpredictable, and his final duet, sung by the woman from beyond the grave alongside her executioner’s wife, reaches a kind of fractured ecstasy as both fantasise on simply no longer needing to care. Jamie Vartan’s startling stage design places the action in a drab backstage or hospital area littered with crushed plastic cups and suitcases – possibly memories of the people who have been here before this trio. André de Ridder conducts Dennehy’s own Crash Ensemble with swagger and enthusiasm, and they respond with a bright, urgent performance.New Festival director Fergus Linehan has admitted it’s an on-going financial challenge to bring large-scale staged opera to the Edinburgh International Festival, and that he’s seeking new ways of satisfying the demand for it. On the strength of Walsh and Dennehy’s challenging but hugely accomplished chamber opera, Linehan might just have found a new way forward. It’s a superb addition to the repertoire, rich, strange, darkly comic and thoroughly beguiling.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/last-hotel-royal-lyceum-edinburgh,5
295,"HMS Pinafore, National Gilbert & Sullivan Opera Company",HMS Pinafore,National Gilbert & Sullivan Opera Company,2015-08-10,Richard Bratby,"At the beginning of Act Two of John Savournin’s production of HMS Pinafore, the quarterdeck is in darkness. Kevin Greenlaw’s Captain Corcoran steps out of his cabin, downs a brandy stiffener, and launches into his melancholy lament to the moon. Woodwinds echo the ends of sighing phrases as the strings pluck their accompaniment: something about this sounds familiar. And as cymbals clash melodramatically and David Steadman, conducting, underlines the ominous chromatic rise and fall of the bass line in Little Buttercup’s fateful duet with the Captain, the target of Sullivan’s musical satire comes into plain focus.It’s pure coincidence that the National Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company’s Pinafore arrived at the Buxton Opera House so soon after the Buxton Festival’s productions of Lucia di Lammermoor and Verdi’s Giovanna d’Arco, but there’s no denying that it gave an additional naughty thrill to this perfectly shipshape production. Part of the general delight at the recent ENO Pirates of Penzance seems to have come from the now-unfamiliar experience of hearing big operatic voices in G&S and this Pinafore benefitted, at least in part, from the same effect. With singers who’ve been actual Violettas and Figaros, Sullivan’s musical parodies bite just as sharply as Gilbert’s words.As Sir Joseph, Richard Gauntlett’s comic timing is in the Richard Suart classIn-house professional productions have long been at the core of Ian Smith’s annual International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival, currently and controversially based in Harrogate after 20 years at Buxton. But the Festival has only begun touring its productions since last year, and it may be significant that they’ve started back in Buxton – where the locals still feel a definite sense of ownership. (“That’ll be the G&S crowd,” quipped the cashier at Scrivener’s bookshop as a boozy cheer exploded from the pub across the road). This Pinafore, along with The Gondoliers and The Mikado, will be on the road until November.And outwardly at least, this is straight-down-the-line G&S: naturalistic sets, bright period costumes – it was a nice touch to distinguish Sir Joseph Porter KCB’s sisters, cousins and aunts so clearly, with cousin Hebe (Nichola Jolley) flashing a racy glimpse of bloomer below her ankle-length skirts – smart, exuberant choreography and at least one Savoyard in the grand tradition. As Sir Joseph, Richard Gauntlett’s comic timing is in the Richard Suart class. His mugging and capering during ""Never Mind the Why and Wherefore"" practically brought the show to a halt, while his slightly-too-enthusiastic interest in the Pinafore’s crew hinted at the salacious undercurrents that we’re always being told aren’t present in G&S.The other character roles were just as fully inhabited – and more than adequately sung. Bruce Graham wasn’t the most vicious Dick Deadeye we’ve seen, but his deep, oily bass clarinet of a voice was one of the most expressive. Sylvia Clarke’s Buttercup was the classic G&S mezzo, with enough gravitas to act as a plausible anchor for the drama even as – to music worthy of an early Verdi witching scene – she explains its daftest twists. Oliver White, as Ralph Rackstraw (pictured above with fellow seamen and Elinor Jane Moran's Josephine) seemed to be having an off-night, vocally – in every other respect, it’s hard to imagine Gilbert’s “remarkably fine fellow” better cast.But two voices stood out. Greenlaw’s credits include Don Giovanni and Count Almaviva, and there was a tiny but sufficient hint of darkness about his Captain Corcoran – a man on the edge, whose air of relief at his final demotion made as much dramatic sense as probably can be made of one of Gilbert’s loopiest plot twists. And as Josephine, Elinor Jane Moran played it absolutely, magnificently straight. With her bright-as-a-bell soprano, she scampered effortlessly and brilliantly over Sullivan’s coloratura and flung out her horrified vision of “dinner served up in a pudding basin” with the vocal steel of a Lucia or Lady Macbeth.There are caveats: this remains a low budget-touring production. The opening scenes could be tighter (why leave the curtain up on an empty stage throughout the overture, then black out at the start of Act One?). The lighting was hit-and-miss and the strings of the National Festival Orchestra sounded undernourished (lovely oboe playing, though). Hopefully these are the sort of things which will shake down on tour. But on top of the individual and ensemble performances all the jokes land, a good 90% of the words are audible, it’s bright, lively, and – musically – finds more in Sullivan’s score than many of us will ever have heard in a live production.

296,"Ravel Double Bill, Glyndebourne",Ravel Double Bill,Glyndebourne,2015-08-09,David Nice,"Ask opera-lovers to name their favourite one-acter and chances are the choice will be L’enfant et les sortilèges. Colette’s typically off-kilter fable of a destructive kid confronted with the objects and animals he’s damaged is set by Maurice Ravel to music of a depth which must have taken even that unshockable author by surprise. Ravel’s earlier L’heure espagnole, on the other hand, is much less likely to be top of the list. The farcical ‘Spanish hour’ – 50 minutes, to be precise, and Ravel’s sense of timing otherwise is – proves only one thing: how potent a cheap plot can be when the music accompanying it is of extraordinary subtlety and strangeness.Bringing the two closer together in this much-awaited Glyndebourne revival are not just Ravel’s equally exquisite scores, as fastidiously conducted by Robin Ticciati, and the luminous wit of director Laurent Pelly with his amazing visual sense but also, this time round, a surprising double whammy from Glyndebourne chatelaine and stage animal Danielle de Niese (pictured below with Etienne Dupuis). She’s treading the boards again first as naughty bored housewife who gets away with it then as naughty bored child who doesn’t, having just added her own, hopefully more biddable offspring to the Christie household.There’s no room for self-indulgence here. Pelly’s movements in the Spanish bagatelle are as precise as every horological tick and character tic in the score, for all its sensuous bathing in various supernatural lights. The clockmaker’s workshop of designers Caroline Ginet and Florence Evrard gives us a wealth of Iberiana to look at, including kitsch religious art and Velazquez in lurid frames, so the singers need to be directed to the hilt to hold our attention. As they are and as they do, with a little help from Pelly’s costumes hinting at Almódovar.For the not-so-discreet charms of the Spanish bourgeoisie, we have two bright French tenors in François Piolino as clockmaker Ramiro and Cyrille Dubois as flared aesthete Gonzalve, as well as Lionel Lhote struggling a bit with the low notes as sleazy banker Don Inigo Gómez and star stud muleteer Ramiro, and Etienne Dupuis as sensitive with some of the vocal writing as he is appropriately muscly in appearance.What big laughs there are have mostly to do with the ease of Ramiro’s clockcase carrying and the cases’ phallic propensities (Franc-Nohain’s text is very Carry On double entendre in the first place, reference to swinging pendulums outrageously so). The rest is titter-worthy but not belly-laugh hilarious, though de Niese’s Spanish seductress, tout le monde sur le balcon as the French say, has a wonderful array of funny gestures and eloquent hand movements, and pulls out all the stops, no mere soubrette soprano in a mezzo role, in the nearest thing to a big solo, “Oh! La pitoyable aventure”. There are equal if fleeting star turns from the London Philharmonic principals, not least deliciously flaccid trombone slides (Mark Templeton, I presume) for the old man who can’t get it up.Feline fornication is the only truly adult intrusion into the world of L’enfant, and there’s another brilliantly spinning clockface here too, but otherwise it couldn’t be more different and nor could de Niese, instantly the garçon mechant as she/he swings his/her legs restlessly on a giant chair in the opening of many breathtaking visuals. We know we’re going to love this kid, and de Niese soon brings pathos and horror to the child lost in a dream that’s mostly a nightmare.Barbara de Limburg, creator of the supermarket witch’s house in Pelly’s Glyndebourne Hänsel und Gretel, exercises restraint but also a bewitching framework for Pelly’s breathtaking costumes here as one scene glides into another. So the first half is less the usual revue, more a fluent story against the odds of Ravel’s and Colette’s demands, and Pelly does better than any director I’ve seen in not getting too much in the way of the more heartbreaking music (shepherds and shepherdesses from the torn wallpaper pictured above, princess who’s lost her storyline).There's also a great idea as the henchmen of Monsieur l'Arithmétique turn out to be multiple images of our child, spiritedly sung by local Sussex schoolboys, whose bullying adds to the terror of the maths lecture (pictured below).Choreography – presumably by Pelly himself – for what began as a supernatural opera-ballet in the Rameau tradition is discreet but elegant, with the usual showstopping in the Foxtrot for Teapot (Piolino again) and Chinese Cup (Elodie Méchain, also a glamorously large Maman and a very big Dragonfly) and a riveting flight for the Fire (Sabine Devieilhe, perfectly stratospheric in the three most demanding roles). Nothing could eclipse the breathtaking coup of David Hockney’s blue and red tree back in the 1980s (Royal Opera, Met, Chatelet) as the music shifts to swanee-whistling, string-carpeted evocation of a garden at night, but Pelly fills his natural world with more brilliant designs, including showgirl dryads – a neat reference, perhaps, to Colette's other career – and two luminous glow worms.How pleased Ticciati, a great proponent of meaningful silences between the music, as he told me when working on Glyndebourne Touring Opera’s Jenůfa before his big appointment as main Music Director, must have been with the infinite time it seems to take between the notes for the Child to bind the Nightingale’s wound (Squirrel in the scenario). His knack for seeming simplicity then keeps the potentially gooey wonder of the garden creatures at the naughty one’s kindness on the move, and the choral fugue that follows – an image of reconciliation after so much style-hopping – is sublime, as it must be. With Pelly’s last inspired image and de Niese making the most of her final “Maman”, the seal is set on a near-perfect evening of music theatre. Walking out into another garden on a perfect summer night seemed almost too good to be true.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/ravel-double-bill-glyndebourne-0,4
297,"Prom 25: Orfeo, EBS, Gardiner",Prom 25: Orfeo,EBS,2015-08-05,alexandra Coghlan,"English choirs and early music ensembles have a bad reputation for stiffness, formality – nothing wrong with the music, just the presentation. But with this dramatic and Italianate Orfeo, John Eliot Gardiner, his English Baroque Soloists and Monteverdi Choir, reminded us just what is possible when you combine English musicianship with a looser, more instinctive presentation.Gardiner and his forces have previous form; their 2012 Monteverdi Vespers at the Proms exploited every acoustic and spatial possibility of the Royal Albert Hall, and here once again their semi-staging inhabited the entire interior. The Messenger entered from among the Prommers, complete with accompanying Theorbo player, Gods descended from above, while echoes called back to Orpheus from the balcony. Even the ensemble weren’t confined to their seats, standing for a triumphant opening Toccata, brass roaming about to catch the acoustic.There were no surtitles, and frankly they weren’t necessary with so much stage business and vocal acting to narrate the familiar story. At the core of it all, the spirit of the performance, were Gardiner’s Monteverdi Choir. Singing from memory, this small group of young singers filled the RAH with their focused and wonderfully flexible sound, offering as much variations of colour and expressive shading as if they were solo voices singing Monteverdi madrigals in the Wigmore Hall, and not massed forces in London’s largest and most challenging classical venue. In addition to this they gamely danced, clapped and acted when required (which was frequently), bringing Monteverdi’s drama to natural and fluid life.Most exciting among an equally youthful team of soloists – many stepping out from the chorus – was Francesca Aspromonte, a piquant Music, seizing a baroque guitar from Gardiner to accompany herself in her opening sequence, and later a Messenger of tragic scope. Just occasionally pushed a little too hard, her tone offers everything from acid, bladed bite to softest caress. This is a voice, and a performer, to watch.A softer Eurydice/Hope from Mariana Flores was a lovely foil to Aspromonte’s vivid delivery – barely established before being snatched away from her wedding day – but physically very present in the drama thanks to some nice directorial touches and choreography. A trio of vividly characterised Shepherds from Andrew Tortise (also doing duty as Apollo, glowingly sung), Gareth Treseder and James Hall kept the music-drama flowing through their rather observational contributions aided by Esther Brazil's rich-toned Nymph, while Francesca Boncompagni made much of the cameo role of Proserpina, freshly and charmingly out of places in Hades, filling the space as easily with her light soprano as violinist Alina Ibragimova did over the weekend.Deceptively understated, Krystian Adam’s Orpheus played into the ensemble spirit of the show, only really stepping apart for the astonishing Act V monologue – meticulously embellished, but each ornament feeling like the natural extension of emotional extremity rather than a decoration. Never singing up to the venue, his performance demanded – and received – hush from a capacity crowd, all straining to catch every emotive detail.Orfeo is an opera all about the power of music. If John Eliot Gardiner and his musicians can’t quite claim to raise the dead yet, they certainly know how to charm the living, as this joyous evening of music-making proved so unarguably.Read theartsdesk's reviews of other concerts from the BBC Proms",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/prom-25-orfeo-ebs-gardiner,4
298,"Bakkhai, Almeida Theatre",Bakkhai,Almeida Theatre,2015-07-31,David Nice,"This is the real Greek, bloody-fantastical thing. After the fascinating but flawed attempt to bring Aeschylus’s Oresteia into the 21st century, the Almeida has turned to a more tradition-conscious kind of experiment with Euripides’ last and greatest masterpiece. James Macdonald’s production daringly fuses operatic settings of the essential Bacchic choruses by Orlando Gough, stunningly executed by 10 women, a mostly faithful translation rather than a “new version” by Anne Carson blending irony with pure poetry, and a central performance by Ben Whishaw surpassing expectations as an ideally mesmerizing Dionysos.Whishaw manages to be both epicene and sexy, softly spoken and menacing, fire and ice – some of the many polarities within a role which uses all manner of theatrical tricks to epitomise the dualities of the wine-god (helpfully listed in the programme).He starts out as a fey hippy, an androgynous guru whose promises seem unlikely to be fulfilled (pictured right). Yet this is only one of many guises for the god, or daimon as he’s called here; having slipped in a convincingly doddery Tiresias going off arm in arm to join the Bacchic revels with Kevin Harvey’s beautifully spoken Kadmos, Whishaw re-emerges as a still and seemingly wise threat to Bertie Carvel’s quietly brutal, repressive and repressed ruler Pentheus. The series of dialogues in which Pentheus rapidly loses control and ends up dressed as a prim lady of the pearls to go off and see what he imagines those women on the hills are up to has a good many laughs finely controlled by Whishaw’s delivery of Carson’s equally well modulated glidings in and out of bathos.  There’s also a sly reference to Carvel’s now-classic Miss Trunchbull in Matilda The Musical, but in true tragicomic style the laughter quickly freezes.There is music in Whishaw’s intonation, but the true lyric genius belongs to the stasimons of the Bacchae hanging around Thebes. We’ve had operas on the subject by Henze (The Bassarids) and John Buller, as well as a variation on the theme that steers clear of violent horror in Szymanowski’s King Roger, but none fits the Greek ideal and Euripides in translation better than Gough’s tour de force so magnificently rendered by women of diverse cultures and vocal training. It's also got more music in a single chorus than there was in the whole of ENO's dismal if well-executed Thebans. There’s consonant peace and beauty in the rhapsodies devoted to being at one with nature, but also an explosive violence in more dissonant delivery punctuated by vigorous thyrsos-thudding. Gough could have made it easier for himself and let more of the text simply be spoken in unison and rhythmically, but his singer-actresses (pictured below) are allowed to experiment with all sorts of voice production.The long, climactic choral scene between Pentheus’s arrival in the mountains and his shocking if prefigured end ripped to shreds by the god-crazed women is a symphony in itself, and if the metres aren’t the same as Euripides’, Carson and Gough find a visceral vein between the strange exultations. The score is easily the most tuned-in to the dramatic atmosphere since Birtwistle’s poleaxing work on Peter Hall’s National Theatre Oresteia back in the 1980s.Transitions are also effected by the electrical short-circuiting shocks in Paul Arditti’s soundscape, mostly eerie low-level sustained chords under the dialogue, and by the equally abrupt changes of Peter Mumford’s lighting. Antony McDonald’s design keeps it simple to match director Macdonald's clear vision, with a spare acting space surrounded by undulations of black gravel against the Almeida’s bare brick wall. There are more doubling surprises from two of the three male actors in the crucial messenger’s speech about what happened to Pentheus among the women and in the role of Pentheus’s horrifyingly deluded mother Agave (in Hall’s NT Bacchae, a wake-up call in the long sleep of the director's latter years, there was also doubling - see comment below - somewhat obscured by the masks).So the final scene in which reality strikes is not an anti-climax. In fact this production puts no single foot wrong in dance, delirium or idyll: it’s the complete experience, and though it’s so potent at such close quarters, its operatic dimension should make it a visitor to the Proms’ vast Albert Hall amphitheatre next season. In the meantime, I want a copy of Carson’s text - unusually not provided before the performance but now available (August update) in a publication from Oberon Classics - since it's far too rich to absorb on a single hearing.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/bakkhai-almeida-theatre,5
299,"Prom 11: Fiddler on the Roof, Grange Park Opera",Prom 11: Fiddler on the Roof,Grange Park Opera,2015-07-26,David Nice,"Stop miking Bryn Terfel. Stop over-miking musicals; the show voices in a hybrid cast don’t need much. Too much ruined English National Opera’s recent Sweeney Todd, and in this Proms adaptation of Grange Park Opera’s summer crowd-pleaser it sent the voices ricocheting around the Albert Hall, making mush of the words and stridency of the few belt-it-out moments. It also made it hard to assess what seemed like a resourceful staging of a baggy-monster musical with four or five great songs, no masterpiece of musical theatre (unlike My Fair Lady, Fiddler on the Roof’s near-contemporary).The idea of a shtetl show wasn’t at all a bad idea, and goes some way to accounting for Fiddler on the Roof’s enormous popularity on Broadway, where it ran for over seven years and over 3,000 performances. But Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick never found a meaningful way of binding together the Sholem Aleichem tales they selected. Despite the constant presence of a mournful fiddler (for Grange Park, Houcheng Kian, excellent), courtesy of Chagall, who hated the musical, and the various refrains of the opening number “Tradition” as that very supposed virtue falls apart, there’s no music for the real emotional core of the piece, or to lead the action forward, least of all in the two piecemeal finales.Best is the klezmer style that gives a special flavour to ensemble chutzpah and an almost painful bittersweet quality, especially wistful in ""Sunrise, Sunset"" and beautifully underlined by David Charles Abell’s sensitive sway over an often luminous BBC Concert Orchestra (the miking at least doesn't harm them as it did the Britten Sinfonia in the turkey of last year's Proms, the horrible Rufus Wainwright late-night indulgence). Abell has tracked down Don Walker’s long-lost original orchestrations, with soulful roles for accordion, mandolin and lute; it’s not surprising if the score occasionally joins hand with Shostakovich in Jewish folk poetic mood.Is the character of Tevye, the philosophical and (up to a point) adaptable milkman, enough to hold the show together? People used to think Chaim Topol did just that, though I found his routines cheesy when he returned to the role in London in 1983 (and I only ever got halfway through the film). Terfel's natural charisma and effortlessly dominating figure kept it all believably low-key except for the explosions of anger and tearful emotion. He phrased every number with originality, vocal colour – much as the amplification threatened to flatten it out – and suavity when needed; who thought “If I Were A Rich Man” could have sounded this fresh?Grange Park's supporting cast was good: Janet Fullerlove as the matriarch (pictured above with Terfel) brought much-needed pathos to her evasive answers in one of the only two numbers to stand out in Act Two, Tevye’s question “Do You Love Me?”, and Katie Hall struck the right note of pathos in the other, as the second of the five daughters to make her own marriage choice leaves to join her activist husband in Siberia. Jordan Simon Pollard as said idealist also managed to make something of one of the more anodyne numbers. The worst was an interminable scene in which Tevye fakes a nightmare to persuade his wife that another daughter should marry her beloved tailor and not the old butcher; it was mostly the miking’s fault if not a word could be made out of the two ghost-women in this narrative.Other set-pieces worked better, thanks mostly to the superb negotiation of the space in front of the orchestra and dance routines (one pictured above) from the ever-dependable Lucy Burge, with just the right degree of Jewish and Russian nationalist traditional steps (Burge didn'tget a biography in the programme; nor did the original director Antony McDonald, though there was one for the Proms stager Peter Relton). At moments like this the spirits soared, but Fiddler on the Roof is too much a work of fits and starts for the magic to last for long. Bring back Grange Park Opera to the Proms, bring Garsington and Longborough too, but mike-free.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/prom-11-fiddler-roof-grange-park-opera,3
300,"Xerxes, Longborough Opera",Xerxes,Longborough Opera,2015-07-26,stephen Walsh,"One hardly expects operas about historical figures to bother much with the actual facts of their lives. But Handel’s Xerxes must nevertheless rank as an extreme case. Instead of bridging the Hellespont and invading Greece with a million men – a campaign mentioned in passing as if it were some minor business trip – Xerxes spends his time philandering with his brother’s intended and generally creating emotional mayhem in the Persian court. Jenny Miller’s production transplants the action, somewhat irrelevantly, to a nightclub in, perhaps, Cairo or Palm Springs. But it hardly matters. It could be Putin in Petersburg for all the difference it makes to the drama or characterisation, such as they are.This is Longborough’s Young Artist production for 2015, and attention is very much on the cast and how they cope with this vocally treacherous music in an overcomplicated production that crowds the stage with singers, a 12-piece orchestra, and furniture that they themselves, from time to time, have to move around. Miller and her designer, Faye Bradley, seem to have gone out of their way to create a garish image of pink palm trees in a mauve-and-orange-lit décor peopled by call girls, waitresses and men in black tights, trilbies and dark glasses: coarse visual clichés that get laughs but tend to overrule the subtle humour of this rare comic opera by the master. The small stage is reduced still further by sheer clutter, to the great disadvantage of the music’s natural choreography.It’s fun watching the players, theorbo and all – a suitably surreal touchYet lo and behold, the result is musically something close to a triumph, thanks in no small measure to Jeremy Silvers’ expert direction from the harpsichord of his small band, which forms part of the scenery on a steepish rake angled outwards stage right. Apart from one brief moment when the trumpeter’s view was blocked by singers making their entrance, the ensemble was immaculate, the music’s varied flow beautifully maintained, the balance – tending to favour the voices – nearly ideal. Maybe the instrumental sound would be a touch warmer in the pit, but at the expense of detail and, possibly, contact. And it’s fun watching the players, theorbo and all – a suitably surreal touch for so ridiculous a spectacle.Handel, it’s been said, never revived Xerxes after its Haymarket run in 1738 because he never had to hand seven singers of adequate quality. This is some measure of Longborough’s achievement. For a start they have a pair of highly accomplished countertenors in Jake Arditti (Xerxes) and Tai Oney as his brother Arsamenes. On the opening night, Arditti began a shade tentatively and with uncertain tuning in “Ombra mai fu” but soon warmed up and ended with a dazzling account of his rage aria, “Crude furie”. Oney, a less assertive actor perhaps, sang with great elegance and fine control throughout.It’s a strong point of the production that the lead female roles emerge incisively contrasted. Alice Privett’s Romilda (pictured right with Tai Oney) – Xerxes’s amorous target – is tall, willowy, with sparkling coloratura and vivid colours in the voice; Abbi Temple, as her sister Atalanta, is short and bouncy, a polished comedian, compulsively watchable, smooth-voiced, and a fluent Handel stylist. As Xerxes’s wife Amastris, the mezzo-soprano Lucinda Stuart Grant is the least helped by her get-ups, which she has to change in mid-aria; but she, too, is well on top of her music.Mostly in Handel’s Italian operas the lower male voices get a fairly raw deal, but in Xerxes it’s marginally less raw than usual. Arsamenes’ servant Elviro, nicely played here by Matthew Durkan as a cleaner-cum-flower-seller, is a decent baritone role with important message-taking functions and some entertaining music. As the not very military general, Ariodate, Jon Stainsby still sounds a touch immature of voice, but will surely fill out into an excellent lyric baritone. Exactly where his battlefield triumphs fit into Jenny Miller’s seedy world of the mega rich is hard to say. But this probably wouldn’t have bothered Handel, so why should we care?",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/xerxes-longborough-opera,4
301,"Saul, Glyndebourne",Saul,Glyndebourne,2015-07-24,alexandra Coghlan,"I can’t remember a time I felt so profoundly disquieted by a Handel staging. It’s partly that, as an oratorio, Saul breaks so many dramatic rules that lend the operas their reassuring structural certainty, but there’s also something – a tenderness certainly, but also a violence – to Barrie Kosky’s production that uncouples the music from any residual cosiness England’s favourite adopted composer still inspires in British audiences. It’s unsettling and exhilarating in about equal measure, a startlingly sensitive and telling statement from a director better known for his dramatic shock-and-awe.If the Glyndebourne audience were braced for something provocative from Kosky on opening night then they were right, but for all the wrong reasons. Starting with an overture played straight, curtain down throughout, the Australian director puts the score first. Respectful but never reverent, this is a production whose interest lies in gaps exposed between score and staging, as well as the silences – defiantly and dangerously long at times – between musical statements.Establishing itself in the cracks of the drama, Kosky’s tale takes the familiar Bible story of David (fresh from victory of Goliath) and his unwitting overthrow of the maddened and tyrannical King Saul, and shades it in his signature moral greys. Innocence – Sophie Bevan’s Michal, even Iestyn Davies’s David – is up for debate, veering from giddy, inane glee to a coldness that speaks of more than a hint of repression in our hero: not perhaps the brave new ruler the final choral sequence would hope.But if morality is smudged and cloudy, the visual drama is anything but. The curtain rises on a spectacular tableau: a cornucopia of fruit and flowers, animal carcasses and stuffed peacocks, spread out before a chorus of wigged and painted Israelites. Part Peter Greenaway set, part Flemish Baroque still-life, it’s a gorgeous grotesque – a touchstone image for a production that’s all excess, exaggeration, extremity. Even more striking is the opening of Part II – a visual that drew spontaneous applause on opening night with its beauty and abundant camp. Otto Pichler’s idiosyncratic choreography brings designer Katrin Lea Tag’s bold designs to convulsive life throughout, with movements that are baroque by way of MTV.Saul may be among Handel’s finest oratorios, but it struggles with one of the poorest texts. Charles Jennens (he of Messiah fame) fails to find emotion or narrative drama in his convoluted phrases – “Such haughty beauties rather move aversion than engage our love” – suggesting a nation at war with its own civilisation, a people silenced by their abundant, empty language. It’s an issue Kosky makes a virtue of in his caricature Israelites – puppets animated by the motions of grief or joy, but oddly uninvolved. These he sets against the Lear-like figure of Christopher Purves’s Saul, an extraordinary piece of singing-acting that makes madness – unlovely, vulnerable, mercurial – poignantly human.The Cordelia and Goneril/Regan to Purves’ Lear, Bevan’s Michal and Lucy Crowe’s Merab point to a new generation shaped by their father’s madness, perhaps even sharing it. Singing of characteristic control and purity from Crowe chafes against her tempestuous anger, while Bevan makes the most of Kosky’s bleak vision for his heroine, turning her goodness and meekness into something rather more base. Vocally, however, it’s an impressive house debut and a match for Iestyn Davies’s exquisite David (pictured above with Bevan). There’s an unearthly quality to this voice that sets it effectively apart from all around it, but grounded in a muscularity that makes a credible warrior of a figure we first encounter bloodied and bruised from the fight. I’m not sure Kosky’s predictable take on the ""more than woman’s love"" between David and Jonathan (a rather uneven Paul Appleby) adds much, but it’s an effective means of curdling a pious tale into something more uncertain – an effect taken to extremes in Saul’s bizarre encounter with the Witch of Endor (John Graham-Hall). Those of a more sensitive disposition may want to look away at this point.The chorus, barely absent throughout, are the musical rock here. Handel’s extended fugal choruses don’t lend themselves naturally to memorisation, but by doing so the singers achieve a power few choirs could match. We move from overpowering volume to a hushed pianissimo, all minutely articulated and sensitive to conductor Ivor Bolton’s shading. It’s the final piece in a puzzle of a production that confronts and surprises but also moves – a serious and worthy successor to Glyndebourne’s fine repertoire of Handel stagings.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/saul-glyndebourne,4
302,"Lakmé, Opera Holland Park",Lakmé,Opera Holland Park,2015-07-10,David Nice,"Operatic hit parades have always been subject to fashion. For people of my parents’ generation, the famous number from Delibes’s Lakmé was the heroine’s coloratura Bell Song, immortalised at the movies by Lily Pons and Kathryn Grayson. Now it’s the Flower Duet, courtesy of British Airways. But there are other numbers equally worthy of attention in a glorious score stockpiled with the kind of thing the French call la mélodie eternelle. This is an opera that outside France has been in need of singers and a not too violent concept to do it justice.At Holland Park second time around – the company’s first production was in 2007 –  it gets the singers, and at the very highest level, but not the concept, or at least one that has any impact. For a start, how can you ignore the floral connotations – jasmine and lotus referenced early on, the datura blossom as the poison that the poor Indian girl uses to finish herself off at the end (no spoiler notice really needed; it’s 19th-century soprano-as-victim stuff as usual) – and not extend the gardens to the stage? The mind runs riot with wasted opportunities: a florist sponsor, scratch and sniff cards for the scents, perhaps, even a preliminary spliff or a foyer opium den to put you in the relaxed, go-with-the-flow mood this kind of entertainment requires.All we have, though, in Aylin Bozok’s production and Morgan Large’s austere design, is a gilded cage for the heroine and her temple-dancer spirit guide, and lighting vaguely suggestive of the blue waters along which she and her maid are supposed to float (why not go further with peacock colours to reflect the creatures crying so evocatively beyond the house?) Costumes might have brought colour by the yard, and on the cheap from Southall or East Ham, but these are astonishingly dull and, for Lakmé herself, distinctly unflattering. As for the action, there’s hardly any: the chorus, sounding good but looking zomboid, semaphores feebly from time to time, but not even the principals really interact so the movement rests entirely within the music.It could do with more drive from the otherwise expert baton of Matthew Waldren, conducting a very fine City of London Sinfonia with some first-rate wind solos and wacky timpani playing from Tristan Fry in the Act Two divertissement. This kind of audience especially is likely to get restless when the leisurely, Indian scene-setting first act runs straight into what feels like a long second (when would the interval arrive?). Delibes’s genius is, as Tchaikovsky put it of Bizet, for le joli, the pretty, and he often paints it in instrumental colours of selective delicacy – this work, no less than the much better known Pearl Fishers, is ideally a Glyndebourne opera.The singers set the bar high enough to suggest they’d grace that nonpareil of country-house opera. I’d mislabelled Fflur Wyn, so good in Handel and as Alice in Will Todd's site-specific opera for children returning to Holland Park later this month, as just a stylish light lyric; the voice now opens out gloriously whenever it goes up and over in Delibes’s more ecstatic phrases. Lakmé is only really a coloratura role in the celebrated highlight; leading up to it, the unaccompanied vocalise is here a model of bel canto, and the Bell Song itself has plenty of stylish trills as well as more of that opening-out which sets the seal of distinction on this performance. Joan Sutherland spoilt us for a fullness in the top E at the end, but Wyn (pictured above with Katie Bray's Mallika) just about carries that off, too.She is well matched with Robert Murray as her British army lover, Gérald. As with his excellent Frederick in the ENO Pirates of Penzance, the very top of his voice occasionally spreads a bit, but the middle range is absolutely golden, one of the loveliest tenor sounds around. It’s he who initiates the great tunes of the first two love duets, inspired material by any standards, and if the pair aren't directed to interact much - unhunch those shoulders, too, Mr Murray - they still fire vocally on all cylinders in tandem with the orchestra. I wish there was more for baritone Nicholas Lester to do as Gérald’s fellow officer Frédéric: the two men ought to have a decent duet in Act Three but Delibes, on less inspired form here, cops out.Still, Lester is virile of  voice and presence, a name to watch out for along with David Soar, a known quantity and the real bass article as Nilakantha, Brahmin vengeance seeker and Lakmé’s father. Katie Bray and Andrew Dickinson are fine as Lakmé’s servants, but why try to make them carry more of a subtext than their characters can take, and why does Hadji look like some kind of village idiot? Fiona Kimm makes what she can of an English governess with a terror of the “exotic”, adopting the distinct tones of a redoubtable former exponent, Monica Sinclair, and as her charges Maud Millar and Fleur de Bray sing sweetly enough (the British quintet pictured above).One last opportunity is thrown away by the production: we get the very flavoursome ballet music in Act Two, but you could hardly call what Lucy Starkey does to it choreography (her own, presumably). Perhaps it was wise not to make the Indian singing characters look Indian, but couldn’t a native Kathak or Kuchipudi dancer have been brought in to lend some flavour? Instead this supposed soul of the piece was as anaemic and nebulous as everything else in the staging. The best of recently-established British singers deserve much, much better.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/lakm%C3%A9-opera-holland-park,3
303,"Rigoletto, Longborough Festival",Rigoletto,Longborough Festival,2015-07-09,stephen Walsh,"The gable end of Martin Graham’s converted barn opera-house at Longborough is surmounted by statues of three composers: pride of place, not surprisingly, to Wagner – the festival’s raison d’être – and with Verdi and Mozart on either side. It’s true one approaches Italian opera here with somewhat less confidence than Wagner.  But it’s refreshing to have it at all, and the new Rigoletto, though patchy, has enough good points to make it worth the visit, if not the detour.Caroline Clegg’s production, it’s true, struggles to achieve the pace and tension that can always give Verdi the theatrical edge over Wagner. Given a small stage, she duly makes it smaller with a complicated arrangement of staircases and balconies (designer Lara Booth) that adapts well enough to the different settings but leaves too little room for manoeuvre. The opening party scene, relocated to the modern premises of Duke Sports Cars, is a decidedly flat, vulgar affair that makes moderate nonsense of the whole Monterone episode (including his condemnation to death in Act 2), not to mention everything to do with Rigoletto himself and his locked up daughter. In effect, it's Cosa Nostra without the ritual style.This Rigoletto's hunched back does look more like a slight stoop than anything seriously orthopaedicClegg also has a bad habit of having her characters stand around with nothing much to do, or simply facing the audience. But in the quartet, under-production is matched by over-production, with (the) Duke engaged in heavy petting with Maddalena’s amply displayed thighs, a somewhat basic reading of Verdi’s exquisite “Bella figlia dell’amore”. But then Rigoletto, for all its emotional and dramatic power, is tricky dramaturgically. How do you make the abduction as convincing visually as it is musically, on a shallow stage? How make the party go with a swing? These are spatial, choreographic problems which directors, for all their bright ideas, rarely solve.On the musical front things are a little livelier. Longborough have a potentially excellent Duke in Robyn Lyn Evans (who also sang a promising Rodolfo here a couple of years ago). He is a Welsh tenor with an easy, natural Verdi style, still inclined to semaphore his top Cs and a slightly wooden actor, but musicianly and highly listenable-to. I also like very much Martin Kronthaler’s Rigoletto, even if his hunched back does look more like a slight stoop than anything seriously orthopaedic. He has, it’s true, a tendency to drift intonationally in lyrical music; but he uses his voice powerfully in the all-important dramatic confrontations with the courtiers (alias henchmen), and he is touching in the final scene.Andrea Tweedale (pictured right with Martin Kronthaler) is an uneven Gilda, not yet wholly on top of the coloratura in “Caro nome” and also sometimes vague in intonation. The voice is certainly there, and needs only to develop more warmth and precision. But she deserves more sympathetic production, and the same goes, in spades, for Fiona MacDonald’s nicely sung Maddalena, and for some of the same reasons. One often feels that directors and designers never look at their cast when evolving their concepts and costumes. But this is a dangerous subject that I prefer, in the present context, not to investigate.The minor parts are well covered: Timothy Dawkins is a dry, suitably untrustworthy Sparafucile. Were there no honest men in Verdi’s Mantua (or for that matter Clegg’s Detroit)? Even Monterone (Howard Quilla Croft), presented here as a business rival, is probably a crook, though his dispatch still seems a bit unfair.Which leaves the conductor, Gad Kadosh, a palpably honest musician with no bumps and no excesses. He could perhaps let Verdi explode more, and he could move quicker in the finale. But he gives a generally sound, dependable reading of this marvellous score, a wonderful antidote to last month’s Tristan in case one were needed, which of course it isn’t. What an astonishing fact about Romantic music that it could produce two such utterly different masterpieces in the same decade and, partly, in the same city, Venice, where Wagner composed his second act a mere seven years after Rigoletto had its premiere at the Fenice.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/rigoletto-longborough-festival,3
304,"Falstaff, Royal Opera",Falstaff,Royal Opera,2015-07-07,David Nice,"It may only be a revival, but this is what the Royal Opera does best, above all in fielding a living legend of a Falstaff for Verdi's last masterpiece who’d probably be beyond the pockets of many other houses. Italian baritone, masterchef and filmstar Ambrogio Maestri is flanked by a good ensemble including two of the Jette Parker Young Artists Programme’s finest graduates, with top orchestral standards for Verdi's most elaborate score under the perfectly-pacing Danish conductor Michael Schønwandt, and a staging high on style, culminating in a dazzler of a final scene which is a return to good stagecraft after the fitfully clever, sometimes inept Guillaume Tell.One still gets the feeling that Robert Carsen, whose 2012 production is revived here by Christophe Gayral, wants everything to fit too closely together – that if he could he’d set the whole thing, rather than just four-and-a-bit scenes out of six, in a 1950s luxury hotel a long way from Windsor’s Garter Inn (“alla Giarrettiera” in Boito’s brilliant Shakespeare adaptation, rendered back into flavoursome English in the excellent surtitles). Bearing in mind this production also had to make its mark at the Met and La Scala – the ideal house for Falstaff’s fine-tuning is really Glyndebourne – Paul Steinberg’s massive wood panelling will do for a vast hotel bedroom covered in trolleys of leftover food and drink, the leifmotifs throughout, and for Falstaff’s clubroom reception of Mistress Quickly and jealous Ford disguised as a Yankee Brook (""Fontana"" in the Italian).The setting has to work a little harder to place the gaggles of conspiratorial women and men in the dining-room; although both tables are downstage left and right (Luis Gomes's Fenton and Anna Devin's Nannetta under one pictured right), the main players can be lost among the diners – an expensive number of actors - at least from the distance of a balcony seat. Why, you find yourself asking, would they constantly be getting up and leaving their places, and would the other guests tolerate all that pacing?  The logistics of the hunt don't work too well, either, if you take the timescheme too literally. Let’s just say Carsen expects us not to, but a degree of realism does rather encourage such questions.Verdi’s first scene, which can often feel a touch dry, kicks off superbly given the well-upholstered élan of the Royal Opera Orchestra under Schønwandt, Peter Hoare’s clarion Dr Caius and the short-tall duo of Bardolph and Pistol (Alasdair Elliott in better vocal shape than Lukas Jakobski, who still has work to do on technique). The minute Maestri opens his mouth you know you’re hearing a Falstaff of supreme baritonal beauty, the real Italianate thing – expansive in phrasing, effortless in the upper register and (crucially) relaxed enough in his big body to be genuinely funny. The “honour” monologue is a masterclass in how to combine lyric phrasing with minutely-observed musical theatre delivery. Later, more miniature set pieces come with a fabulous vaudeville routine (""Va, vecchio John"") and a very funny carving of two slices of roast chicken for Alice and the rest for himself (""Quand'ero paggio"")The merry wives with daughter and comic stooge in tow find the timing less easy; I don’t think it’s any fault of the hyper-alert Schønwandt, who likes to vary between featherlight precision and a more thoughtful, beautifully coloured vein, that on the first night the earlier ensembles weren’t quite spot on. Individually, two out of the four women are near ideal and one, Anna Devin as an especially determined Nannetta Ford, is superlative, floating every line with vivid sense of bel canto style and rising to the highest artistry in the Queen of the Fairies’ seriously beautiful song. Ainhoa Arteta’s glamorous if not vocally quite Italianate Alice Ford and Kai Rüütel’s fashion-plate Meg Page sport wonderful Fifties couture in the Act Two kitchen (pictured above), courtesy of the ever-inspired Brigitte Reifenstuehl, and convince us they’re having fun into the bargain; Agnes Zwierko’s Quickly gets plenty of laughs but hams up the over-reverent “female Mercury” delivering the deceptive messages to Falstaff and, though she certainly has the contralto extension, the voice swims in and out of focus.You have to feel a bit sorry for Roland Wood, a Ford one would be very happy to see under other circumstances but outshone by Maestri’s sheer baritonal quality and physical ease in their scene together; it’s Maestri's voice you really want to hear at the peak of Ford's jealous diatribe. Luis Gomes, like Devin schooled on the Young Artists Programme and quick to shine there, takes a bit of time to open out up top as stock lover Fenton, though he’s very sweet as a quirky waiter in the Garter Restaurant and the moonshine serenade of the final scene is a perfect preface to Devin’s even lovelier number.In fact everyone except Maestri, who's perfect throughout, saves the best until Verdi’s last, not least Carsen who, having pleased the simpler souls in the audience with a hay-munching horse in the stables where Falstaff is somewhat enigmatically sprawled after his dip in the Thames (Maestri pictured above with Louis), brings out his consummate gift for visual transformations in what’s usually the Windsor Forest scene.For a start, dry ice is usually the sign of a director’s impoverished imagination, but here it becomes a choreographed character threatening the horned Falstaff before a squadron of similarly-clad ""spirits"" turns the tables on the old lech, literally, with Nannetta as Queen. You can see the directorial cogs at work, wheeling on the trolleys so the production’s keynote of food can be fed into a knife-sharpening crowd of spooks preparing to eat the fatted calf as he rolls down the length of a deftly extended table. To steer everything to a happy meal at the end, Carsen continues to exert all his elegant tricks of movement and lighting – he's the co-designer in that field too – up to and including the dazzling, perfectly together fugal feast. The end crowns the work, and all is finally right in the beleaguered world of the Royal Opera as it rolls out a very classy end-of-season show.Next page: get a sense of Maestri's fabulous legato in the Prologue to Leoncavallo's Pagliacci.

305,"The Rape of Lucretia, Glyndebourne",The Rape of Lucretia,Glyndebourne,2015-07-06,stephen Walsh,"Britten’s first chamber opera is very much a Glyndebourne piece; its world premiere in the old festival theatre in July 1946 was also the festival’s inaugural post-war production. It brought into being the English Opera Group, and led soon afterwards to the foundation of the Aldeburgh Festival. So it’s good, in principle at least, to have it back on the main stage here, after an initial airing on tour in 2013. I say in principle, because in practice the work and its staging present so many problems that I can’t ever recall seeing a production without wincing with irritation. And this production by Fiona Shaw is no great exception.The problems begin with Ronald Duncan’s libretto, surely one of the wordiest and most pretentious ever offered by a serious writer to a great composer. Duncan for some reason saw the remote and minor tragedy of Lucretia’s rape by the Etruscan prince Tarquinius as a parable of invincible ignorance – sin committed in ignorance of Jesus Christ; and he installed a Chorus, one female, one male, to preface and interrupt the story in order to sermonise, Eliot-like, on this not obviously helpful topic.The device has the effect of turning the central action into a series of tableaux vivants. But worse than that, it patronises the characters disastrously, observing them like the cardboard figures in a peepshow. Alive to this danger, Shaw involves the pair more actively in the drama, even at one point implying some sexual engagement between them parallel to the eponymous rape. But even she can’t disguise the other gaucherie of Duncan’s text, his penchant for florid and impenetrable verbal conceits, put into the mouths of every character, aristocrat or servant, without the slightest regard for social or intellectual distinctions. When Lucretia’s maid urges us to “look how the energetic sun/Drags the sluggard dawn from bed”, or a rough Etruscan general enquires obscurely “what makes the Nubian disturb his heavy mountain?” one wonders whether Duncan had ever thought about the way people speak or the sorts of thing they say.Shaw’s production mostly survives these obstacles, taking a broadly naturalistic line between the static homilies. I like very much the chiaroscuro of Michael Levine’s simple raked set and Paul Anderson’s lighting, often suggestive of a Rembrandt or a Caravaggio. But the chief survivor is the music, not always Britten at his best perhaps, sometimes echoing Grimes in its formulae (not to mention its subject matter), but always exquisitely wrought, and with some intriguing new associations, especially Purcell and, after the rape itself, Bach. Leo Hussain conducts a chamber section of the LPO with real attention to Britten’s sharply imagined instrumental detail, and above all to the beautiful combinations he finds between individual instruments and individual voices. Whatever might happen onstage, this is a score – and a performance – that holds the ear.The same goes for the cast, the strongest imaginable. At its focus, Christine Rice is a finely poised, eloquent Lucretia, warm in colouring, intense in expression. But Kate Royal, as the Female Chorus, is hardly less impressive, and both she and her male counterpart, Allan Clayton (pictured with Royal), succeed in humanising roles that can be unbearably preachy and condescending. The three generals, Duncan Rock (Tarquinius), Matthew Rose (Collatinus) and Michael Sumuel (Junius) bounce around vigorously in their opening exchanges, becoming gradually more differentiated as the action unfolds.But the scenario, with all its moralising, leaves too little time for characterisation, just as the poetics blot out any serious portraiture in the female roles. Catherine Wyn-Rogers as the old nurse, Bianca, and Louise Alder as Lucia the maid are both excellent. But, amid all the stitching and linen-folding and flower-arranging (like the “embroidery in childhood” in Grimes), one never feels Britten was hugely interested in women, other than as targets for male villainy.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/rape-lucretia-glyndebourne,4
306,"Albert Herring, Britten Theatre, Royal College of Music",Albert Herring,Britten Theatre,2015-07-03,alexandra Coghlan,"Some of the best nights of opera to be had in London come courtesy of students. It’s not something we talk enough about, possibly because, with four major music colleges in the city, the quality is so high that the performers can (and are) judged as professionals. The Royal College of Music’s Albert Herring is up there with the best of them – an ensemble show bursting with character, detail, wit and an abundance of joy.Britten’s comic opera is blessed with one of the finest and funniest librettos – spoken character sketches as deft as the composer’s own musical caricatures. The combination is heady, especially when staged with such affectionate care as Liam Steel here musters, transforming the RCM’s Britten Theatre into a provincial Fifties fantasy, filled with ageing moral rectitude and youthful hijinks.Designed by Anna Fleischle, the Loxford church hall is a symphony of MDF, lino and enthusiastically patterned soft-furnishings – it’s all so familiar you can almost smell it (disinfectant, shoes and orange squash). But the real visual triumph is the Herrings’s shop, revealed on the other side of a cleverly deployed revolve. Posters of fat-cheeked children and smiling housewives frame rows of bright tins and boxes, and overflowing hessian sacks of produce squat round the walls – the pastel-bright innocence of a world in which a Lenten ride in a dog-cart with your cousin is enough to stain your character.Although performances alternate between two different casts, the constant across all nights of Albert Herring is the wonderful Janis Kelly, anchoring all around her as the magnificently unimpressed Lady Billows. She’d be luxury casting anywhere, but here she galvanises and energises her young co-stars, daring them to match her vivid vocal acting.Doing her bidding with barely repressed bitterness is Polly Leech’s Florence, gloriously glum and pruriently fascinated with the neighbourhood goings on. Leech’s is a thick, sensuous mezzo, and its richness chafes deliciously against her repressed pronouncements, hinting at hidden inadmissibles that are shared by most of the inhabitants in Steel’s picture-perfect community. All respectability in public, the mayor (beautifully sung by Joel Williams) attempts to solicit a young man on his way home, while Mrs Herring (Amy Lyddon) and even Lady Billows are exposed enjoying a strong addition to the fruit punch.Julien Van Mellaerts’s Mr Gedge seizes attention and simply won’t let go. There’s such detail in his oleaginous vicar, so ghastly-fond of Miss Wordsworth (a strong Natasha Day) that even in the crowded scenes of Act II he draws the eye, constantly inventive. He and Nicholas Morton’s Sid share the baritone laurels – Morton a charismatic and watchable presence, but Van Mellaerts perhaps just edging it for vocal colouring.So striking in the Handel Festival’s recent Giove in Argo, Angela Simkin makes a fine Nancy, all twirling high-ponytail and warmth, and together she and Morton (pictured left) deliver some of the loveliest musical moments of the evening. At the heart of the drama is Nick Pritchard’s Albert, a performance that plays the long game. Sweetly timid (aided by a splendid pink pinny) and vocally restrained throughout Act I, Pritchard displays tremendous control, holding plenty back for his drunken Act II release. His is a lovely English tenor with a core of muscularity that gives promise of a Clayton-esque future, and beautifully showcased here in Britten’s writing. Dramatically too this Albert is nicely judged, displaying no obvious camp beyond a brief exchange of glances with the leather-jacketed extra from West Side Story who haunts the shop. I won’t spoil the final tableau involving these two, but Steel judges it perfectly.The decision not to have surtitles works well for the most part, but it does mean that the denser ensembles (especially the fugue) lose their text, even in this small space. It’s the tiniest of quibbles though. When the singing is this good, and the orchestral lines as clearly articulated as they are here under Michael Rosewell’s direction, it’s of small consequence. Yes, there have been more than enough Albert Herrings already this year, but this is a show well worth exceeding the quota for.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/albert-herring-britten-theatre-royal-college-music,5
307,"Guillaume Tell, Royal Opera",Guillaume Tell,Royal Opera,2015-06-30,David Nice,"There are two operatic types who should leave Rossini’s epic swansong for the stage well alone. One would usually be a conductor who ignores many of the notes written by a master at the height of his powers, since even the least dramatic numbers have musical idiosyncrasy in them. Antonio Pappano still omits, among other things, Rossini’s superb Mozartian canon-trio for women's voices and wind ensemble; but what he does conduct is so focused and shapely that he must be forgiven. Not so his director, Damiano Michieletto, who not only jettisons a choreographer for the essential swathes of ballet music, slightly cut here, but also rejects the ties of landscape and community which are essential to the message of the opera, present them how you will.You know you’re in for the clichés of bad Regietheater when, against the storm music of the Overture, the lights go up on a clinical array of tables and chairs, the last to be spotlit the one on which young Jemmy Tell is playing soldiers and reading a comic book about the Swiss mythic hero. There’s a messy metatext in which the medieval figure comes to life and guides some of the action.Which is certainly not about celebrating an oppressed people’s pride in land and customs, since everyone is alienated from and angry with each other, not least the Tell family proper. Graham Vick, a director who made every note of what Rossini wrote work at Pesaro, has said that he believed most of all in the difficult, leisurely first act. Michieletto clearly doesn’t: there’s no wedding celebration in adverse circumstances, not a hint of lake or mountain, only gravel in which various characters grovel around, and a sapling pulled up at the end of a first act saved from tedium by Pappano’s pace and a few cuts.For the rest of the action, we’re left with a giant uprooted oak, which pointlessly revolves to reveal some good static tableaux. But why does would-be atmospheric lighting need to be helped by old-fashioned follow spots, and why throw away Rossini’s careful theatre of different musics for the men of three cantons in the famous scene of the oath on the Rütli? This waxwork show is about as interesting as Calixto Bieito’s ignoring Mozart’s three orchestras in the Act One finale of Don Giovanni in favour of a vague druggy jigging. And though the men of the Royal Opera chorus sing magnificently here – they got a bit out of synch last night in Act 4  – Pappano doesn’t fire on all cylinders here. Blood and bare chests at the curtain (pictured above) don't provide the necessary kick.Pappano finds the real fire later, along with John Osborn who makes convert to the Swiss cause Arnold's Act 4 “Asile héréditaire"" and its stonking cabaletta work with brilliant top Cs – the Ds are good too – and an unerring sense of style, even if Osborn isn't quite the clarion ideal. Malin Byström’s tone is unremittingly dark-hued as heroine-on-the-wrong-side Mathilde, but she too delivers the goods, while Gerald Finley, not ideally Italianate – yes, I know the opera is Guillaume, not Guglielmo, Tell, but it's still bel canto – in the great solo to his son ""Sois immobile"", projects energy and empathy even while pushed to over-emote like everyone else. Sofia Fomina, star of the Royal Opera's last revival of Ariadne auf Naxos (as a minor nymph!), is a game and bittersweet Jemmy, convincing as a bullied boy. Mezzo Enkelejda Shkosa and bass Alexander Vinogradov provide strong infill.No doubt Osborn (pictured right with Byström), getting the ecstatic applause notably absent up until then, was fired up by the boos and lingering audience noise ignited by an inept staging of the Act 3 ballet music. Feeble, yes, if not shocking or entirely gratuitous under the circumstances: instead of tyrant Gesler making the Swiss collective go through a humiliating national-dance fest for his Austrian officers – a divertissement done complete, Salò-style, and to huge applause at Pesaro by Vick’s choreographer Ron Howell  – Michieletto gives us an unchoreographed humiliation of a single woman fondled, stripped and about to be raped (it was that which set off the boos, I suspect, rather than the not very focused misalliance with the music).When I was writing for the short-lived Sunday Correspondent, the arts editor phoned me up the morning after Andrei Serban’s production of Prince Igor: “I hear there was booing at the Royal Opera last night. Is this a case for a ‘[Jeremy] Isaacs must go’ piece?” I muttered the usual line about good shows and bad, par for any opera-house season. In the case of the latest Director of Opera Kasper Holten’s record, I couldn’t even say that. Holten’s own good-in-parts Król Roger only went some way to redeeming his own overloaded Don Giovanni, Martin Kušej’s cliché-raddled Idomeneo and Katharina Thoma’s inert Ballo in maschera.Michieletto’s production is by no means as weak as that – it at least has energy, albeit excessive and misdirected – and he does end reflecting Pappano’s radiant handling of Rossini’s proto-Wagnerian new dawn. Surely it's time now not for reactionary playsafe, but for productions which at least reflect the original storyline of operatic drama from a new angle. This season the Royal Opera, Arts Council darling, has had a much poorer track record than the much-maligned, artistically sound ENO. No, the thoroughly collegial Holten shouldn’t go, but “could do better” is the verdict. Unfortunately we’re saddled with a Michieletto “Cav and Pag” next year.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/guillaume-tell-royal-opera,3
308,"Pappano's Classical Voices, BBC Four",Pappano's Classical Voices,BBC Four,2015-06-29,marina Vaizey,"Antonio Pappano, artistic director and chief conductor of the Royal Opera House, is a polymath, for he is also a brilliant and persuasive narrator of the history of music. Here he embarked on a four part history of the operatic voice, starting at the very top – or how to reach those high Cs, the Everest for the soprano.Often speaking beside a grand piano, on the grand and empty stage of the ROH, and thus subliminally reminding us that he first worked as a repetiteur before becoming one of the world’s leading conductors, he creatively interweaved vintage film of legendary performances and interviews of the soprano greats of the 20th century with his own conversations with sopranos now. Warming to his subject, Pappano explained that he started with the soprano as it is perhaps the most flexible range of all, lyrical, poetic, gutsy, dramatic. Yet the church because of St Paul banned women from singing in church, and the first soprano musical lines were of course sung by boys. But by the 16th century renaissance courts began to welcome professional women singers, and then came opera (Maria Callas, pictured below). In opera the soprano is conventionally long-suffering, usually dying, and plays roles ranging from fearsome warriors and feisty servant girls to murderous divas and scheming wives. And so to Verdi's Lady Macbeth, played by Anna Netrebko, who prepares by listening to 20 recorded versions of the role by other sopranos, taking and discarding as she absorbs what is possible, in order reach her own interpretation.Pappano reminds us that all seven billion people in the world possess one unique musical instrument, our voice, so how does it all work? The young soprano Anna Siminski sang the Queen of the Night from Mozart’s Magic Flute – high Cs and even Fs galore – from inside an MRI scanner so a consultant neurologist could show us the actual physical process of singing. Evidently the larynx, small as it is, has more muscles than any single organ, some 20 in all. The voice comes from the chest – and the head.Pappano paraded the extraordinary variety of mid-20th prima donnas – Birgit Nilsson, Wagnerian extraordinaire, yet adept at the most astonishing ornamentation in Puccini’s Turandot, was a farmer’s daughter from Sweden, and milked 10 cows on the day she also went off to audition for a place at the Swedish Royal Academy of Music. Leontyne Price was nurtured by her Methodist church and the support of her family in her segregated home town of Laurel, Mississippi; her leading role was that of the enslaved African princess in Verdi’s Aida.Renée Fleming revealed that as a student all she could think of was how to channel Leontyne Price’s miraculous high Cs. Joan Sutherland was a six-foot-tall Australian whose ambition was to sing at the ROH, although when she arrived in London after her six week voyage to England she failed her ROH auditions twice. Her nickname was La Stupenda, and she remarked that she did not know whether that applied to her size or her voice.And we saw the most astonishing phenomenon of all: filmed excerpts of Maria Callas as Tosca acting her heart out, trying to be quietly austere when being badgered by journalists, and simply saying that the way any artist should sing was simply to listen to the music, with your ears and your soul. One cannot help but wonder what she would think of some of the current excesses of directors’ opera today. She was also evidently not only an anxious personality off stage but an incredibly nervous performer. Sir John Tooley, a past chief executive of the ROH, remembered that his arm was black and blue after escorting Callas, she had clutched him so tightly.Back with the living, Pappano delved into the differences between vibrato and non-vibrato in Carolyn Sampson’s lament, Dowland’s ""In Darkness Let me Dwell"", not to mention her wickedly narcissistic turn as Handel’s Semele in the aria ""Myself I shall adore"" (Carolyn Sampson pictured above). The Dutch soprano Eva-Maria Westbroek told us of the role of her life, as Anna Nicole in Mark Anthony Turnage’s eponymous opera, a true story of classic operatic ingredients: a rise from nothing to wealth, a fall from grace, overwhelming loss and early death. And Pappano, with elegant impatience, has no truck with those who think opera elitist. Opera, he showed us, does what it has always done, laying bare the prejudices, assumptions and hypocrisies of the world around us.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/pappanos-classical-voices-bbc-four,5
309,"Death in Venice, Garsington Opera",Death in Venice,Garsington Opera,2015-06-22,David Nice,"Lagoon, miasma and scirocco may seem as far away as you can get from the rolling hills and pleasant airs of the Wormsley Estate in deepest home counties territory. Nor are the bleached bones of Britten’s bleak if ultimately transformative operatic swansong the usual culinary fare many punters might have expected to go with their fine wines and gourmet picnics. Against the odds director Paul Curran makes it all work, going about as deep, disturbing and ambiguous as the work allows while still serving a star performance in Paul Nilon’s Aschenbach and adding to the opera-ballet dimension that Britten originally envisaged in his tricky homage to Mann; at times you might have thought we were back in Rameau’s magical weave of dance and song.Stripped of most Venetian trimmings other than the billowing curtains of the Grand Hotel des Bains, lending their constant presence here as the chimerical barriers that cut off the protagonist from the real and unattainable worlds, and a distant view of Venice proper from the water, all focus is on the total isolation of Mann’s closeted writer with creative block and a desperate need for emancipation.What a remarkable opera this is when there’s no sung relationship of any meaningfulness, and none at all, as the Aschenbach of Myfanwy Piper’s risky libretto puts it, which is not one-sided. For a performance as heroic as Nilon’s (pictured right with William Dazeley as the Old Gondolier), my memory reaches back not as far as Peter Pears in distinguished later years, but to the beautiful phrasing of Anthony Rolfe Johnson and the searing intensity of Philip Langridge (both no longer with us, enriching and saddening the meditation on death). Nilon, whose Opera North performance as the dream-haunted hero of Martinů's Julietta left me longing to see him do much more in the Langridge line, combines both, but with a unique plangency. The quality is to the tenor world what Frederica von Stade’s uniquely larmoyante or tearful voice was among mezzos. The loneliness is heartbreaking, the disintegration into an abyss of desire terrible.From the start – a lone clarinet pulsing perhaps the arrhythmia of Britten’s own heart condition, Aschenbach’s mind beating on emptiness to a miraculous tissue touching on all 12 tones of the chromatic scale – you’re drawn into a strange inner world which Curran finds a phantasmagorical edge even in the rather arch genre scenes with their sometimes stilted interjections.It helps immensely that under the experienced guidance of Steuart Bedford, who conducted the world premiere at Snape Maltings on 16 June 1973, the instrumentalists are all there before us in the wondrously intimate Garsington pavilion as participants in the action. The woodwind, so close and direct, sometimes sound like John Adams’s synthesizer – in a good way – while the timpani cracks out the tattoos of the mysterious stranger manifest as a malign Dionysus to make the audience’s heart miss a beat or two. Cellos and basses scour the soul with flecks of a stunningly present harp (Sue Blair, dazzlingly to the fore); lean upper strings writhe in agony. It all hits home as I've never quite experienced it other than on the Decca recording conducted by Bedford with Pears as Aschenbach.The orchestral players' counterparts on stage are a flawless ensemble. 26 bright young singers prove equal to the annually legendary Glyndebourne team whether in choral paeans or in the multiple small roles of Venetians and hotel guests. Garsington's programme rightly highlights the promise of baritone Henry Manning, smoothly enunciating the news of cholera’s spread, and of tenor Joshua Owen Mills who makes his clarion mark as the Hotel Porter. There are 10 characterful dancers – two women (Nina Goldman as the Polish Mother, Georgie Rose Connolly as a Governess who reminds us that, yes, there is female desire going on here too), two children and five beautiful and/or sexy young men, dominated of course by the Tadzio of Celestin Boutin (the Games of Apollo pictured above).It’s always a slight difficulty adding years to Mann’s object of aesthetic admiration and desire (originally a pre-teenager, definitely on dodgy territory as indeed of course was Britten himself) to suit the musculature of an accomplished dancer. But Boutin passes muster better than any Tadzio I’ve seen, and as Curran clearly wishes, Andreas Heise’s choreography also ups the dance sequences to places where Britten wouldn’t necessarly have expected them, giving Tadzio a less passive role than usual. In seeing his adolescent yearnings, confusions and violence unfold, we’re reminded of Miles in The Turn of the Screw, confused by one side (governess and housekeeper) wanting him to be too innocent, the other (the ghosts) too depraved. Aschenbach’s part in all this, embracing elements of both, is ambiguous, but it does yield some astonishing scenes, not least the not-quite Pas de Deux before the broken declamation “I love you” at the end of Act One. Its desperately sad sequel, an alternative to the usual deckchair-slumping and beckoning spirit, plays out to the final transfiguration where Britten succeeds in offering his own uniquely spare version of Mahler's last three symphonic epilogues.Not all the music is quite on that level; the fatally ill composer, though composing the most frank operatic confessional of his life, was struggling, and might have made changes had he lived longer, not least to the rather bleached Games of Apollo. Heretically, I’d cut them, but I guess the Greek ideal needs a place here to counterbalance the much more masterly setting of Plato's dialogue between Socrates and Phaedrus towards the end. Though Tom Verney’s Apollo isn’t the most liquid of gods, the divertissement passes quickly, with the chorus reminding us of death’s presence as gilt-masked, black hooded Venetian carnival ghosts while the games go on among the boys. The jury’s still out on Piper’s exteriorizing, first-person translation of Mann revealing his protagonist’s inner workings; the best one can say of the monologues is that Nilon smooths over the well-intentioned embarrassments with his worried face and ever-present anxiety.William Dazeley’s handsomely-phrasing baritone has a dark colour right for the harbinger of death if not quite the low notes for, say, the Old Gondolier – this is a bass-baritone role written for the superlative John Shirley-Quirk - and he brings the right sinister quality to the falsettos of the creepy fop, hotel barber and leader of the travelling players. Curran adds the right dimension of Felliniesque outlandishness there (pictured above with Dazeley centre: definitely not the ""Honey Bun"" sequence from South Pacific), while observing all the symmetries between the acts, and he even makes the Dionysiac dream-orgy work, just. The blues of Kevin Knight’s skyscape always haunt, and Bruno Poet’s consummate lighting knows how to bleach them when disease, disorder and death beckon. And oh, that final not-quite consummation. If it works for you as it did for me, you won’t want any more Garsington badinage afterwards; best sit in the peony-rich formal garden for half an hour in meditative silence before the journey home.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/death-venice-garsington-opera,5
310,"La Traviata: Love, Death and Divas, BBC Two",La Traviata: Love,Death and Divas,2015-06-21,Adam Sweeting,"Verdi's La Traviata has become one of the best-loved and most-performed works in the operatic repertoire, but this is no thanks to sections of the English press. In this entertaining romp through the opera's history, presenters Tom Service and Amanda Vickery drooled over the juiciest bits from some of the reviews from La Traviata's London debut in 1856 – for instance The Times of London deplored ""an exhibition of harlotry upon the public stage"", adding that this was ""the poetry of the brothel"" – before splitting up to examine the musical and historical background of the piece.Once you'd got past the interminable potted preview of the film's contents, which included Service's comment that the opera ""caused a very British scandal"" – I wish Microsoft would hurry up and develop that platitude-checker – this opened out into an amusingly discursive adventure. Key excerpts from the score were performed with great intensity by soprano Gabriela Istoc as the consumptive courtesan-heroine Violetta, with tenor Edgaras Montvidas as Alfredo and Stephen Gadd, a very British baritone, as his disapproving father (pictured below). These were used to punctuate Vickery's investigations into how La Traviata clashed with Victorian attitudes to prostitution, and Service's exploration of Verdi's career and how he came to write the piece.Among the latter's key points were the way Verdi was able to avoid the suffocating embrace of the Catholic church to pursue a career in secular music, thanks to funding from the ""free thinkers"" in his hometown orchestra in Busseto, and the way his unmarried relationship with the soprano Giuseppina Strepponi was not only mildly scandalous, but fuelled his determination to create powerful drama about believable characters. ""Poetry with big, big balls"" as he apparently put it (in Italian, obviously).Vickery cheerfully confessed her ignorance about opera in general and La Traviata in particular, but having been to see it deemed herself amazed by its frank depiction of the courtesan trade and by its ""forensic examination of the female predicament"". However, she stopped short of echoing Julia Roberts's fantasy hooker in Pretty Woman, who declared that Traviata ""was so good I almost peed my pants"".Vickery illustrated her examination of the Victorians' obsession with prostitution, and their fear that it represented a terrifying moral contagion that would somehow bring down the British Empire, by showing us piteous contemporary paintings depicting the moral downfall inevitably caused by female infidelity. Her researches into the lifestyles of courtesans (they were ""the lionesses of the demi-monde"", of which Paris was the licentious epicentre) revealed oligarch-like opulence, funded by wealthy men who treated them as mere supplements to their varied portfolios. Marie Duplessis, the real-life model for Violetta, was so irresistible that she was enjoyed on a timeshare basis by a seven-man syndicate from the Paris Jockey Club. (Tom Service and Amanda Vickery, pictured below)Colourful as all this was, I still couldn't quite buy the notion of La Traviata rocking 1850s London to its foundations, despite guff from the presenters about the way it exposed rampant hypocrisy and misogyny in 19th-century Europe blah blah. As The Spectator put it in August 1856, in a piece not quoted in the programme, ""as far as the sympathies excited by the opera act at all upon practical life, this representation would give an entirely false notion of the actual character and condition of the class to which Violetta belongs, but of which she is not a representative."" In other words, while it may embody certain harsh or poignant truths, they're wrapped in scintillating melodies and bravura orchestration and enacted within the conventions of opera performance. It's art but also entertainment, and audiences flocked to see it. And still do. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-traviata-love-death-and-divas-bbc-two,4
311,"Samson et Dalila, Grange Park Opera",Samson et Dalila,Grange Park Opera,2015-06-21,Sebastian Scotney,"From “Printemps qui Commence“ (spring is beginning) to “Springtime for Hitler""... that really is quite some intellectual leap. Patrick Mason, an experienced and respected opera director, has uprooted the tale of Saint-Saëns's opera from biblical Gaza, and has placed the first two acts in France somewhere around the time of Jean Renoir's La Grande Illusion, with Warsaw ghetto overtones.He has then clearly transported the third act in the mid-to-late thirties, and laden those final scenes with overt references to the rise of the Nazis, complete with leadership cult, book-burning and the Hitlergruß. To support this political narrative, the word 'Prêtre' (priest) gets cunningly switched in the surtitles to ""Minister"". The final gratuitous deed then seems to land the action in the present day. Samson's destruction of the temple (spoiler alert) has him as a suicide bomber, defiantly brandishing sticks of explosive with which he will bring the edifice down.Grange Park Opera does have a continuing and, in the main, a highly successful tradition of bringing the French opera repertoire to life. It has gone with radical updatings before – from 2008, a crazily joyous Offenbach Barbe-Bleue, with harpoon-carrying deep-sea divers stand outs in particular. But this production of Samson et Dalila seemed to leave many questions unanswered. The original Bible-based story is well known, and on a first viewing, the emotionally charged material from another felt extraneous.These flaws in the conception was a disappointment, because musically, and with Gianluca Marcianò conducting, there was so much that felt completely right. The momentum of the musical action never flagged, and Marcianò was putting the case for a piece that is far more characterful, integrated, beautifully crafted and worthwhile than the reputation which precedes it. For a first night, we were on very firm musical footing indeed.Mason has also enabled the individual characters of the three principals to be very convincingly drawn. The American tenor Carl Tanner (pictured above), who has previously sung both the title role in Peter Grimes and Herman in The Queen of Spades at Grange Park, was in good voice and gave a strong account of Samson. Dalila is Sara Fulgoni's ninth role at the Hampshire opera house, and she was the characterful, knowing and experienced of his demise (pictured below right). Brazilian baritone Michel de Souza was a vocally commanding and convincing High Priest of Dagon.No praise can be too high for the work that Marcianò and repetiteur Patrick Milne have done with the chorus. They were remarkable throughout for their consistently bright, focused and balanced singing. In the intimate acoustic of Grange Park's theatre, you can feel that chorus sound as it hits you.There was a constant flow of musical revelations from Saint-Saëns's score. The held-chord writing for the woodwind section is demanding – but the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra's players rose to the challenge as one, giving the music all of the bloom, the clarity and the precision it required.A performance like this serves as a reminder that Saint-Saëns's reputation is rising. His sheer facility and expertise as composer, and the breadth of what he achieved are becoming better understood. Beyond his music, he was also an organist, a poet, and an erudite critic who wrote with robustness, elegance and clarity. A good recording of Les Barbares has just been issued. Advocacy from the distnguished 19th-century music specialist Hugh McDonald is likely to result in a book in the near future about all 12 of the French composer's operas. Grange Park has its compensations. It is, as ever, a magical and charming place to be, even on a day when the sky is full of dark clouds  – but the production doesn't quite add up.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/samson-et-dalila-grange-park-opera,3
312,"Tristan und Isolde, Longborough Festival",Tristan und Isolde,Longborough Festival,2015-06-17,stephen Walsh,"It’s well-known that Wagner shelved The Ring two thirds of the way through in favour of Tristan with the aim of producing something that could be put on quickly in a conventional theatre. Of course, it didn’t quite work out that way. Yet Tristan, for all its technical difficulties, does lend itself to a relatively small stage. Its ensemble scenes are few and manageable, and for the rest it’s basically a conversation piece. For the barn theatre at Longborough it presents no insuperable problems, and it’s no surprise that the summer festival there has come up with a wonderful performance to add to its successful Ring of two years ago.To get the best out of it, admittedly, one has to shut one’s eyes to one or two of Carmen Jakobi’s brighter production ideas. The rudimentary sets by Kimie Nakano, cleverly lit in chiaroscuro by Ben Ormerod, reflect well in their cool abstraction the essential stillness of the work’s exterior narrative. When left to themselves, the characters move and interact perfectly well in their standard issue Wagner tunics.Unfortunately Jakobi imposes on them a Jungian reading that requires Tristan and Isolde’s animus and anima to be embodied in a pair of dancers who sashay on and off, waving their arms and legs and occasionally fondling their alter egos, like spoilt children home from ballet class. What this adds to our understanding of Wagner’s fairly simple yarn I’ve no idea. But it does distract horribly from the music drama, often at its profoundest moments, like the A flat Act 2 duet or the later stages of Tristan’s delirium in Act 3. A certain hesitancy in Rachel Nicholls’s Isolde - this is no Hoffnungesque Wagner sopranoI was also baffled by the presence of the bass clarinettist onstage during King Mark’s Act 2 monologue. Another schoolkid showing off? For an instant, the king glared at her as if she were to blame for the entire mess-up; or perhaps he was merely wondering, like me, why she was there at all.While the kids are at school, though, all is fine. The small Longborough stage encourages a degree of intimacy in the direction, which turns out to suit Wagner surprisingly well. One feels close to the characters and senses refinements in the way they’re drawn: for instance, a certain hesitancy in Rachel Nicholls’s Isolde, a lingering reproach at Tristan’s initial unresponsiveness, and a youthfulness emphasised by her rather small stature and close-cropped hair. This is no Hoffnungesque Wagner soprano. Musically, too, she profits from the smallness of the space, has no need to over-sing, so can colour her voice to the changing moods. All in all hers is a beautiful, touching performance, faltering only momentarily in the Liebestod, though whether from weariness or failing concentration I’d hesitate to say.Peter Wedd’s Tristan (pictured right) is in almost every way superb: statuesque and chilly in the early scenes, pulsatingly emotional to the point of disintegration thereafter, but never losing control of his fine, slightly dry tenor. I’m largely immune to the rantings of the final act (and find its music, after the prelude, not much better than expert), but was riveted by Wedd’s musical portrait of deranged passion. The remaining cast are uniformly excellent: Frode Olsen an intense, vivid King Mark, wavering between bitter reproach and thwarted affection, Catherine Carby a strong, sisterly Brangaene, spinning a marvellous line from her watchtower, and Stuart Pendred a solid, dependable Kurwenal.But the biggest hero of the production is Anthony Negus, who shows yet again what a genuinely great Wagnerian he is. What kind of a system is it that can have consistently bypassed a conductor of this quality? Not only does he have a complete grasp of the broad Wagner rhetoric, but he has a wonderful ear for detail, something that comes out particularly in this small house, with – I guess – fewer strings, so that the woodwind and brass speak without blasting, and the voices come across without bellowing. The sheer sound of this performance – so far as I can tell uncut – is not the least of its many pleasures.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/tristan-und-isolde-longborough-festival,4
313,"Die Entführung aus dem Serail, Glyndebourne",Die Entführung aus dem Serail,Glyndebourne,2015-06-14,David Nice,"What a difference seven years can make to a budding genius. Mozart’s La finta giardiniera (1775) has only patches of brilliance, and last year’s Glyndebourne production, despite musical excellence, failed them all. This time an experienced director on best form, David McVicar, finds more nuanced humanity in the composer’s first mature German drama, Die Entführung aus dem Serail (The Abduction from the Seraglio, 1782) than I’d have believed possible, mirrored in the light and fire of Glyndebourne Music Director Robin Ticciati and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment. If you think Mozart’s orientalist rescue opera is stocked full of clichés, this is a deeply-felt show to make you think differently.Not that McVicar does anything radical – or perhaps it is, perversely, radical, to set the whole thing as envisaged in the court of a western-influenced 18th century pasha whose passions are architecture and gardening. The east-meets-west complexities are pointed up by the way in which hero Belmonte, despondent by a sparkling sea at the start, is beset by local hawkers and traders, only for the Ottoman potentate to be similarly petitioned by sellers of European landscapes and busts. It’s a nice touch, too, that we see an onstage cello as part of a seraglio string quartet while from the wings OAE woodwind play the sublime slow movement from Mozart’s B flat major Serenade, composed not long before Entführung.The names of designers Vicki Mortimer (sets and costumes) and Paule Constable (lighting) guarantee an atmospheric and malleable evocation. What a beautiful sight are enslaved Pedrillo’s and tyrannical servant Osmin’s little seraglio gardens, and what a shock it is to us horticulturalists when Osmin starts digging up and chopping about his hated western competitor’s efforts. In the first of many animated set-pieces, Tobias Kehrer sets the seal on a voice which the minute he’s opened his mouth from behind the palace windows we note with satisfaction is a true basso profundo.Kehrer, playing Osmin as wild man of the woods rather than calcularting sadist, is the vocal star – and since McVicar’s production goes for realism, then you could also argue that a gingerish-haired Turkish overseer could be a Laz from the Black Sea coast. Or maybe Pasha Selim brought him along from Europe en route for Turkey after the hero’s father dispossessed him in Oran (a back history revealed only towards the enlightened end of the opera). With so much more dialogue than we usually get, non-singing role Selim’s split between an urge to violent possession and a nobler renunciation comes across strongly. Franck Saurel (pictured above with Sally Matthews's Konstanze) sounded a little hoarse last night, but his charisma ensures that the scenes with Konstanze, the western woman he seems truly to love, fire at every moment.His presence also gives Sally Matthews something to react to in her enormous bravura aria “Martern aller arten”, every run and top note perfectly in place as they are throughout. Matthews’s technique, as has often been noted, is curious – slightly backward in placement, not always clear with the words and with a vibrato which, like that of her Belmonte (Edgaras Montvidas), sometimes stops a real Mozartian line from flowing. But the upper-register brilliance and stage presence make amends.Matthews and Montvidas - convincing as a handsome, haughty Spanish aristocrat (pictured left with Brenden Gunnell's Belmonte), an Almaviva in the making - are best together when, after a failed escape attempt, the lovers find themselves at Selim’s mercy. How is it that I’d remembered the Act Two Quartet as the last great number in the piece and thought there wasn't much to anticipate after the long supper interval when here, just before the reconciliation, is a duet which anticipates the love that transcends death in The Magic Flute? There are similar Masonic/universal sentiments which can still surprise when they're underlined as well as they are here (though Mozart didn’t join the fraternity until 1784, two years after Entführung’s premiere). McVicar gives these final stages (pictured below) such intensity that Mozart becomes the Shakespeare of Much Ado About Nothing’s potential tragedy.Not that the comedy is muted. Brenden Gunnell pours disciplined vitality into Pedrillo’s numbers, but the tour de force is Blonde’s kitchen spat with Osmin that kicks off Act Two in style. Mari Eriksmoen plays the spirited Englishwoman to the hilt, and you sense real emotional possibilities in the plate-smashing, egg-chucking quarrel with Kehrer’s endlessly coarse – and crucially likeable – Osmin. Ticciati is especially good at energising his music, strings flaring up and down the scale when they’re not trilling with delight. And though the dramaturgy of Mozart’s collaboration with Christoph Friedrich Bretzner and the enlightened topper-and-tailer Johann Gottlieb Stephanie Junior proceeds in fits and starts, this excellent ensemble makes us realize that no number is weak or generic. Entführung may not usually be anyone’s favourite Mozart, but Glyndebourne’s vintage evening might just make it so, if only for the duration.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/die-entf%C3%BChrung-aus-dem-serail-glyndebourne,4
314,"Don Giovanni, Royal Opera",Don Giovanni,Royal Opera,2015-06-13,alexandra Coghlan,"2013 was the year that pop fans were forced to ponder the ethics of “Blurred Lines”. In 2014 classical fans followed suit, when Kasper Holten’s Royal Opera Don Giovanni unapologetically redrew the map of sexual boundaries. Suddenly Donna Anna was sneaking off for a quickie with the Don while her beloved laboriously declaimed “Dalla sua pace” – a willing partner (along with Elvira, Zerlina and all other women to hand) rather than a victim. Now Holten’s Don returns, if not precisely a reformed character, then at least a changed one.It’s clear that the director has been doing some thinking since the production’s first outing, but what’s also clear is that he’s lost some of the courage of his earlier convictions. The action is softened, smoothed out, and while that makes for a more palatable evening of sexual politics, it also rather pulls the rug from under Holten’s concept.This is the tale as told by the Don himself (because white, male sexual predators are notoriously under-represented in art). As the Overture’s quavers start fidgeting, so the classical façade begins to swarm with scrawled names – the famous list of Don Giovanni’s conquests – until the building is blackly covered. Physical architecture is overwritten with sketches (animated by Luke Halls’s video designs), until the revolving cube of a world is one entirely created by Giovanni. He even leaves ink blots on the women, a black stain spreading outwards on Donna Anna’s dress (Albina Shagimuratova, pictured below) as the action progresses.This basic framework remains, but within Es Devlin’s rotating world much has changed. Though still an enthusiastic participant in the opening scene, Anna no longer continues to pursue the Don. This raises questions that fail to be answered by the fairly traditional character development that follows. Zerlina too, much less lusty in Julia Lezhneva’s hands here than Elizabeth Watts’s last year, is altogether more conventional.Most striking, however, is the rethink of the ending. Despite the confusion that came before it, this was a moment of shattering emotional rupture first time round. Stripped of his animated illusions and imaginings, the Don was left alone in the full glare of stage and house lights, suddenly thrust back to truth, while offstage the ensemble sang the sextet. It was elegant and satisfying in a way that few productions of this opera achieve. Traditionalists may prefer Holten’s current thinking, which follows the well-trodden route of cutting the final scene altogether, simply condemning Giovanni to an ever-shrinking spotlight and the curtain, but it makes little sense in the context of what comes before.The big draw for this first revival is a starry cast, led by Christopher Maltman’s Don (pictured below with Lezhneva as Zerlina). Where Mariusz Kwiecien was all about sex, Maltman’s seductions are all about power, control. Cold violence in his actions meets heat in the voice, pouring itself into every crack in this familiar role. It’s a shame he and the rest of the cast don’t get more support from Alain Altinoglu’s pit. Veering all over the place in tempos that push and rush, and at one stage on opening night left the onstage band almost a beat behind, Altinoglu brings propulsion but little sensitivity, and the fortepiano still draws far too much attention to itself in the recits.Of the women, it’s Dorothea Röschmann’s Elvira that seizes this limp production by the balls – urgent, desperate, at times exquisitely unlovely, deploying every vocal colour and quirk of phrasing with intent. Albina Shagimuratova’s Donna Anna offers strong support, though noticeably tires towards the end, a more natural fit for this space than Julia Lezhneva (Zerlina). This voice is still – and may always be – a bit too small for Covent Garden, and especially in this low-lying role, her lack of power exposed in wayward tuning and unbalanced ensembles.While the rest of the cast were booked for Mozart, Rolando Villazón (Don Ottavio) spent Act I convinced he was doing bel canto, swooping and crooning his way through a troubled “Dalla sua pace”. This voice is still not a healthy one, and it's hard to see a future when everything above the stave retreats so far into the nose. Things improved with “Il Mio Tesoro”, and despite his issues, Villazón’s innate star quality does make this drip of a romantic lead into a more plausible lover than most.If Holten’s Don Giovanni still isn’t precisely a success, then it does remain a fascinating failure. There is so much – too much – thought here, but plenty to provoke and engage. What’s lacking, however, is desire. Sex, here, is power, control, social currency. What it isn’t, and really needs to be, is sexy.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/don-giovanni-royal-opera-1,3
315,"Flight, Opera Holland Park",Flight,Opera Holland Park,2015-06-11,alexandra Coghlan,"Connections are missed and made in Jonathan Dove’s Flight – a giddy airport fantasy of what might be and what never was. Not yet 20 years old, this contemporary score is quite a departure from Opera Holland Park’s staple fare of well-aged verismo and bloodily rare Italian drama, but in a glossy new production by Stephen Barlow it pulses with all the same urgency and human interest – and not a suicide/secret pregnancy/long-lost parent in sight.Driven by propulsive motor rhythms and percussion ticks, Dove’s score has the same slick statelessness as Andrew Riley’s designs. Here a bit of Copland (alright, a lot of Copland), there some Ravel, a bit of bel canto funny business and a handful of Mozartian ensembles, and you’ve got music that has no right to sound as idiomatic and coherent as it does. The opera’s unity of place – confined within the airport terminal – helps anchor its more diffuse elements, and Opera Holland Park’s broad stage space comes into its own for a piece that keeps so many of its cast on stage for so much of the evening.The conceit is simple: trapped in the airport by an electrical storm, a disparate group of travellers (warring couple hoping to rekindle their love, a single lady of a certain age hoping to meet her much younger lover, a diplomat and his wife) find themselves thrown together with a refugee, kept there by his lack of papers, two over-sexed flight attendants and the glacial airport Controller, watching over all from her panoptic glass tower.Though a little too gleefully glib at times, April de Angelis’s libretto pulls off a trick few contemporary operas achieve. What sets out as a sunny social comedy (genuinely funny, for once) morphs in the opera’s closing moments into something altogether more tender and expansive – a shift all the more potent for Dove’s lyrical restraint up until this point. Unbending briefly for an exquisite aria for the Minskwoman (sung with such simple intensity by Victoria Simmonds), Dove otherwise keeps his melodic cards close to his chest, preferring to drive his action with deft ensembles and breathtakingly intricate layered writing that sees stories and vocal lines weave in and out of one another more neatly than the crowds in any departure lounge I’ve ever seen.Archetypes become a loveable (and laughable) group of people thanks to a superb ensemble cast – surely among the finest we’ve heard recently at OHP. Lucy Schaufer’s older woman is by turns brittle and complicated, incontinent with emotion and affection, her loneliness set against the Steward and Stewardess (George von Bergen and Kitty Whately), caught up in the banality of lust – “You have identical eyes”/“You have thighs” – but better at the “straying” than the “staying”. Their comedic energy ripples outwards through the cast, energising Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts and Ellie Laugharne’s bickering couple and drawing them into one of opera’s more unexpected comic denouements.All of this operatic chatter might sustain a one-acter, but giving Flight full-length heft are the twin figures of the Controller (Jennifer France) and Refugee (James Laing, pictured below left with Ellie Laugharne). Set apart from the action – she by some stratospheric writing, he by that otherness the countertenor voice still suggests – they tell a tougher and more halting story. Things are lost as well as found in this liminal space, and in the glassy purity of the Controller’s hermetically-sealed soundworld and the Refugee’s own – texturally alien, folk-simple in delivery – we feel the voids.Laing gets better with every passing season, but this is a role that suits him especially well, showcasing not only his growing power but also his presence – carrying, almost alone, the opera’s closing twist of the dramatic knife. France too is glossily secure, filling this tricky tented space with a pealing tone that matches the gilded brilliance of Dove’s writing for tuned percussion and brass. Brad Cohen directs the City of London Sinfonia (on stonking form) with sensitivity both to the composer’s moments of quasi-Broadway release and his matter-of-fact dramatic patter, revelling in Dove’s colourful and meticulously characterised orchestral writing.There aren’t many performances left of Flight, so grab a ticket and take this first-class operatic trip while you still have a chance. Opera Holland Park have done the opera proud with this, its first professional London staging, edging Dove’s piece ever closer to that elusive status of “contemporary classic”.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/flight-opera-holland-park,4
316,"A Country Doctor, Phaedra, Guildhall School of Music and Drama",A Country Doctor,Phaedra,2015-06-10,Peter Quantrill,"Of the two works by Hans Werner Henze on this curious if ultimately satisfying double-bill, neither quite answers to the name of opera. Henze originally conceived The Country Doctor as a radio opera, that still-rare and unfairly maligned genre, which allowed him to set the whole text as Kafka wrote it, with the doctor a disembodied voice at front and centre, a neutral observer of his own mental disintegration while the imagined events of his long dark night of the soul work their horror around him. The stage adaptation Henze wrought in 1964 was really a vehicle for the gifts of Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, which perhaps he came to acknowledge three decades later by making one final revision that gives the subsidiary characters their own voices back.If Martin Hässler was intimidated by the shoes he was filling or the scale of the challenge, he never showed it. With restrained, naturalistic movement around a simple set, he misplaced not a word of a part that continually shifts from recitative to Sprechstimme to arioso and back again. The simple set by Claudia Chisholm places the doctor in his own study but moves Kafka to the centre of the action by projecting the text onto the back wall: the doctor may have eventually made it home – if he ever left – rather than being lost amid the snow, but his mind is forever wandering a Winterreise landscape between nightmare, madness and the grim reality of a life accepted with the fatalism of the boy whose death he is powerless to prevent.To Phaedra Henze gives his most testing coloratura, and Mainwaring sails through it without chewing the sceneryWho is telling the tale, and at what distance? How reliable are they? Henze often returned to such narrative ambiguity, though mostly with sardonic enjoyment of an audience’s discomfiture, as in tragi-comic denouements of The Young Lord and The English Cat. Phaedra moves from an alienated retelling of the Euripidean legend into quasi-mystical contemplation that may have prompted the billing of ""concert opera"": interrupted by a serious health scare, it was to be his final dramatic work. The libretto (fashioned in high-literary style by Christian Lehnert, and sympathetically translated in the surtitles) moves freely across time and space, and so does Ashley Dean’s staging. The gods who take sides for Phaedra and her stepson Hippolytus are humanised to create complex, four-handed interactions and undermine the stereotype of us as Lear’s ""wanton flies"".Over more than half a century, Henze’s own style evolved from the dodecaphonic patter of The Country Doctor to a dense synthesis in Phaedra of Italianate vocal writing and unrelenting post-expressionist harmony lifted here and there by memories of himself in neoclassically Stravinskian humour. Even the scoring for a 23-piece band doesn’t bridge the gap between the styles, though Timothy Redmond’s conducting was discreetly effective and nurtured some delicate playing from the pit-band. In every respect the production values offered more than might be expected of even specialised, accomplished students. The countertenor of Meili Li (as Artemis, protector/tress of Hippolytus) is as yet small but well-formed, and Rick Zwart’s brief solo as the Minotaur revealed a baritone hardly less even and ingratiating than Hässler’s (the two singers swop roles later in the run).Lawrence Thackeray nicely captured the paradox of Hippolytus as a powerful victim, though he didn’t sound at ease with some of Henze’s more heroic tenor gestures, and the final image of him, lost and weak, somewhere between life and death, sensitively brought Henze himself into the drama. Laura Ruhi-Vidal was a winningly capricious Aphrodite, but the most eye- and ear-catching stage presence was Ailsa Mainwaring in the central role, alternately scornful and rejected, a woman like Kundry who hardly understands her own power (not the only Parsifalian allusion in either the piece or the production, thanks to the ingenious magic garden of Dan Shorten’s video designs). To Phaedra Henze gives his most testing coloratura, and Mainwaring sailed through it without chewing the scenery in a performance that comes to grips with Henze’s Verdian heritage.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/country-doctor-phaedra-guildhall-school-music-and-drama,4
317,"Intermezzo, Garsington Opera",Intermezzo,Garsington Opera,2015-06-07,David Nice,"In a curious deal, two operatic card games were running almost simultaneously last night. At the London Coliseum, Tchaikovsky’s outsider Hermann was gambling for his life on three hands of Faro in The Queen of Spades, while in home counties countryside, Robert Storch aka Richard Strauss thought he was relaxing from a performance with a nice game of Skat when in comes a telegram from his tricky spouse Christine, aka Pauline Strauss, unsigned as usual, accusing him of adultery.The Skat game (pictured below) is probably the first thing opera lovers who haven’t seen or heard it know about Intermezzo, one of Strauss’s rarer if by no means neglected operas. The second is that it’s supposed to offer up a portrait of the Wife from Hell. That image was dispelled at Glyndebourne by the charm and nuance of Elisabeth Söderström and Felicity Lott, while among recent characterisations Anita Bader at Scottish Opera has carried on the good work of underlining Christine’s lovely soul. When, as at Garsington, not enough along those lines transpires, given the conjunction of a not overly charismatic heroine and an under-detailed production, all sorts of questions flood in about the work itself.Why, for instance, is Christine only ever seen from a male perspective? Why did Strauss himself, in crafting an anecdote from his own married life about a case of mistaken identity which nearly led to catastrophe, insert so much of what was said about Pauline, and how she clearly was both on the surface and deep down, and omit a very salient point: that she withdrew from a career as a highly-praised soprano who’d sung Isolde, no less, to raise a child and play the helpmate to one of the world’s most successful musicians? Would that not have provided some motivation for her seething discontent?Without it, this woman who spends a great percentage of a very lengthy role needling people can seem like a nightmare. Especially when the soprano-actress seems too placid to suggest the nervous volatility which drives Christine’s more unfortunate aspect. At Garsington there was danger of the same misconception which once led a distinguished critic who should have known better to describe the Marschallin in Der Rosenkavalier as a “tight-lipped bitch”.Admittedly Mary Dunleavy was the third singer Garsington engaged for the role. There was well-placed confidence that she knew the part inside out, having sung it for the ill-starred New York City Opera. Vocally she’s more of a light lyric soprano, a Sophie, than an opulent, multi-coloured Marschallin or Ariadne, but she can negotiate the relatively few soaring phrases – most of them towards the end of the opera – very impressively indeed. But she’s no comedienne, and since director Bruno Ravella didn’t seem to have worked on the projection and timing of the crucial spoken dialogue which should flow in and out of the quicksilver score, lines and situations which should have been both funny and real fell flat.That it wasn’t entirely Dunleavy’s fault showed in the parallel scene where Storch, having spent three sleepless nights away in Vienna tormented by the incomprehensibility of his wife’s accusation, finds out that the mysterious telegram sent to him by a lady of doubtful reputation was meant for colleague Stroh (in real life the future New York based conductor Stransky; the actual message seems in any case to have been relatively uncompromising). Mark Stone, possessed of a full baritone voice which, in Garsington at least, is too loud too often, hardly seemed “close to madness”, as Storch claimed, just a bit of a smug bully to his unfortunate colleague - a beautifully etched vignette by promising tenor Oliver Johnston, one of four young singers who made the Act Two card game so sharp, witty and focused.Other supporting roles are flawlessly taken. Sam Furness does a perfect comedy turn as the not very bright young fop Baron Lummer (pictured below on the ski slopes with Donleavy), a foil to Christine's more generous and vulnerable side, and Ailish Tynan with her lovable mug is pitch-perfect as the long-suffering maid Anna  (pictured above reading the telegram in the group on the right; Garsington could have taken a risk and engaged her as possibly a more charismatic Christine).Psychologically, the production is most impressive when it catches its couple – and their son, more than usually messed up in young Louis Hynes’ impressively distraught performance – frozen in bleakness; otherwise they're mired in narcissism (the libretto is always about what the one half of the couple needs from the other, rarely about each of them as their own person). I’m not sure that Christine needs to be quite so tragic in the opera’s deepest music, the wonderful Act One interlude which is Strauss’s finest slow-movement tribute to his wife, but Dunleavy held the trauma and – in marked contrast to Intermezzo’s last outing at the old Garsington, as vulgar as this staging was lukewarm, where David Fielding had business breaking into the interlude – let the music play out to freeze-frame.Conductor Jac von Steen could have afforded to give a bit more space to the opera's true heart, and the otherwise reliable brass were having a few bad moments here. Clearly, though, the incisive Dutchman's work on co-ordination between singers and orchestra was more miraculous than most of the audience could have realized, given the chattery nature of the realistic scenes themselves (the interludes offer the only expansion of inner feeling until the final duet). One of the many beauties of the superlative, if (last night) chilly, Garsington Pavilion is the clarity with which the woodwind writing emerges – as essential for Strauss as it was last year for Janáček – and the lovely open stage space is in welcome proximity to the very comfortably and spaciously seated audience, a real privilege. Giles Cadle’s clean-lined set, basically the Villa Strauss subject to transformation into toboggan run, inn, Prater and various rooms elsewhere, offered the bonus of elegant scene-changes minimally affecting the marvellous orchestral interludes – no need for the usual drop-curtain.It was just a pity that Ravella couldn’t find more precise detail to fill every scene. The “Bahn frei” whizzes down the slope didn’t happen on cue, and the waltz sequence at the Grundlsee looked badly in need of a choreographer (none credited). My guest, unfamiliar with the opera, found the final duet a “schlockfest”; good as the late, lamented Andrew Porter’s English translation may be, it uncomfortably underlines how the sentiments that a wife might like a bit of violence from a placid husband once in a while and will revert to obeying him in everything are so retrogressive for 1924. And Ravella crowned that with a final tableau where the couple, instead of heading for the bedroom, emerge on the balcony as old Richard and Pauline, looking into the sunset of the Four Last Songs’ “Im Abendrot”. It should have been heart-warming; it just seemed like the final complacency closing the lid on a very questionable relationship.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/intermezzo-garsington-opera,3
318,"The Queen of Spades, English National Opera",The Queen of Spades,English National Opera,2015-06-07,alexandra Coghlan,"The delicacy of its supernatural elements make Pushkin’s The Queen of Spades, as adapted by Tchaikovsky, a tricky proposition for any director. Do you go with the ghost story and risk losing your audience emotionally, or do you play it straight, trying to rationalise the plot’s moments of macabre? The hands of the clock stand perpetually arrested just moments before midnight in David Alden’s new production for ENO, putting his audience out of any doubt as to which he has chosen.Setting the opera in hospital or mental institution is not a new idea, but one that serves Alden well in a large-scale spectacular only outdone by the recent Mastersingers for sheer visual volume. If the first half ticks with far too many of the director’s favourite theatrical motifs, cramming so much stage-business in that it’s hard to pick out the important from the merely decorative, the second brings a much leaner approach that finally allows some of the psychology at the core of all this posturing to come to the fore.Pucci-clad Sixties lovelies, animal-suited revellers, a bewigged 18th-century footman (wearing sunglasses), military personnel and decaying classical architecture all come together in the fantasy of Hermann’s very troubled mind. If there’s a logic to why he and his beloved Lisa (Peter Hoare and Giselle Allen) seem to exist in the 1940s, Masha (Katie Bird) in the 1920s and Pauline’s friends in the 1960s then it’s not immediately evident. Once you surrender to Alden’s imagination and stop trying to find a thread through this visual labyrinth everything gets that much easier.At the chilly, unbeating heart of this production is Felicity Palmer’s astonishing Countess (main picture, with Peter Hoare's Hermann). After a first half spent doing her best operatic impression of Maggie Smith’s Dowager Countess, frail and childlike in her nightwear, she barely occupies the chair, placed alone, centre-stage at the start of Part II. After the chattering chaos of the ball and its (inevitable) orgiastic goings-on all is suddenly very still, allowing Palmer to seize the space and deliver her “Je crains de lui parler” with shattering intensity. There’s still a beauty to Palmer’s voice, unused in recent outings as Mrs Sedley in ENO’s fine Peter Grimes, that she deploys to devastating effect in the pianissimo sweetness of the repeat – its loveliness contrasting cruelly with the horrible shell of the woman and her imminent death. This is an exemplary, extraordinary performance.Peter Hoare’s Hermann is less straightforward. Struggling vocally to find his feet at the start he seemed overfaced by the relentless demands of the role, but grew as the evening progressed, creating a hero convincingly at his mental extremity. There’s a reedy muscularity to Hoare’s voice that we heard at its dramatic best in ENO’s The Damnation of Faust, that plays well here off Tchaikovsky’s plangent orchestration, with its prominent writing for oboe. If it lacks a certain fullness and roundness then that’s a musical lack almost compensated for by the edgy dramatic quality it lends the action.Edgy things may be, but passionate they are not. Hoare’s interplay with Allen’s Lisa lacks even the hint of a spark, despite Gardner’s swift, driving energy from the pit – he discovers more chemistry with Palmer in their ill-fated encounter. Though Allen delivers the role with all the gestures and vocal architecture you’d want, it’s strangely uninvolving. Distractingly good, however, is Catherine Young’s Pauline (pictured left) – drunkenly tragic in her aria and full-Broadway vampish in the Intermezzo. There’s also strong support from Katie Bird’s bright-toned Masha and Nicholas Pallesen’s dignified Yeletsky.This Queen of Spades marks Edward Gardener’s departure as ENO’s musical director. His legacy to the company is great, but in nothing greater than the power and colour the chorus have acquired during his tenure. This production, massive with additional singers, is a superb homage to him, relying on this crack team of musicians to carry an evening that, for all its successes, is still laden with too many ideas and not enough feelings.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/queen-spades-english-national-opera,4
319,"Fiddler on the Roof, Grange Park Opera",Fiddler on the Roof,Grange Park Opera,2015-06-05,Kimon Daltas,"Many matches are made in Fiddler on the Roof but the matchmaking prize goes to Grange Park Opera for getting Bryn Terfel to take on the role of Tevye. Having only recently played Sweeney Todd, and indeed throughout a varied career, Terfel has proved that he can treat lighter music with respect and sincerity, not to mention plenty of good humour. He is superb as the beleaguered paterfamilias, intoning aphorisms at his family, god and anyone who’ll listen with more than a nod towards the cinematic Tevye which made a household name of Chaim Topol – who was actually in the audience on opening night.With Terfel in the bag, Grange Park had a choice – should the rest of the cast be opera singers as well, trusted to tone it down a little and do a bit of an accent? As it happens, no: though the chorus is operatic (the same group will be on for Eugene Onegin later in the summer), the named parts are taken by musical theatre singers or actors who can sing. And talking of accents: they can’t seem to agree on one. It's refreshing, however, that they sing unamplified (no West End headaches) and Terfel is sensitive enough a singer to rein in his mighty instrument when needed. In fact the Act Two duet ""Do You Love Me?"", with Janet Fullerlove as Golde, is somehow more moving for the fact that Terfel/Tevye chooses to let her be heard. It works.On the other hand, the sheer vocal muscle of the opening number ""Tradition"" (mainly Terfel and chorus) perhaps creates an expectation which isn’t lived up to. On the other hand, as Tevye would say, it is a committed and enjoyable cast, with Charlotte Harwood, Katie Hall and Molly Lynch as the older daughters, Anthony Flaum and Jordan Pollard as the main love interests, Rebecca Wheatley as the matchmaker Yente and Cameron Blakely as Lazar Wolf.The production itself is faithful to the atmosphere of the film, and director/designer Antony McDonald does wonders with fairly basic staging to create all the different indoor and outdoor spaces with speedy scene changes. He is well served by Gabrielle Dalton’s costumes and Lucy Carter’s lighting. There are various intricately worked out numbers with dozens of people on stage, including an impressive dance troupe, which run naturally and exuberantly – and presumably hide many hours of rigorous rehearsal. Tevye’s dream is a particular delight.The BBC Concert Orchestra conducted by David Charles Abell is a luxury pit band indeed, augmented with touches of Klezmer clarinet and accordion, and of course an onstage fiddler.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/fiddler-roof-grange-park-opera,4
320,"Pelléas et Mélisande, Welsh National Opera",Pelléas et Mélisande,Welsh National Opera,2015-05-30,stephen Walsh,"Debussy completed only one opera (though he started plenty), but it’s the most perfect work imaginable, not only in sheer musical refinement and narrative precision, but in psychological penetration and above all in that exact grasp of the irrational nature of the medium that distinguishes the greatest operas from the merely effective. Maeterlinck’s Pelléas et Mélisande is a sometimes uneasy blend of the mundane and the mysterious, but Debussy – in his quite faithful operatic version – fuses these two elements so successfully, through his music, that the distinction ceases to matter. His Pelléas is a completely self-contained world, an island where things happen. And it’s one of the many virtues of David Pountney’s brilliant new staging for WNO that it buys into this integration in a positive, inventive way, without looking for disruptive or alienating factors.I hardly know where to begin in praising this production. But let’s start with the music. Pelléas is an 1890s work, composed in the shadow of Wagner (especially Parsifal but also Tristan), but also under the influence of the French symbolist poets Baudelaire and Verlaine, and, through them, Edgar Allan Poe. The music has a decidedly un-Wagnerian delicacy – even if, as I think, Wagner is underrated in this respect. But because Debussy concentrates an intense symbolic feeling into succinct, elliptical figures, the music calls for a kind of accuracy of timing and colouring that is perhaps less necessary in Wagner’s sweeping paragraphs.Koenigs is superb at feeling this togetherness of the voice and the orchestraFrom the very start, Lothar Koenigs (also a great Wagnerian) hits this target of locating every detail in musical space, not just in the supremely atmospheric prelude (taken quite slowly), but throughout the early scenes, where Debussy is busy defining the apparently incoherent universe in which these helpless characters battle with, or mostly submit to, their destiny. I’ve rarely heard orchestral playing of such angelic perfection, such faultless balance and timing. Debussy took from Wagner the idea of the orchestra carrying the drama, but from Musorgsky the concept of the word setting as an ideal conversation; and he brought the two together. Koenigs is superb at feeling this togetherness of the voice and the orchestra; and, in this deceptively tricky music, there is no trace of unease or disagreement between the stage and the pit. One might be listening to the work as Debussy heard it in his head. I can’t think of any higher praise.The cast is on this level. The Mélisande, Jurgita Adamonyte (pictured right with Jacques Imbrailo), got the biggest applause, and she is indeed exquisite, with the right French timbre, slightly edgy, a light top, but reserves of warmth as well. But Jacques Imbrailo, as Pelléas, is as good, managing a proper bariton Martin – a light, high baritone, Debussy’s own voice, we’re told – and a marvellous vocal portrait of fragile, astonished passion, a passion that rescues a weak personage from insignificance. The heavier baritone of Pelléas’s half-brother Golaud is finely taken by Christopher Purves, capturing with horrible conviction the violent bewilderment of a good but unsubtle man confronted, like Wagner’s King Mark, with an emotion outside his comprehension. And there is excellent support from Scott Wilde as Arkel, Leah-Marian Jones as Geneviève, and Rebecca Bottone as the boy Yniold – vocally, at least, though she has trouble with the boyishness.The production uses a modified version of the set originally created by the late Johan Engels for the company’s Lulu in 2013: a huge metal lattice-work that doubles well enough as a dark forest or the mysterious depths of an ancient castle, but mostly stands for the mental disorder of its inhabitants, not to mention their curiously misaligned relationships – as if half-brotherhood and step-motherhood were a recipe for psychological confusion, as perhaps they are. The effect of the stage picture is transformed by the lighting designer Mark Jonathan’s brilliant polyphony of darkness and light, and by Marie-Jeanne Lecca’s elegant, stylish pre-Raphaelite costumes, whites and sombre greys and browns in the first three acts, then exploding into bright red as the passion is unleashed in Act 4. The symbolic water that pervades the play, with its wells and fountains and all-embracing sea, has invaded the old set and soaks everyone’s feet and, in her violent scene with Golaud, Mélisande’s hair (main picture).The key issue, though, is the intense musicality and psychological grasp of Pountney’s handling of the drama itself. There are fine individual touches at every point, but what counts above all is a certain understatement of movement that exactly reflects the tone and pace of this most discreet of all operatic scores. Watching Mélisande failing to relate to Golaud in the first scene, or her sudden radiance in Pellèas’s presence, is like watching the music unfold. As these characters float round each other or pick their laborious way through, or up and down, the lattice-work, one remembers Debussy’s fury at Nijinsky’s staging of Jeux which, he told a friend, “glared at the music as it went past”. This new Pelléas caresses the music, and I think Debussy would have loved it.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/pell%C3%A9as-et-m%C3%A9lisande-welsh-national-opera,5
321,"Carmen, Glyndebourne Festival Opera",Carmen,Glyndebourne Festival Opera,2015-05-24,Gavin Dixon,"After Calixto Bieito’s radical reimaging of Carmen, which opened at English National Opera this week, David McVicar’s version at Glyndebourne was bound to seem conservative. But it turned out to be a comparison of apples and Seville oranges: Bieito is certainly bolder, but McVicar is more sophisticated and digs deeper into the raw emotions of the work. It’s not a new production, but revival director Marie Lambert has kept it fresh, aided by a stunning cast and dynamic, energised conducting from Jakub Hrůša.McVicar sets his Carmen in the mid-to-late 19th century, a gentle updating that is most evident in the Act I set. The tobacco factory is presented as a mechanised and industrial affair, but in a state of decay. A large broken cog sits at one side of the stage and the colour scheme is rust-red. All very steam punk. In the second act, Pastia’s inn is in a small basement, entered from the street, visible above. The sets for the first two acts are large, but they force the action into the very front of the stage. That requires some imaginative positioning of the chorus, dancers, actors and children, who always seem to be competing for space, but it also serves to focus and concentrate the action. The stage opens out in the third act, the smuggler’s hideout a bare stage with just a wagon of booty in the centre and much dry ice for fog. And the finale takes place in front of a towering bullring wall, its ochre hue a visual reference to the rust red of Act I.Characters are finely drawn and carefully observed. Particularly impressive is Don José, sung by the Czech tenor Pavel Cernoch. His transformation and decline animates the production, from his first appearance as a shy and disinterested career soldier in Act I to the very credible murderer at the end (pictured right, the final confrontation). The final stages of his descent are perfectly realised at the end of Act III, as he stabs wildly with his knife into the engulfing fog, the offstage Toreador’s Song a phantom haunting his thoughts. Cernoch has a soft voice for the part, but it is agile, lyrical, and always secure.But the evening belonged to Stéphanie d’Oustrac, who was born to play Carmen. She is captivating from start to finish, completely dominating the stage whenever she appears. Again, not a huge voice (she’s better known as a Baroque specialist) but big enough to fill this house. She is always seductive and always gives the impression she’s playing by her own rules. Just listen to the way she pushes and pulls against Hrůša’s beat, teasing him as much as she does Don José, Zuniga and the rest.A strong supporting cast with no really weak links. David Soar (pictured left) has a rich tone as Escamillo, although is uncomfortable on some of the low notes. Lucy Crowe sounded a little husky as Micaëla – a slight cold perhaps? – but this never threatened the evenness of her production or the empathy she evoked for the character. (Why bring her back onstage for the dénouement though? That seemed crass.) Simon Lim appears on the cast list but not in the programme as Zuniga, suggesting a late substitution. But he gives far more that an understudy performance, bringing a commanding but agile bass voice to the role.Jakub Hrůša leads a dynamic and propulsive reading of the score. Tempos are brisk and accents are clean and firm. One or two awkward transitions mean that some of the set pieces don’t integrate as they might, but that is a small price to pay for such vital, imaginative and engaged music-making.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/carmen-glyndebourne-festival-opera,4

323,"Carmen, English National Opera",Carmen,English National Opera,2015-05-21,David Nice,"Crotch-grabbing, suggestions of oral and anal sex, stylized punching and kicking and other casual violence offer diminishing returns in your standard Calixto Bieito production. Sometimes a scene or two flashes focused brilliance, which only makes you wonder why he doesn’t apply the same rigour throughout. His 17-year-old Carmen has more such fitful insights than most of his other shows, and they’re very much complemented here by assured conducting and singing to make this punchy edition of Bizet’s amazing score, shorn of most of its dialogue, flash past at an energetic and colourful pace in its second run at ENO.Even so, I'd challenge anyone to read a rather cheeky programme note interpreting Bieito’s production points and find much that tallied in the performance. Late Franco era? Chances are that won't be clear. The point of the Lillas Pastia figure, an innkeeper whose car is his bar, tottering drunkenly on at curtain-up to Carmen’s own fateful music? The borderland wasteland-plus-beach location? Didn’t come across to me. And centrally flawed, surely, is the notion of Carmen as nothing but victim; in her final confrontation with a jealousy-maddened José, she needs to be proud and frightened simultaneously, not just teetering around terrified.Yes, I buy the Romany girl as a bottle-blonde eastern European immigrant (albeit anachronistically located in the 1970s) with an outsider’s accent. Bieito’s first Carmen at ENO, Ruxandra Donose, was Romanian, and Justina Gringyte hails from Lithuania, but neither comes close to the proud, inflammatory sensuality of Latvian Elina Garanča, the only Carmen I’ve ever seen to convince on a stage and a bit too pricey for ENO. Our heroine needs to be her own person much more than someone who seems compelled to put it about a lot for cash.Gringyte has a vibrant, metally tone, a true mezzo, but needs to refine it, as the lighter Donose could, for the French suavity rife in Bizet’s version of Spain. Any Opéra Comique elements, such as the needlepoint quintet in Act Two, have to be sacrificed to Coliseum size, and there’s not a great deal of refinement anywhere, though Richard Armstrong’s conducing has dash and a confidence born of long-term experience even while it lacks a bit of rhythmic precision.Impressive voices do fit the four main roles, though. This time we have a José of impeccable tenorial style in Eric Cutler (pictured above with Gringyte in Act Two), singing the much-debated top B flat in the Flower Song very quietly in head voice, as the score asks, and letting rip in the anguish of the last two acts, but with a finesse that should make his forthcoming Florestan and Lohengrin worth hearing.Eleanor Dennis (pictured left with George Humphreys' strong Corporal Moralès) is almost as impressive as the first of Bieito’s Micaëlas, the glorious Elizabeth Llewellyn, equally at home in long lyric-dramatic phrases, though she has to try and pull off the director’s tricky characterization of a come-hither, stand-back girl from the provinces.Fellow Scot - half-Scot, to be precise - Leigh Melrose returns as Escamillo, delivering a superbly energized Toreador Song with ringing top-note bravado; probably not his fault if the offstage repeat in the next act was virtually in a different key from the orchestra last night.By then the visual impact of Alfons Flores’s geographically indeterminate set – and is it day or night in the outer acts, where bright lights sit ill with pocket-camera flashes? – has gone up several notches. There are two Mercedes in Act Two, the character as spiritedly sung by Clare Presland and one with an engine to thump on – and six in Act Three, enough to evoke the smugglers’ lair more vividly than you’ll ever have seen it before (though the women have no costume change, suggesting they’ve come straight on from Lillas Pastia’s zone before the interval), and no time for Carmen's brief liaison with José to sour). Queasy as it is, I don’t find it gratuitous that Merc’s pretty-in-pink, clearly abused daughter should be part of the package for the customs men.Come the extra-bullring denouement, and Bieito reverts to convention, though rather beautifully – switching with the help of Bruno Poet’s ever versatile lighting from a raucous, waving crowd scene to Escamillo alone in toreador garb singing of his love for glammed-up Carmen. The final scene is predictably set within another ring of chalk; no surprises here and good, straightforward singing. You’ll not be bored, but don’t expect much finesse. That you'll probably get at Glyndebourne, an arena more fit for Bizet's crucial intimacies.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/carmen-english-national-opera-0,3
324,"Parsifal, CBSO, Nelsons, Symphony Hall, Birmingham",Parsifal,CBSO,2015-05-19,Peter Quantrill,"This was a very ""concert"" performance indeed. Across the stage music stands stood like sentinels lest any rash singer attempted to stand out and – surely not – act. Such fears were misplaced (or the stands did their job) in the end, as the music was what mattered and everyone stood and sang, with one outstanding exception, the Kundry of Mihoko Fujimura.It can be no coincidence that of all the singers on stage she knew her role most intimately, and had worked for some years with Stefan Herheim in his celebrated production at Bayreuth. That said, Burkhard Fritz (pictured below) has sung the title role in later revivals of the same staging, without apparently gaining a focused image of the part, or requiring himself to project an embodied impression of it. Is Parsifal more than an idiot savant Siegfried? Is he ever prepared to be the kind of saviour that Gurnemanz or Amfortas are looking for? This was not the place for answers. Strictly vocal compensation was limited by a dry upper register and the sense of one singing well within his means until he appeared at the back of the stage to save the day with a resplendent “Nur, eine Waffe taugt”.Fujimura, too, had the unique ability to fill the hall without great apparent effort: there is a rounded, vatic quality to her dramatic mezzo which suggests that it is coming to the listener at the end of a long tunnel. As Gurnemanz, Georg Zeppenfeld most nearly approached her authority, with a scrupulous use of the text to lift his lengthy narratives, and a gently resonant, bell-like bass that fell easily on the ear. Rutherford’s Amfortas also sounded well in the hall, and comfortable, too much so to leave more than a neutral impression of compromised kingship.The effort to do more than sing must be considerable under the antiseptic conditions of a well-lit concert hall, but Fujimura made it, seemingly with the prop of her Bayreuth experience foremost in mind, since the Kundry of this first act was no wild woman but a stern governess fully in charge of James Rutherford’s Amfortas while simultaneously in thrall to forces of arrogance and shame she is only beginning to understand, knowing rather than wounded in her retort to the impertinent squires (sung by Alexander Sprague and Edward Harrisson), “Are the beasts here not holy too?” Chemistry with her saviour and master in Act Two was never confined by her imagination but by the limited responses of Fritz, and the stolidly sung, gruffly presented Klingsor of Wolfgang Bankl.Without yet having led a performance from the pit – that time will surely come, and soon – Andris Nelsons has a clear vision for the piece, at least in the first two acts, and after eight years as Music Director, he has the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra right at the end of his baton: the orchestral response was remarkably prompt, and in a neat accelerando back-out of Act One’s communion scene to the knights’ dispersal, he conducted with progressively smaller beat to bring everyone together with him. He is well prepared to pull around the tempo rather than plod through recitative, which made his conservative, three-in-a-bar restraint for Act Two’s ballet-chanté (Parsifal’s great Massenet-moment) “Komm, holder Knabe” the more puzzling, though the solo Flowermaidens (led by Erica Eloff and Alexandra Steiner) floated with individual, unblended delicacy through Klingsor’s magic garden of suspended animation.Act Three sagged from Parsifal’s entrance (Fujimura having entirely eschewed the screams and groans which, on paper at least, are so prominent a feature of Kundry’s presence) and slowed further in the Good Friday music to a trudge through the Transformation music, and only picked up from Sunday-oratorio solemnity in the closing minutes. This loss of tension also congealed and clotted the instrumental balance which had kept the previous acts flowing and glowing without the cheap odour of incense or turgid simulacra of ""depth"" that have commonly afflicted the opera: recessed, sweetly modulated strings, brass kept in check except for moments of maximum impact, attention often focused on wind choirs and soloists, notably the clarinet of Oliver Janes.The men of the CBSO chorus were honest knights of the grail, always good with the words, which made the final act’s burial march for Titurel (the implausibly youthful Paul Whelan) all the more dramatically incomprehensible when sung not as call and lamenting response between two groups but in one mass. The important off-stage female chorus was as secure in ensemble and pitch as I have ever heard it, and contributed significantly to a poised and flowing first-act communion scene. Relatively abstract moments such as this and the second-act prelude, so vividly conveying not generic evil but Klingsor’s fury of sexual agitation, raised the performance from its context and deservedly won the eventual, inevitable standing ovation. It’s clear that Birmingham will miss Nelsons – “Komm, holder Knabe” indeed.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/parsifal-cbso-nelsons-symphony-hall-birmingham,4
325,"Il Trovatore, Scottish Opera",Il Trovatore,Scottish Opera,2015-05-18,David Kettle,"""The darkness deceived me,"" sings Leonora in Act I as she mistakenly rushes into the arms of the Count di Luna, rather than those of her beloved, the mysterious troubador Manrico who’s been serenading her for nights on end. Seeing Robert B Dickson’s sepulchral lighting in Scottish Opera’s semi-new production of Verdi’s melodramatic shocker Il trovatore – an updated version of the company’s 1992 staging – you can understand why. The production’s Caravaggio-esque gloomy depths and ominous, looming shadows (used to particularly grotesque and unsettling effect in the famous ""Anvil Chorus"") soon make the point that the work is indeed unremittingly dark, but they don’t do much to highlight its almost camp excess or its credulity-testing plot twists.Which is a shame, because the show’s performances – at least vocally – are almost universally exceptionally strong, and vividly characterised. Top of the heap is Claire Rutter as a touchingly naive, heartstring-tugging Leonora, seemingly unaware of the high gothic melodrama she’s in the middle of, and singing with moving restraint and an astonishing vocal control. Her subtle vocal swells whenever she’s near her beloved Manrico tell us all we need to know about her idealised longing.Gwyn Hughes Jones makes a very lucid, expressive Manrico, with a laser-like focus to his quite piercing tenor and a vocal vigour to match. And Anne Mason (pictured right being restrained by Ferrando's men) is suitably sultry but affectingly sincere as the gypsy mother Azucena. Roland Wood might bellow somewhat as the Count, but there’s a rugged determination to his portrayal nonetheless. The chorus is on highly impressive form, and eloquently choreographed by Kally Lloyd-Jones. Male for the most part (save in a brief scene of limpid beauty as the nuns gather to welcome Leonora into the convent), their singing is crisp and immaculately drilled, and startlingly powerful at times.Down in the pit – the lighting of which, even with stand lights, threatens to distract attention from the dingy stage – Swedish conductor Tobias Ringborg has the Scottish Opera Orchestra in fine fettle, their playing bright and bold, gloriously blaring at times. There’s a convincing Verdian sweep to Ringborg's broad phrasing, a gentle suppleness to his rhythms and a crisp clarity to his textures.In musical terms, it’s a roaring success. But most of the production’s drama is squarely within the music, because there’s not a great deal of it in the rather unambitious, static staging. It falls uncomfortably between detailed naturalism and stylised conceptualism – all looming monoliths and projections of smoke and fire – and as a result feels like it does little to dig into the more serious themes behind the work’s macabre excess, or even to present that exuberance in all its gory glory. Too often the characters simply stand and sing at the audience. We may be moved by the subtleties and power of their vocal deliveries, but it’s hard to feel particularly compelled or convinced by the storytelling.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/il-trovatore-scottish-opera,3
326,"Peter Pan, Welsh National Opera",Peter Pan,Welsh National Opera,2015-05-17,stephen Walsh,"I must have been one of the few in Saturday’s audience for Richard Ayres’s new opera who had never seen Barrie’s play or read the book, so I’m unable to judge how faithfully it renders the original – in case that matters. Somehow one knows the dramatis personae: Peter Pan himself, the Darling family, Nana the dog-nurse, Captain Hook, Tinkerbell, Tiger Lily and of course the ticking crocodile, who swallowed Hook’s watch along with his arm. They are all here, wittily, sometimes brilliantly, reimagined in Keith Warner’s panto-like staging. What eluded me, and perhaps not only me, was the narrative pacing that must be a feature of a play that has held the stage, in one form or another, for over a hundred years. And for this, one looks to the music.A former student of Morton Feldman and pupil of Louis Andriessen, Richard Ayres has long since abandoned the spare gestures of Eighth Street expressionism and the noisy simplicity of Dutch minimalism in favour of an eclectic style that can, with considerable skill, soak up everything from blues to Richard Strauss to Philip Glass to Andrew Lloyd Webber. This Peter Pan is an ideas bank. Something new and worthwhile pops up every minute or so, richly and beguilingly scored, thumped at the audience with exhilarating panache. It may not be particularly a music for children, of whom there were a good many in Saturday’s audience, to all appearances enjoying themselves, if without wild enthusiasm. But it colours the action vividly enough, dramatises its drama, tenderises its tenderness, and so forth.It’s a music that stops as often as it startsWhat it doesn’t do is propel the plot in any way at all. It’s a music that stops as often as it starts, a music that – while mobile in short bursts – continually hangs fire in the longer view. It has phrases and sentences, but few paragraphs. And while the orchestral writing shows flair, the writing for voice is uneasy. Ayres knows when lyricism is called for, but he has an odd way of answering the call. Wendy’s second-act aria – though beautifully sung by Marie Arnet – has a line that seems to cut against the natural flow of librettist Lavinia Greenlaw’s text. The pirates’ music is lively and bouncy but fails to dance, in spite of some nice individual vignettes (Mark Le Brocq, Simon Crosby Buttle). Even Peter himself can’t get a musical line off the ground half as easily as the wires that swing him and the Darling children so thrillingly above the stage and away to Neverland.So it’s an evening of striking images and frustrating discourse. Jason Southgate’s sets work cleverly to suggest the immanence of fairyland on the outskirts of every child’s bedroom, and there is endless wit and magic in Nicky Shaw’s costumes and Bruno Poet’s lighting. I loved Tinkerbell as a flickering ghost, and the crocodile as a grandfather clock (clock o’dial?). I liked the pirate ship with headlights, coming inshore like the Flying Dutchman. Maybe the stage is at times cluttered and movement stagnates; and it can’t be said that the problem of Nana is entirely solved, though Aidan Smith woofs and snarls with impressive articulacy.Above all, a strong cast and energetic chorus rarely get the chance to show their full mettle. Iestyn Morris (pictured right by Clive Barda) catches the disturbing, somewhat disagreeable darkness of Peter Pan with his disembodied countertenor, but really has little of note to sing, considering that he is the controlling character. Best served is Ashley Holland, with two good musical grumbles as Mr Darling struggling with his bowtie and Captain Hook lamenting the loss of his arm. Nicholas Sharratt and Rebecca Bottone are excellent as Wendy’s siblings, Hilary Summers adequate but one-dimensional as their Mother, more notable, briefly, as the squaw-like Tiger Lily, whose surrogate motherhood consists of threatening to cut Wendy’s throat.In the end it’s the orchestra, under Erik Nielsen, that comes out best. They have bravura moments, a few spectacular solo breaks, and in general they carry the musical plot. What this says about Peter Pan as an opera is a good question. We’ll have to ask the kids.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/peter-pan-welsh-national-opera,2
327,"Being Both, Coote, English Concert, Bicket, Brighton Dome",Being Both,Coote,2015-05-16,Matthew Wright,"Over the past decade Alice Coote has emerged as a singer of rare and exquisite vocal quality. Even when the direction of a project is questioned, there has generally been consensus that she generally sounds gorgeous. The concept of Being Both, a juxtaposition of Handel mezzo arias for both male and female characters, is brilliant both musically and commercially. It allows a fascinating exploration of identity and sexuality in a period when both, in opera, were pretty fluid; and it makes, conveniently, for a programme of Handel’s greatest hits.It’s unfortunate that according to director Susannah Waters’ notes, the idea was inspired by one of opera’s less endearing episodes, the insensitive description last year by a gentleman of the press of mezzo Tara Erraught – playing Strauss’s Octavian – as a “chubby bundle of puppy fat”. Fortunately, the issue of physical appearance and body image was given less prominence than the more interesting question of gender identity as expressed musically. Though Coote’s outfit is bizarrely accessorised (of which, more later), the basic attire of gender-nonspecific black jeans and shirt suppresses any obvious gender identification, all the better to concentrate on the music.  The programme gave full scope to Coote’s expressive power. From the swashbuckling Ruggiero (Alcina), to the boyish Ariodante, the voluptuous Semele and Cleopatra, the desperate Theodora, distressed Ginevra (Ariodante) and demure Dejanira (Hercules), with a digression into oratorio narrative for “He Was Despised” from Messiah, all varieties of emotion were explored, religious as well as romantic.The point, if such a crude thing could emerge from such uniformly ravishing music, was that passion, sorrow and lust sound pretty similar expressed by man or woman; and religious sorrow can sound much like romantic abandonment. Gender colouring, such as there was, came more from the orchestral parts: the jaunty, energetic strings and pooping horns accompanying Ruggiero are more macho than the desolate wailing bassoon of Ariodante’s “Scherza infida” or the passionately heaving string phrases of Cleopatra’s “Se pietà”, for example, though that is as much a question of dramatic context as it is gender.   For much of the show, the musical riches were overwhelming. Coote’s voice has a kind of double layering, enabling her to project with some force while, seemingly simultaneously decorating the edge of even a robust note with the height of a phrase, then retreat to a fluttering delicacy immediately. This was particularly effective during Semele’s dizzy “Myself I shall adore”, though it’s a versatile tool: the subtlety with which, for example, the word “despised” slipped from a hiss to a sigh was delicious.The Brighton Dome is a large and not obviously sympathetic space for a concert whose predominant mood was intimacy. The English Concert, under Harry Bicket, matched Coote step-for-step during the more vivacious passages, and the delicate solos – the bassoon of “Scherza infida” for example – were also exquisitely phrased and beautifully pure, but on occasion felt rather underpowered when playing piano. (The Old Market would perhaps have been better suited to the repertoire.)The universality of emotion, expressed so delicately by the music, was, however, hammered home by the set and direction with quite un-Handelian clumsiness. For the entire concert actors were painting the phrase “You who are more than one thing / You who exceed expectations” on a wall behind the orchestra, as if that idea were not conveyed with infinitely greater subtlety by the music. At one point Coote herself joined the decorating crew’s graffiti team; her letters dribbled horribly. It’s just as well she won’t need to give up her musical career, because her handicraft skills are unpromising. At another moment, a ballerina in pink tutu (redundant after Ginevra's dream ballet sequence) joined the decorating crew. Even for Brighton...Meanwhile, in front of the orchestra, there was a baffling assortment of bric-a-brac with which Coote was obliged to toy. The spinning wheel, breastplate and plastic wings made some dramatic sense, though weren’t really necessary. But the empty bath, in which Coote sang most of “He was despised”? Or the portable blackboard, seemingly purloined from a mackerel fisherman on the seafront, on which a series of daft slogans were written, and which for some time Coote wore around her neck, standing on top of a plinth? For several songs Coote resembled a semiotician’s model as she dangled peculiar symbols around her neck. It was most distracting, and gave the evening a perspective on both the most exciting and the most exasperating features of the contemporary operatic scene, as some ravishingly sung and intriguingly programmed pieces were, to some extent, undermined by facile sloganising.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/being-both-coote-english-concert-bicket-brighton-dome,3
328,"The Pirates of Penzance, English National Opera",The Pirates of Penzance,English National Opera,2015-05-10,David Nice,"When ENO announced its return to Gilbert and Sullivan, rapture at the news that Mike Leigh, genius Topsy-Turvy director, would be the master of wonderland ceremonies was modified by its choice, The Pirates of Penzance. Last staged at the Coliseum – and unmemorably – as recently as 2004, the fifth Savoy opera seemed less in need of revisiting than several larger-scale successors. By the end of last night, though, it was clear not only that Leigh and his musical team had been the best possible choice to tackle this work of classical perfection, but also that if operatic schedules could be rearranged and our greatest living Savoyard didn't have more films to make, he should return to give us one of these light-opera gems every season. That could keep the house happy for over a decade.Having been tickled recently by the resourcefulness of companies staging the Savoy operas on a shoestring, not least Charles Court Opera’s reinventions at Islington’s King’s Head and the return of Sasha Regan’s all-male Pirates, I wondered what Leigh could do to charm us just as much. The answer would seem to lie in serving, as he writes in a fascinating programme note, ""the Gilbertian requirements of outrageousness delivered straight"", more or less as Gilbert the director seems to have done, and rather more than less. The results are exactly the opposite of the camp busyness which smothered a Scottish Opera Pirates and the Finborough Theatre’s disastrously re-written Princess Ida. There’s also something serious beneath the surface being said about time, the young being old and the old being childlike, which eludes clear definition, by me at any rate.Down in the pit, David Parry captures the ingenious orchestration and the loving spoofs of everything from Handel to Wagner, so not just the bel canto repertoire he knows so well, with the perfect mixture of élan and subtlety, guiding the best of choruses and a very classy line-up of soloists into fresh and nuanced takes on the score. The results stand in the same relation to Regan’s riotous send-up as the Royal Ballet Swan Lake – or, rather better at the moment, the English National Ballet version – does to Matthew Bourne’s brilliant alternative: I wouldn’t want to be without either.You neither can nor need to take Pirates out of its Victorian framework: after all, the paradox of a leap-year baby born on 29 February, thus reaching his 21st birthday in 1940, the tongue in cheek homage to Queen Victoria and the excessive reverence for the House of Lords – which is what the gone-wrong pirates turn out to be, no real plot spoiler there – demand no less. Yet the timelessness is there too. So Alison Chitty’s beautifully crinolined daughters of Major General Stanley, Victorian picturebook pirates and very 19th century policemen are contained within a more topsy-turvy kind of set which makes great play of the circular frame in the middle of the stage – I won’t spoil its funniest use, since the production photographer hasn’t either – as well as the stylised mix of blue sea and green rocky mountain.That also makes the best of a space that’s not ideal for the intimacies of G&S (the present Savoy Theatre would always be a better option). Within it, Leigh effectively groups his principals and his chorus – only 13 daughters and a modest police force, very wise, though rather more in the way of pirates – so that, for instance, 12 of the daughters, shocked that sister Mabel should have declared devotion for unindentured pirate Frederic, decide they need to sing about the weather and cluster at the front of the stage to keep a keen eye on Parry. Thus the timing here and nearly everywhere else is impeccable.There's no weak link in song and speech among the principals. Perhaps Rebecca de Pont Davies doesn’t quite cut the sympathetic 47-year-old figure Leigh clearly wants her to be in what his article describes as a very Gilbertian meditation on the rough deal life hands to the plain and ageing, but she’s still an unusual Ruth, the nursery maid hard of hearing who’s apprenticed young Frederic to a pirate, not a pilot. Joshua Bloom cuts a colossal dash as the Pirate King, obviously a nob from his accent, huge of diction and bass delivery but easy in his body so as not to quite overdo the camp like Jonny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean. His opposite number – the link is made that both pirates and policemen try to do their duty, the theme of the work, but succumb all too easily to tender feeling – is the Sergeant of Jonathan Lemalu, another remarkable bass from the other side of the world. His deadpan delivery and melancholy crumpling for the famous number about a policeman’s lot are another splendid example of how underplaying the absurdity always works best.It’s good to hear a proper lyric tenor, Robert Murray, as Frederic, who gets some of Sullivan’s loveliest lyric inspirations. He’s bound to be outshone by the human dynamo of Claudia Boyle’s Mabel (pictured above with Murray and her ""sisters"") delivering her wondrous waltz song with all the fun in the coloratura fireworks suggesting she could take on the role of Strauss’s Zerbinetta tomorrow. Like Valerie Masterson and Rebecca Evans before her, she takes the gold medal of G&S sopranohood, and on her first outing. The Act Two duet is as rapt and touching as Sullivan, master of pathos at surprising moments, intended it to be. And anyone who thought they might miss king of patter Richard Suart in the role of Major-General Stanley – he played the role here in 2004 – might have guessed that Andrew Shore (pictured above left) would not let them down. His old buffer is all naïve charm, dancing in a ring with his gels before embarking on a routine they all know inside out.That Shore was playing Wagner’s Beckmesser only a couple of months ago isn’t the only reminder of that all-conquering ENO Mastersingers. As the company launch into the glory of an ode to poetry to give the Act One finale a special twist, we’re reminded that they were hailing Hans Sachs in only slightly more elevated style on the same stage recently. The warmth we feel inside at that point comes and goes throughout. So while you may laugh a lot but not to the point of crying, which I did in the all-male touring Pirates, the pleasure runs deep, encouraging the same love for this masterpiece and its companions that Leigh so obviously feels and can put so stylishly into disciplined action.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/pirates-penzance-english-national-opera,4
329,"Dalibor, BBCSO, Bělohlávek, Barbican",Dalibor,BBCSO,2015-05-03,Gavin Dixon,"Jiří Bělohlávek and the BBC Symphony Orchestra are on to a good thing with Czech opera. Prague is a major centre for world-class opera, but much of the repertoire performed there is all but unknown abroad. Bělohlávek, who holds positions in both Prague and London, has found a way to broaden its audience: presenting a series of concert performances with the BBC Symphony Orchestra and soloists brought in from the State Opera. The repertoire may be obscure, at least for London audiences, but the idiomatic performances that result ensure nothing is treated as a mere curiosity. Here we have a conductor and soloists for whom this is core repertoire, and who are more than capable of demonstrating why it is so revered at home.Dalibor is Smetana’s ""other"" opera. Of the eight he composed, only The Bartered Bride achieved widespread popularity in his lifetime, but of the others it put in the shade, this was the one the composer himself felt deserved the attention. It’s a tragedy, with a story that parallels Fidelio. Dalibor (Richard Samek) is a knight who has incited an uprising and been condemned to death. The second act is set in a dungeon and, as in Fidelio, involves a female character, Milada (Dana Burešová), dressing as a man to gain entry and effect his escape. It ends badly, of course, but the piece wears its tragedy more lightly than does Fidelio; it’s not as dour, and much of the drama is conveyed with a sardonic lightness, the orchestra often accompanying with bright military marches or folksy melodic lines.This performance was a “concert staging” conceived by Kenneth Richardson. He didn’t add much, often allowing long sections to play out as straight concert performance. But what he did add was effective. When Vladislav (Ivan Kusnjer), the Czech King who condemns Dalibor, makes his grand entrance, it is with several minutes of regal fanfares. Having him approach the stage via the stalls gave a sense of ceremony commensurate with the music. There were also some costume changes for Milada, when cross-dressed sporting both a flat cap and high heels, some perfunctory props, and some basic lighting effects. It was all done with a light touch, providing a sense of context without distracting.The seven Czech singers made up a strong cast, impressive as much for their ensembles as their solo contributions. The strongest and most agile voice belonged to soprano Alžběta Poláčková in the role of Jitka. She and Vítek (Aleš Voráček, both pictured left) stand apart from the main plot, more observers than participants. But their love duet at the end of the first act is a highlight of the work, and all the more so for their perfectly matched voices here. Similarly the duet between Milada and Dalibor (Richard Samek) in the second. Both Burešová and Samek sang in the grand opera tradition, big voices with indulgent articulation but plenty of passion: absolutely ideal here. The nearest thing to a weak link was Ivan Kusnjer as the king, Vladislav.  His baritone sounded past its prime and lacked richness. Always clear though, and suitably imposing.The BBC Singers handled the chorus part well, especially the basses, who are called on to represent the judges condemning Dalibor in the first act and the monks commending his soul in the last. A fine performance from the BBC Symphony Orchestra too. Some sour tuning from the woodwinds in the first few minutes quickly resolved. The string playing was particularly fine, the ensemble providing a rich, unified sound for Smetana’s flowing melodic lines.But the real star of this performance spent most of it consigned to shadows by the theatrical lighting. Jiří Bělohlávek conducted with a sure hand, giving a lyrical and dramatically astute performance. He resisted the continual temptations of the score to indulge in excess, yet never skimped on drama and passion when called for. He also has the ability to communicate closely with singers who are standing behind him, a rare art indeed.The last performance in this series, of The Bartered Bride in 2011, was given a high-profile CD release by Harmonia Mundi, and it is to be hoped that they will follow suit with this equally deserving Dalibor.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/dalibor-bbcso-b%C4%9Blohl%C3%A1vek-barbican,5
330,"The Virtues of Things, Linbury Studio Theatre",The Virtues of Things,Linbury Studio Theatre,2015-05-03,alexandra Coghlan,"How many words would you expect in an average libretto? 10,000? 15,000? Whatever that number is you can triple it and then some for The Virtues of Things – a new opera from Sally O’Reilly and Matt Rogers of astonishing, exhausting, battering wordiness. And with all these extra words what does it have to say? Not a great deal, frankly.If you’ve read your Saussure – or, failing that, Marquez’s One Hundred Years of Solitude would do – then you’ll be familiar with the concept of ""signifiers"" and ""signifieds"". (Yes, a basic knowledge of semiotics really is necessary to get to grips with an opera that insists on calling its characters names like “Parabola” and “Ellipsis”). At their simplest, signifiers are tables, tigers, underwear, while their signifieds are the concepts these objects might represent – hospitality, danger, an adulterous relationship. There’s a gap, we understand, between objects and their significance, words and their meanings – an idea that’s really not as complicated as Rogers and O’Reilly would have us believe.The Selby family’s prop-making business is thrown into confusion when sickness sweeps through various members, causing them to confuse the operatic fictions they create and their own realities. Forced to bring in young freelancer Eames (Paul Curievici) to help with the workload, the family are further dismayed at his radical modern methods, creating illusions that are dangerously believable.The cast are superb and outwardly unfazed by the sheer amount going on, gamely throwing themselves at the mountains of text, all the while managing the various bits of visual silliness that director Bijan Sheibani tries to squeeze into the gaps between large chunks of information being exchanged. Rogers’ vocal writing rarely unbends into melody, but both the wonderfully watchable Curievici and soprano Robyn Parton (Peg) manage to discover some beautiful lines in it, even when sitting in the outer reaches of their register. These two also carry the lion’s share of the drama, playing nicely off one another as tragedy and farce begin to collide.David Stout (pictured right with Kimm, Curievici and Parton) gets the closest thing going to an aria, and if he makes less impression here than in the recent ENO Figaro then he also has a lot less to work with. There’s a glorious romp of a performance from Fiona Kimm (pictured below) as Ellipsis, revelling in her descent into madness and bringing some much needed darker vocal colours to a score that tends to the bright and high.Rogers’ orchestral writing (performed here by the Aurora Orchestra, conducted by Richard Baker) is a little too texturally dominant, with prominent writing for flute, piccolo and saxophone. The results compete with the singers, desperately trying to project endless swathes of recitative, and the ear is caught in the crossfire. There’s too much talk here and not enough song, weighing down vocal lines and reducing the orchestra to a rather literal, descriptive role, forced like the director to occupy the only spaces and silences left in the all-consuming text.There are some nice details here: the fictional operas for which the Selbys make their props include the inspired The Tilting Women in which besieged women scheme to cut off their buttocks to feed their menfolk and allow them to withstand starvation and the enemy for that much longer, and there are some pointed truths about the nature of opera and theatre-craft. But generally The Virtues of Things tries to say far too much in too many words and ends up tripping over its own sentences.If you do want to spend an evening pondering the relationship between art and reality, words and meaning, or questioning the nature of illusion (while also having some fun) I’d suggest you go and see The Real Inspector Hound, read a Calvino or Coetzee novel, or watch Mulholland Drive before you try your luck with The Virtues of Things.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/virtues-things-linbury-studio-theatre,2
331,"Król Roger, Royal Opera",Król Roger,Royal Opera,2015-05-02,alexandra Coghlan,"Let’s get one thing straight at the outset: Szymanowski’s 1926 opera Król Roger isn’t a lovely occasional oddity, a rarity whose appeal is largely novelty, or a dust-it-off-once-a-decade sort of piece. It’s that rarest of things, a real and original masterpiece whose worth has been unaccountably undervalued. This new production by Kasper Holten does nothing to obscure its beauty, making a strong case not only for the work’s sensual appeal, but also the larger philosophical architecture underpinning this maverick score.That Król Roger has recently begun to enjoy more attention internationally has a lot to do with charismatic Polish baritone Mariusz Kwiecien, whose affinity for the work has led to fine performances in Paris (2008) and Santa Fe (2012). In the Royal Opera’s current cast however he has some serious rivalry from perhaps the finest ensemble the company has assembled yet this season.From Alan Ewing’s opening cameo as the Archbishop, setting the auditorium vibrating with the depth and force of his Russian Orthodox-style chant, to the muscular purity of Georgia Jarman’s Roxana and the unearthly purity and athleticism of Saimir Pirgu’s tenor, they collectively revel in the extremity and the vivid musical characterisation of Szymanowski’s score. Which is all the more impressive, given that the work’s vocal writing is almost secondary to the extraordinary things happening in the orchestra.Antonio Pappano constantly reassesses and adjusts the balance between Szymanowski’s Mediterranean languor and expansive sensuality and his more Austro-Germanic instincts, steering a score that veers between Wagner, Strauss and Debussy through its course with instinctual urgency. What a shame the Royal Opera didn’t decide to run the piece (a mere 90 minutes) straight through without an interval. Falling with barely half an hour of music left, it’s an intrusion that shakes the audience out of the hazy intoxication of Act II’s orgiastic conclusion, fracturing the continuity of thought and emotion that is so key to the opera’s argument.The plot is simple enough; a shepherd visits the kingdom of the Christian King Roger and spreads a pagan doctrine of pleasure and beauty. Despite the people’s calls for his death, both the king and his wife Roxana succumb to his philosophy, eventually followed by the entire court. In a final scene, the shepherd reveals himself to be Dionysius – pleasure incarnate – but despite his power, Roger chooses to seek hope and redemption on his own terms.Holten retains elements of the opera’s original 12th-century Sicilian setting in Steffen Aarfing’s amphitheatre-like design, framing the entire stage, while relocating the action to the 1920s – the date of the opera’s composition. This world of Freudian psychoanalysis becomes a prism to refract Szymanowski’s meditation on the duality of human nature – the battle between head and body that troubles the king. Visually this creates a beautiful synthesis with a score whose tugging, conflicting urges sees it lurching between musical sensuality and intellectual rigour.Both opening and closing moments see Holten’s best work, capturing the opera’s dualities in two striking visual symbols: the darkness of the stage at the start, gradually filled and animated by the chorus’s Byzantine-inspired chanting. Boy trebles (from the Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School) keep the tone cool and Classical, preventing the throbbing emotion of these melodies from spilling too far into sensuality. The end, by contrast, sees the stage suddenly flooded with light – blinding the audience with radiance, even as the light of clarity and certainty breaks within Roger himself.Between these dramatic poles the action plays out within a giant head (pictured above). If that sounds too literal a treatment of a psychodrama, it allows for a clarity of symbolism that creates a successful friction with the score’s more uncertain, more fluctuating, ideas. Divided into Freudian levels, the skull’s upper regions (super-ego) are occupied by the king and library, while below choreographer Cathy Marston’s dancers writhe and beckon – a seductive Id indeed.Caught between the two, both Roger and Roxana struggle in some exquisite music – Roxana’s Act II plea for clemency chief among them. Jarman’s (pictured left with Kim Begley as Edrisi) vocal poise, never tipping over into Salome territory but retaining a purity even through her fullest moments, is remarkable, but matched for impact by Kwiecien (indisposed on opening night, but showing little vocal sign of it) and his expansive vocal ecstasy in the opera’s final moments, no less brilliant than Jon Clark’s lighting.It would be easy to succumb to the opera’s sensuality and sacrifice Król Roger entirely to visual sensation. Holten pulls back from this, gesturing to the erotic with the delicate play of light and image, but never fully surrendering to it. The result is thought as well as felt, an operatic experience that leaves you breathless in the moment, but with plenty still to ponder the next day.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/kr%C3%B3l-roger-royal-opera,5
332,"Trial by Jury / The Zoo, King's Head Theatre",Trial by Jury / The Zoo,King's Head Theatre,2015-04-28,David Nice,"Judge Judy meets The Only Way Is Essex: this endlessly resourceful production of Gilbert and Sullivan’s first (mini) masterpiece Trial by Jury is one that cries out to appear on TV. Which in a make-believe sense it does: we’re the audience in the studio where Court on Camera is about to air. A warm-up chappie who turns out to be the Usher (Wagnerian bass-baritone in training Martin Lamb) – on other Sundays it will be a lady – gauges our capacity to applaud and boo, and we’re off on a case of breach of promise of marriage as you never saw it before.The pleasure is doubled because in Charles Court Opera’s double bill, the Essex former couple – am I allowed to put ""chavs""? – who get in to a real old ding-dong with each other are dazzlingly transformed from a sweet if hapless pair with sellotaped specs in The Zoo, a trifle which is very evidently Sullivan and not Gilbert; the libretto’s by Bolton Rowe, who doesn’t have the master’s capacity for felicitous rhymes or a tendency to stress wrongly only when it’s funny. Still, the plot's foursome of star-crossed lovers are stock Gilbertian territory, both beautifully sung and acted by fresh young opera singers.Our to-be-metamorphosed pair are the stunningly transformable Catrine Kirkman as Laetitia Grinder (centre in photo right) and perfect lyric tenor David Menezes as Aesculapius Carboy (pictured on the left), an apothecary less than eligible in the eyes of Laetitia’s father (played by Matthew Kellett, a congenial Robin Oakapple in the company’s unbeatable Ruddigore). The other couple are a bonny refreshment-stall hostess, Eliza Smith (Nichola Jolley, doubling as chav's best friend at the trial), who feeds the well-out-of-sight and (mostly) irrelevant animals as well as homo sapiens, and her suitor ""Thomas Brown"", in true proto-Gilbertian style a peer in disguise, whose patrician airs company doyen and director John Savournin is well capable of assuming. Despite a near fatal visit to the bear-pit, love conquers all and nothing much happens (though my four-year-old goddaughter, riveted and sometimes alarmed by it all, especially enjoyed the rolling to and fro of ""Mr Brown"" once he’d had too much to eat).Musically there are a few distinctive Sullivan charms here, not least Eliza’s arietta about her suitor, and a few clear cross-references to Trial by Jury, which was already running when The Zoo opened in 1875. The set could do with an inexpensive makeover – some visual suggestion of the beasts, perhaps, in Richard Jones fashion – but there’s no faulting the performances.If this is funny, Trial by Jury is hysterically so. Ask not how the wide-boy defendant and the heavily pregnant jilted bride come to sing such cultivated lyrics, nor how an American lady judge could have so penetrated the English class system and persuaded a presumably rather conservative rich attorney to let her wed his ""elderly, ugly daughter""; this is already topsy-turvyville where the jury are peculiarly partial from the start.Except, this being a company of seven, plus their tireless pianist and music director David Eaton, there can be no choruses of jurymen and bridesmaids. Hence the highly inventive virtue made from necessity of locating a studio jury in the audience. The choral parts are cleverly carved up among the principals, giving for instance Kellett’s shabby “I was young once, too” Clerk and Philip Lee’s slick Counsel to the Plaintiff some delicious extra lines. I’ve already given the game away about the Judge, and a photo only compounds it, which is a shame because that character’s entry came as a real surprise to me: Savournin’s tall personage in elegant drag and with mirthful ad-libs (pictured above with Jolley and Menezes).Superb as ever though Savournin is, the show is decisively stolen by Kirkman’s gum-chewing, smoking, moueing, hoop-earringed Plaintiff. Daring of her to sing in character both flat and flatly, at least until the Italianate ensemble “A nice dilemma”. We found it a little worrying that said four-year-old thought her a ""pretty princess"", though she did enjoy impersonating the lip contortions. Whatever your feelings about this Essex Ange(lina), Kirkman's performance is the stuff of which awards are made. As is the production itself, a sure-fire Fringe Firster. What with this, the company’s Ruddigore and Sasha Regan's all-male Pirates of Penzance, Mike Leigh with his ENO Pirates... just around the corner will have a hard job making us laugh even half as much.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/trial-jury-zoo-kings-head-theatre,4
333,"Die Walküre Act 3, WNO, Koenigs, Wales Millennium Centre, Cardiff",Die Walküre Act 3,WNO,2015-04-27,stephen Walsh,"There’s a lot to be said for concert performances of Wagner. Not only are you spared the post-prandial lucubrations of aspirant directors – the moonmen and the fighter pilots, the jackboots and the biogas installations. But it’s possible to concentrate on Wagner’s greatest theatrical gift: not his stagecraft or stage imagery, but his management of time and psychological growth through purely musical means. And the final act of Die Walküre, which the Wales Millennium Centre mounted in a concert performance by Welsh National Opera on Sunday, is the best possible example, with its evolving confrontation between Wotan and Brünnhilde, the daughter he adores but who has defied what she is gradually able to show are his falsified intentions.Wagner maintained that opera was above all the art of transition, and these 80 minutes or so of unbroken symphonic music demonstrate the point to perfection. From the relentless Hojotohos and Heiahas of the Valkyries in their famous Ride, through Brünnhilde’s desperate flight with the terrified Sieglinde, Wotan’s rage at her betrayal as he sees it, and her gradual wearing down of his fury into a passionate regret and valediction, the emotional trajectory is controlled entirely through musical pacing and the exquisitely timed introduction of new musical ideas.Staging, by contrast, can be an embarrassment: the wretched Valkyries with their (usually invisible) steeds and raucous militarism, Brünnhilde doing her tubby best to look both bellicose and feminine. Sunday’s vestigial production was uncredited, but it had enough of these elements and no more. Bryn Terfel acted Wotan’s changing temper brilliantly through vocal and facial expression; he and the Swedish soprano Iréne Theorin related perfectly through minimal but well-judged movement. Their long dialogue was as moving as I’ve ever experienced it in a staged production, and for the most part as finely sung.Terfel is not, to my mind, a true Wagnerian bass. The tone is beautiful but not ideally dark. But he overcomes what he probably doesn’t agree is a problem by sheer musical intelligence, vocal technique and immaculate taste. In this performance there was hardly a note misplaced, even when, occasionally, he played fast and loose with Wagner’s exact pitches. And every vocal nuance had its facial or gestural counterpart, likewise precisely judged. Theorin (pictured above) I found less refined, perhaps less exact in her control, but highly expressive and with a strong, bright sonority. The Sieglinde, Rachel Nicholls, has herself sung Brünnhilde on the small stage at Longborough; but her touching, well projected vignette here suggested that she might handle the larger role on this much bigger platform just as well.The Valkyries were vocally a superb line-up, visually as well, if not entirely in the best sense: too many to list but without obvious musical weakness. Whoever allowed them to process in during the orchestral introduction got up to the nines and carrying their own music stands, like the streltsy in Khovanshchina bringing in their own execution blocks, should be consigned to Brünnhilde’s mountain-top without parole. One shouldn’t make fun of Wagnerian sopranos: they are too soft a target.Lothar Koenigs conducted a lucid, beautifully sustained performance. I’ve heard more thrilling sound from this orchestra, but their discipline and integration remained undented by being for once in full view, and I lost count of the fine details and exquisite moments in what is one of Wagner’s most delicately scored acts. This kind of listening is the greatest bonus of concert Wagner. It reminds me of Stravinsky who, when he went to Parsifal in Monte Carlo in 1913, got himself a seat from which he could see nothing and hear everything. Sometimes those are the best seats.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/die-walk%C3%BCre-act-3-wno-koenigs-wales-millennium-centre-cardiff,5
334,"ATTHIS, Linbury Studio Theatre",ATTHIS,Linbury Studio Theatre,2015-04-24,alexandra Coghlan,"I do wish that arts institutions would stop using the word “immersive” when they simply mean “staged”. Just to be clear, there is nothing “immersive” about Netia Jones’s new staging of Georg Friedrich Haas's song-cycle ATTHIS at the Royal Opera House’s Linbury Studio, whatever the blurb may say. The director’s signature video projections, dance, song and music, come together to create an exquisite, hypnotic piece of very traditional theatre – not a promenade or a broken fourth wall in sight. And it’s all the better for it.Last seen taking over the Barbican for the psychedelic fantasy of imagination that was Unsuk Chin’s Alice In Wonderland, it’s good to see Jones working with simpler materials, distilling her restless creativity down to something cleaner, albeit no less meticulous. Painting with the endlessly flexible canvas of video – used here as an extension of the shadow-play of her lighting – Jones is a natural visual counterpart to Haas, whose microtonal music occupies the same range of shifting, incremental textures.It’s no exaggeration to say that Haas is working in a harmonic language all his own. While conventional Western music might employ a hundred or so pitches (if you consider the full range of all orchestral instruments), Haas’s opera Thomas demands no fewer than 1,600. The results are luminous and alien, texturally anchored in the familiar, the traditional, but stretched beyond any recognisable elastic limit of harmony.Haas’s Second String Quartet – a single, continuous gesture of a movement – actively engages in this playful conversation between tradition and experimentation. Here it is repurposed as the prologue to Haas’s 2009 song-cycle or monodrama for soprano and octet (scored, deliberately, as Schubert’s own) ATTHIS. Setting a sequence of fragmented texts by Sappho, the cycle pieces together a failed love affair between the poet and her beloved Atthis, whose name survives in various scraps of verse.The result is barely an hour of music-theatre, both light and rich. Jones’s monochrome set is dominated by a giant suspended moon (a nod, surely, to Pierrot Lunaire, lurking alongside Erwartung in ATTHIS’s frame of reference) – a sole point of stillness among shifting, living light, playing against the oil-slick of a floor and over the face and body of soprano Claire Booth, suspended above the stage.Jones takes Haas’s love-story-in-reverse (ATTHIS moves from abandonment and anger to memories of first passions) and mirrors it in her prologue. Two dancers (Laure Bachelot and Rachel Maybank) take the roles of Sappho and the young Atthis the Tadzio-esque object of her affection. We follow them from first meeting to violent parting, played out in a series of choreographic fragments, narrative miniatures echoing the fractured bursts of Haas’s music, the sudden shafts of melodic light that flash out among his microtonal slitherings.In the confrontingly small space of the Linbury it was a surprisingly polite, innocent courtship, rewritten later in soprano Claire Booth’s extraordinary performance into something altogether wilder and more elemental. Booth (pictured left and above) is an intensely watchable performer, responsible for translating so many contemporary works into emotional language an audience can understand. Here she tackled Haas’s extreme vocal writing with complete conviction, delivering what is often instrumental rather than vocal technique with awareness both of her role as another texture in the ensemble, and with the dramatic command demanded by this still, music-driven production.She is strongly supported by musicians from the London Sinfonietta, conducted sensitively by Pierre Andre Valade.Haas and Jones’s collaboration is a beautiful one, tender with humanity while chafing hard at the emotions. It makes the recent announcement of a mainstage opera for Haas at the Royal Opera next season (Morgen und Abend) all the more exciting – another chance to see this arch musical manipulator and dramatist at play.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/atthis-linbury-studio-theatre,4
335,"Jenůfa, Scottish Opera",Jenůfa,Scottish Opera,2015-04-19,Christopher Lambton,"Even at the tragic heart of Janáček's Jenůfa there is ambiguity. As the Kostelnička or village sacristan takes her stepdaughter Jenůfa’s baby boy outside to drown it in the icy river, you cannot quite be sure whether she is motivated by pride, fear or her love for Jenůfa. In this poised new co-production by Scottish Opera and Danish National Opera, there is no doubt that she is driven by love. Murderous it may be, and it will nearly destroy her, but her compassion cannot be denied. Likewise, when Laca, jealous of Jenůfa's love for another man, slashes at her face with his newly whetted knife, his intention is unclear, but the love that delineates his actions is transparent.Under the direction of Danish National Opera’s artistic director Annilese Miskimmon, this Jenůfa becomes a sober reflection on the ghastly power of misguided love. Aided by a lyrical interpretation of the score by conductor Stuart Stratford, the acting is exemplary, the situations believable. Where the Kostelnička can seem harsh and Števa, the man whom Jenůfa loves, boorish, no opportunity is lost to lend grace and charm to characters traditionally regarded with distaste.It helps that the setting is simple. A plain black curtain rises on a perfect little white cottage sitting in the middle of a large circle. The cottage belongs more to the Lake District than Scotland – actually the programme notes suggest that Ireland in 1918 is the intended location – but it forms a suitable backdrop to the largely amiable antics of Act One. By making her chorus of 40 surge around the cottage and in and out of its doors the director makes it seem, through busyness, larger than it really is. We meet Jenůfa, portrayed with great realism by Lee Bisset, along with her rival lovers: Laca, stern and upright, sung by Peter Wedd, and the flightier and somewhat lighter-voiced Števa, sung by Sam Furness. When the Kostelnička, admirably portrayed by Kathryn Harries (pictured below), silences the boisterous celebrations, we get a taste of a voice that later in the opera will develop into an instrument of destructive power.For the second act, the stage is made to look as though the circle has revolved – in fact it hasn’t – and the cottage’s walls folded out to reveal a doll’s house arrangement of a large comfortable kitchen and an attic bedroom above. Lit by candles, the setting is dim but cosy, as if to accentuate the mother-daughter-baby bond that you would expect in a household where the arrival of the child has successfully been kept a secret for months. But the lighting also anticipates the darkness that is to come. The colours fade and the shadows deepen as the Kostelnička wrestles with her conscience and suddenly realises that by killing the baby she can solve all her problems. In Harries’s stunning performance we can see the desperate intensity of conflicting emotions, as she realises that her only salvation lies in an act of unmitigated evil. Jenůfa wakes from a drugged sleep to find her baby missing. Bisset is tremendous here, in a prolonged soliloquy that moves from love through hope to an uneasy calm when she discovers that the child is dead.The use of the same setting for Act Three is doubtless a useful economy for a company always slightly strapped for cash, but it also makes perfect sense dramatically. While being in no sense mean, the walls of the cottage create a small acting area, focusing the drama in a way that can be difficult on the huge stage of Edinburgh’s Festival Theatre. Janáček’s music is never less than compelling throughout, but in the final act it rises to a shattering climax as the Kostelnička, guilty by her own admission of infanticide, is propelled from the warmth of the cottage into the darkness outside.This is a simple and rewarding production. Nothing seems out of place or superfluous, yet a host of tiny details lend credibility to the acting. Smoke curls from the cottage chimney all through Act One – in the next act a fire burns in Jenůfa’s bedroom. But most telling of all is the closing tableau. Jenůfa, exhausted, declares that she must leave, but Laca persuades her that they should try and face the future together, and in so doing walks tentatively across the room with a cup of tea. Curtain. A normally reticent Edinburgh audience cheered long and loud – an accolade well deserved.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/jenufa-scottish-opera,4
336,"The Pirates of Penzance, Touring",The Pirates of Penzance,Touring,2015-04-18,David Nice,"When does a Gilbert and Sullivan chorus make you laugh, cry and cheer as much as any of the famous set pieces? In this case when Major-General Stanley’s daughters “climbing over rocky mountain” wear pretty white dresses but turn out to be gym-trained showboys from the waist up, with their very own hair. That’s already one extra dimension to an operetta gem, but there’s so much more to enjoy around the crisp delivery of Gilbert’s undimmed lyrics.After plentiful touring, not least to Cate Blanchett’s Sydney Theatre, the business of Sasha Regan’s All-Male The Pirates of Penzance, to give this pionnering production its full title, has had time to develop. It never stops, but never takes away from the classical genius of the piece.Indeed, there are times when the surreal comedy is hyper-Pythonesque. To take just one of many examples, Regan has taken a cue from a single line of the Major-General’s song – the desperation with which he looks around for a rhyme with “strategy” and comes up with “sat a gee” – to give him a broom as a hobby-horse. Cuddly piratical maid-of-all-work Ruth – the consummate Alex Wetherhilll (pictured above with Samuel Nunn's Frederic and Neil Moors's Pirate King), who never has to work overtime for laughs  - approaches, frightens the ""horse"" but engages the broom with a carrot. You have to be there. But you may take it from me, who’ve sat unsmiling through the grim forced business of Scottish Opera’s Pirates and the desperate ploys for laughs of the Finborough Princess Ida, the constant invention formulated between Regan and her wonderful choreographer Lizzie Gee never palls. The dances around the main events sometimes bring the proceedings to a halt amid gales of laughter, but the message of music and text always gets across.We know from her oddly touching and magical Iolanthe in Wilton’s Music Hall that Regan does G&S the service of taking it seriously when pathos or splendour are at hand. Here the absolute coup with which the entire company, a cappella, hail “Poetry, thou heaven-born maid"" is delivered with such glorious, full-voiced harmony that you get the reference immediately – the Nurembergers’ salute to Hans Sachs in Act Three of Die Meistersinger. If the ENO Chorus in Mike Leigh’s forthcoming production handle it half as well as this team, they’ll have earned their laurels again.The special delight of it all is that although many of us have been through this all-male Savoy style before – and I wondered if the magic was wearing off in the company’s HMS Pinafore, probably because it was lost in the spaces of the Hackney Empire while the Richmond Theatre is just right – it still comes up amazingly fresh. Like the twists of the plot, which are still funny no matter how often you’ve seen Pirates – and I still think novices might be rather surprised by the leap-year gag, so I won’t spoil it in any detail – many of the faces are familiar and yet newly engaging. Alan Richardson, soprano lead, is so singular, with a falsetto that you think is going to be a bit squeaky but which opens up amazingly at the top. His artistry and ornamentations in a waltz-song better than many of the operatic examples it spoofs, “Poor Wandering One”, set an example any genuine prima donna would do well to emulate. The one true moment of pathos, “Ah, leave me not to pine”, is also beautifully timed and phrased.Samuel Nunn, her Frederic, doesn’t yet have the same total confidence. He may not be the true lyric tenor who ought to grace the part, but his fresh face and goofy crooning are uniquely apt. Neil Moors’ Pirate King and Miles Western’s Major General deliver with crisp perfection, but this is one of those wonderful evenings where each and every one of the maidens, pirates and blue-shirted policemen with moustaches on sticks (pictured above) has the chance to make you laugh, and their musical timing is beautifully supported by lone pianist David Griffiths. Against the handsome economy of Robyn Wilson’s designs – coat-hanger clouds and adaptable crates in Act 1, plenty of ill meeting by torchlight in the moonshine of Act 2 – there’s never a slack moment.  A show to see not once but again and again.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/pirates-penzance-touring,4
337,"King Size, Theater Basel, Linbury Studio Theatre",King Size,Theater Basel,2015-04-15,David Nice,"A journey into dreams through songs from Dowland to The Kinks; a Swiss director who, Covent Garden’s Director of Opera Kasper Holten assures us, is “one of the most important European theatre artists”; a Norwegian chanteuse who, I assure you, is a performer of real originality. All that should add up to something just a little bit extraordinary, shouldn’t it? Sadly not. What I saw last night was the kind of thing I’d shrug off having chosen at random from offerings at the Edinburgh Fringe.Perhaps anticipation was misguided: buy into Christoph Marthaler’s reputation as “radical and renowned”, and you might expect, as I did, a visionary parallel to Robert Carsen’s giant beds for his long-running production of Britten's A Midsummer Night’s Dream. What you see on entering the Linbury is a hotel room with fitted cupboards and floral wallpaper of repellent aspect, more fit for Ayckbourn than for avant-garde. That means the participants – two crooners, one doubling as a very accomplished keyboard master (Bendix Dethleffsen), said chanteuse Tora Augestad, and a senior actress – have to work all the harder with the lights up to make their mildly surreal moods and deeds register. The audience doesn’t know where to laugh; it’s not edgy, just tentative. Is this perhaps Swiss humour?The idea is a kind of dreamsong sequence the Germans might call a Traumliederabend. The realistically tasteless room happens to have three sets of occupants simultaneously. The future pianist is getting up at the start and sings a promising old canon about the ""golden sun"" with a haunting offstage voice (Augestad’s). The two singers listed as “King’s Daughter” and “King’s Son” (Michael von der Heide) come on as servants making up the bed and then get into it, uneasy non-sleepers and non-touchers. The older woman – a deadpan, battered-looking Nikola Weisse – crosses the stage repeatedly, recites broken poetry very quietly, fiddles with a music stand, clambers up a cupboard (pictured above, with von der Heide and Augestad) and eats spaghetti out of her handbag to a trio from the pink bathroom giving us the reconciliation music of Mozart’s Marriage of Figaro (I did laugh at that odd juxtaposition).If forced to draw a theme from this random selection, you might come up with alienation played out against love-music – most “ironically” the solitary lady’s actions to Wagner's Tristan Prelude and Mahler’s Adagietto – which finally declares itself in the last two numbers, Augestad’s strong delivery of a distressing Berg Lied and a folksong about death and the king’s children which fades effectively to near-inaudibility. When that’s intended, the very quiet delivery is a virtue. But for once I was crying out for mikes elsewhere: these aren't opera singers, after all, though Dethleffsen's consummate pianism highlights remarkable harmonies in Schumann and a real gem, ""Sonny Boy"" as immortalised by Al Jolson. Still, without amplification, energy levels seem low even in the predictably parodied pop songs. Von der Heide’s joke dancing and the repeated gag about artists in the limelight losing their poise aren’t funny for more than a moment, if that’s the intention.Above all, besides loud and soft and the contrast of idioms, there’s no intuitive shape to the sequence. If it’s meant to be dispiriting, then it works. But even the Linbury, as stubbornly unatmospheric as ever, seems too big for such a musical offering. Bring back Augestad by all means, miked in an evening of Weill with the fabulous Norwegian five-piece ensemble band where she’s first among equals, Music for a While. But on this evidence I wouldn’t bank on a large-scale Marthaler production going down any better in the main house than recent flops from Martin Kušej (Idomeneo), Katharina Thoma (Un ballo in maschera) and John Fulljames (Mahagonny). I’m an admirer of Holten and his affable leadership, but he needs to come up with something special soon.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/king-size-theater-basel-linbury-studio-theatre,2
338,"Between Worlds, ENO, Barbican",Between Worlds,ENO,2015-04-12,Jessica Duchen,"Composer Tansy Davies and librettist Nick Drake’s opera Between Worlds cannot help but be a devastating tribute to the tragedy of 9/11. Yet the whole is peppered with problems that mean this result is achieved only intermittently. Davies – whose first opera this is – and the playwright Drake, with Deborah Warner directing, have picked a topic that would seem at first glance to demand the scale of a modern-day Götterdämmerung. The result they extrapolate is far from that – but when it does succeed, it is in ways that are not really about 9/11 at all.This is, essentially, the final section, in which the emotional intensity escalates towards the inevitable. Here the work approaches in earnest the spheres that music alone can evoke, beyond the capabilities of words and even of ideas: the agony of losing loved ones. You would have to have the proverbial stone heart to emerge from the final choral lament without feeling wrung out. The long silence as the chorus filed away in darkness, but for the candles they carried, was a fine tribute to the work, and some members of the audience were visibly devastated.Nevertheless, Götterdämmerung it is not. As a meditative lament on this human tragedy, Between Worlds succeeds. But as a metaphysical drama of the day itself, there is more to question, and much to clarify.The action takes place on three levels: at the top, the Shaman is the counter-tenor-as-figure-from-elsewhere (which unfortunately has become a contemporary operatic trope). In the middle are the four nameless protagonists and the Janitor. At the bottom, the chorus, from whom those left behind emerge: a mother, a lover, a sister, a naughty child. Images of New York are projected onto what seems at first a textured backdrop, but consists of myriad sheets of paper, which become variously – depending on Tai Yarden’s video design and Jean Kalman’s excellent lighting – the windows of the World Trade Center, the messages sent home, the building that collapses.But the four protagonists, each leaving a home situation unresolved as they head to their meeting in the North Tower, are under-developed; we learn little about each of them, or whether they have ever met before. The singers – Clare Presland, Rhian Lois, Willian Morgan and Philip Rhodes – do the best they can with what they have; the young woman is in love with another young woman, the young man is scared of heights, and so forth, but the drama feels undercooked and remains difficult to buy into. The Janitor, strongly characterised and projected by Eric Greene (pictured above in the centre with Lois, Rhodes, Presland and Morgan) is the most powerful figure; it is his task to convince the terrified meeting-goers to call their loved ones to make final declarations of love and regret.If the Shaman (splendid singing from Andrew Watts nothwithstanding) has a role in these interactions, its significance is not coming across. The programme tells us that he becomes the Janitor’s ""spirit guide""– but for those of us not especially conversant with what spirit guides do, this isn’t going to help and the action on stage offers too little clue – perhaps because the split levels allow no actual contact between them. Likewise, if the Janitor’s wife has died, as extraneous information suggests, one could experience the whole evening without realising this from what we see and hear.The balance seems a bit skewed – at times too naturalistic (“Oh my God”… “What the fuck was that?) and at other times too little so, yet without offering the original poetry the topic seems to ache for, breaking into the Biblical, the liturgical or other languages instead: at heightened moments the Shaman utters some Latin, the Janitor Spanish, the chorus words from the Requiem Mass, the characters psalms. “Out of the deep” – when they are high up in the North Tower? We know it’s meant metaphorically, but still…In the ghastly reality of 9/11 the place would have been mayhem – there would have been smoke, dust, screaming, flames, desperate temperatures. Yet everything unfolds as if in slow motion, with fluttering papers representing the tumbling South Tower, feeling a tad underwhelming; even the characters ask what that was. The mismatch between too-literal words and over-stylised action leaves a gaping gap that the music cannot quite bridge.The action gets off to a slow start, which is serious as the whole thing is barely one and a half hours longDavies’s orchestration is atmospheric and the harmonies and textures of the music build tension effectively: high, hypnotic harps, layers of keening strings, the voice-percussion of the Shaman, and bitter, ironic suggestions of telephones are just some of its eerie effects. Many of Davies’s purely instrumental works have a gritty, distinctive, dusky-hued style with a galvanising propulsiveness and fragmented lines functioning in dizzy counterpoint; yet here her high energy feels somehow squished by the strictures of words and voices; the piece might benefit from a greater variety of musical pace.The structural balance could also benefit from some delicate adjustment. The action gets off to a slow start, which is serious as the whole thing is barely one and a half hours long. Yet the emotional heart of the work arrives when the Young Man’s Mother, gloriously sung by Susan Bickley, offers an outpouring of sorrow in which she declares that there is nothing in this world and time but love; this vital episode is over in what feels like a trice.Bickley is a marvel in every respect, holding the stage with her sheer presence. Around her there unfolds a terrific team effort: the ENO chorus in magnificent shape, the small orchestra valiant and well balanced by conductor Gerry Cornelius, some haunting aerial choreography by Kim Brandstup and superb vignettes from the secondary characters, notably Sarah Champion as the Younger Woman’s Lover and Edward Green as the Realtor’s naughty child who won’t eat his breakfast (convincingly real kids are in short supply as operatic characters, and this one is terrific).It would be very, very hard for any work to live up to the demands of this topic. But once you realise the piece isn’t necessarily about 9/11, at heart, but an aspect of the human condition that is intangible, universal and desperately painful to face, you may get past the structural issues, the lack of clarity and the somewhat monochrome pace. Davies at times reaches that place of emotional embodiment that only music can capture, and wraps it in a dark yet cathartic embrace.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/between-worlds-eno-barbican,3
339,"Swanhunter, Opera North, Linbury Studio Theatre",Swanhunter,Opera North,2015-04-05,alexandra Coghlan,"There was a moment half-way through Jonathan Dove’s children’s opera Swanhunter when I suddenly realised why pantomime developed its convention of the principal boy. Having a grown man prancing and posturing boyishly for the entertainment of a room full of kids feels odd, affected somehow, distorting the simplicity and sincerity of the tale being told. Which is a shame when, as here, the theatrical trappings are so vivid and enticing.Premiered by Opera North in 2009, Swanhunter is now – in a rare vote of confidence for a new work – getting a second outing from the company, in a fresh touring co-production with The Wrong Crowd, directed by Hannah Mulder. Mulder supplements the cast of six with a stylish collections of puppets – think less The Sooty Show and more War Horse or Japanese Bunraku – which help bring the more fantastical elements of this Finnish legend to life.The story is simple (give or take a little wizardy and some dismemberment). Lemminkäinen is a charming young thug determined to “catch” a wife. For reasons that are unclear, the only candidates he’ll consider come from the North, so armed with his Ladybird Guide to Women he leaves his mother behind and sets off. But there are conditions to acquiring these North Women, and Lemminkäinen must complete a series of impossible tasks before one may be his. Falling at the final hurdle, he is killed and dismembered (very tastefully) by Death, before the song of his mother magically restores him to life and health. Whether he ever gets the girl or not, however, remains tantalisingly unknown.Using just six instruments, Jonathan Dove’s score is a gorgeous musical mongrel, taking its soundworld from Baltic folk music, captured in accordion and fiddle-style violin playing, but adding the rhythmic impetus of a drum-kit, some gravitas with a horn, and a strong kick of jazz from the double bass. When the narrative threatens to sag, the score’s propulsive energy and character – developed in a series of recurring motifs – step in to support. The vocal writing is distinctive and effective, using a quartet of campers as a vocal backdrop for the virtuosic outpourings of both Mother (Ann Taylor, in glorious voice, carving through Dove’s richly textured vocal lines) and Lemminkäinen (a poised Adrian Dywer) himself.The quartet of campers all step forward in turn as soloists, taking on the roles of Lemminkäinen’s various foes. There’s strong work from Matthew Hargreaves and Christopher Diffey, and Rebecca Afonwy-Jones makes a wonderfully imperious and rich-toned Louhi. But it’s Suzanne Shakespeare’s Swan that stands apart, gifted with an extraordinary vocalise of an aria by Dove, soaring higher above the stave than any Swan ever managed with complete control and purity of tone.Canning’s puppets, however, are the stars here. Her Devil’s horse pacing and prancing with real force, and Death himself a menacing, long-fingered creature. There’s an analogue charm to this production that deliberately defies any expectations of a digital age, proving that children don’t need complexity to be utterly absorbed. The young audience members at this polished performance – a dress-rehearsal in all but name, thanks to issues caused by the Holborn fire – all seemed entranced.As an adult I wasn’t quite as convinced, troubled by the rather lofty quality of Alasdair Middleton’s libretto, which doesn’t give an inch in its treatment of such unfamiliar material (this is definitely a production for children over 10), and by a lack of satisfying arc to a drama that ends in mid-air. But the score is a delight, working all the magic needed.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/swanhunter-opera-north-linbury-studio-theatre,3
340,"Sweeney Todd, London Coliseum",Sweeney Todd,London Coliseum,2015-04-01,David Nice,"Still they keep coming, 35 years on from the London premiere of Sondheim's ""musical thriller"": Sweeneys above pubs, in pie shops, concert halls and theatres of all sizes, on the big screen, Sweeneys with symphony orchestras, two pianos or a handful of instruments wielded by the singers, Sweeneys as musicals and as operas, the dumpy and the tall. Which type was this one? Not a vintage English National Opera production, that much seems clear.A year after this more than semi-staging's Lincoln Centre unveiling with the New York Philharmonic, the ENO Orchestra is very much centre stage, a huge enticement since, for all the claustrophobic theatrical merits of Sweeney Todd in small spaces and studio theatres, nothing can compensate for the loss of Jonathan Tunick’s classic orchestration, raising Sondheim's score which is already halfway to Britten to the level of Peter Grimes. It’s in the voices that the less satisfactory half of ENO’s new musical theatre partnership, the GradeLinnit Company, seems to cue compromise. I have nothing but praise for the bright and mostly young show people who make up this ensemble. But there’s no reason why the resident chorus wouldn’t have done just as good a job, especially since director Richard Jones has shown us, above all in The Girl of the Golden West, that they can function vividly as individual characters.Nor is there any part in Sondheim’s darkest work of music-theatre which couldn’t be taken by a soloist in an opera company. Sure, this kind of mix can work just as well, but it involves one fatal flaw: amplification, and of the crudest sort which means that you can’t often pinpoint where the singer is coming from. Worst, it flattens out the rich colours in Bryn Terfel’s greatest of bass-baritones (pictured above).For nearly a decade now he’s been potentially the best Sweeney Todd since Len Cariou, and certainly the least hammy. But I stress the “potential” because I’ve not seen him work under a director who can fully unleash the inner demon. He begins plausibly as the most sullen and unfeely-touchy of escaped convicts; the stillness is a great virtue and brings this outsider closer to Terfel's Flying Dutchman (down to the same sort of coat as the one he wore, if memory serves, for the Zurich Opera's Wagner in concert). But something needs to snap when his one-time persecutor and rapist of his wife, Judge Turpin, slips from beneath his razor, and we get that only in the menacing, shot-silk voice. Director Lonny Price makes the fatal error in the epic “Epiphany” of having Terfel's Todd step down into a red-lit audience and threaten the front rows. Uneasy the laughter may be, but it’s still laughter, and it works against the Brechtian “distancing technique” engaged, sometimes rather cornily, elsewhere.Somehow the tension slips away partly because, to quote Into the Woods in quite a different context, people die but they don’t: barber’s-chair victims get up and walk off. The giant red hand that flashes at such moments of execution is partly successful; otherwise the stylisation could work but it doesn’t. Nor is the clash of modern dress with a barely underlined Victorian melodrama clearly delineated. For me, it gets off to a bad start: we all need the Gothic organ improvisation hair-raisingly interrupted by factory whistle before “The Ballad of Sweeney Todd” (later there’s a foghorn, not so scary). Price’s first gambit is his best: everyone comes on in evening dress, but rips it off, knocks over the flowers and turns a grand piano upside down, dropping it with a thwack. There are good gags throughout, but no new insights into any of the characters.Fortunately Emma Thompson (pictured below) knows exactly what to do, repeating little of the usual shtick and adding plenty of her own as capitalist Mrs Lovett who moves from popping pussies into pies and on, with Sweeney’s help, to people. The cockney accent, laced with ribbons of Dot Cotton, includes some magnificently pregnant phrase endings and boy, can she hold a pose. The timing, both musical and dialogue-wise, is flawless. Song-wise, she has a fine chest-voice but can’t take it quite as high as many show singers: what emerges above it is a trainable but fledgling mezzo. That doesn’t matter too much beyond “The Worst Pies in London”.Other accomplished near-operatics come from Philip Quast’s powerful Judge and John Owen-Jones’s cod-Italian tenor Pirelli; a full top C may not be in his armoury, but he turns that to good effect. Sweet heroine Johanna could do with more edge, and more lyric-soprano focus, than Katie Hall gives her; I’m not quite sure what voice the other juve lead, Matthew Seddon-Young, might be, but he has presence and style enough to carry off sailor Anthony's big number. There’s a well-pitched, for which read unembarrassing, Beggar Woman from Rosalie Craig, and Jack North’s Tobias would be perfect if he didn’t rely too much on the miking; a tad more energetic projection wouldn’t go amiss. Still, ""Nothing's Gonna Harm You"", in tandem with Thompson, is certainly a highlight.Is making the orchestra the centre of attention a good idea? The problem is that they’re dimmer behind the proscenium arch than they would be in the pit. It may be that which makes David Charles Abell’s conducting seem a little under-energised at times, but the ensemble is never less than tight and it probably speaks volumes for Abell's direction that nobody misses a beat (Terfel, who can memorise the whole of Wagner's Wotan, has slipped up with Sondheim's tricky entries in the past).Since – it needs to be stressed – this is a full rather than a semi-staging, there’s not much to be gained from the instrumental focus beyond a trombone being used as a mincer and a kettledrum as Mrs Lovett’s chopping table. But how poetically the instrumental colours tell, especially the solo strings led by ENO leader Janice Graham (a supremely queasy solo from her when Mrs Lovett sours Toby’s protective anthem). Sweeney’s best with its full complement of players, for me at least, and two charismatic leads, all of which it gets here; what a shame that the whole isn’t quite the sum of its very classy parts.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/sweeney-todd-london-coliseum,3
341,"Princess Ida, Finborough Theatre",Princess Ida,Finborough Theatre,2015-03-27,David Nice,"All Savoyards, whether conservative or liberal towards productions, have been grievously practised upon. They told us to expect the first professional London grappling with Gilbert and Sullivan’s eighth and, subject-wise, most problematic operetta in 20 years (23, if the reference is to Ken Russell’s unmitigated mess, one of English National Opera’s biggest disasters). Yet this is not Princess Ida as the pair would recognize it.In what turns out to be director Phil Wilmott’s “performing version”, the dramatis personae is essentially reduced by at least six characters of note, numbers are reallocated to the most unlikely singers, one of Sullivan’s three best quartets split into a solo and a duet, the components of a fine through-composed finale scattered about, and, worst of all, the plot of the original outer acts rewritten, with attendant pastiche Gilbertian dialogue.“A woman’s college? Maddest folly going!” exclaims puny scoffer Cyril, and were the writer not W S Gilbert, one would hesitate to attach the character's views to his creator. But there we have it: the nub of the piece is a satire on women’s education, and there’s not much anyone can do to soften it.That said, the original does offer some room for ambiguity: Ida has set up her establishment with the highest of aims, and Sullivan gives her some of his loftiest music. I rather hoped to see a production in which the men are medieval lunks, the women enlightened 20th-century tutors and undergraduates. This is not it. Take away the spirit of enterprise, have Ida walled up among the gels by lustful guardian and Lord Protector (not King) Gama (Simon Butteriss pictured below) – more Iolanthe Lord Chancellor than crabby old regent – and a new muddle ensues.So would it work for, say, anyone who didn’t know anything about the original? Well, the pace is lively enough, but the execution of movement and dialogue often lacks focus or conviction; there was all too little laughter in the audience last night, and I’m sure that’s not Gilbert’s fault when the dialogue gags happen to be his (in iambic pentameters throughout, no less). The girls are mostly better than the lads. Though no lyric-dramatic pillar of assurance, Bridget Costello’s Ida is genuinely sweet in melting mood. Her duet with Zac Wancke’s Hilarion –  also fetching, but a crooner rather than the tenor which Sullivan’s writing really demands – almost convinced me that the snippeting up of “The world is but a broken toy” could be justified.Not much else can, to be honest – certainly not the appropriation of Lady Psyche’s song about Darwinian man by Butteriss’s Gama. The striptease to what should be Arac’s Handelian pastiche “This helmet, I suppose”, like most of what he has to do, just isn’t funny. I got the sense that this accomplished performer believed in the new character almost as little as I did. Let Gama be a misanthrope pure and simple with two numbers in the outer acts; that’s enough.What’s to praise? Richard Baker and Nick Barstow work their socks off on two rather tinny-sounding electric pianos, while Maira Vazeou’s set designs make the best use of the space, with Landseer’s Monarch of the Glen dominating a not especially masculine environment, and Alma-Tadema’s Ask Me No More suggested in the women’s grounds. There's some not bad business with a callipygous classical male torso, too.But the Grecian garb and chaplets only get further in the way of new lyrics about the right to vote (applied to a number usually axed, ""Come, mighty Must""). I did smile at the end, where Sapphism takes over the “college” and two chaps are joined in holy matrimony. But the simple fact remains: if you don’t trust the material, leave it alone. The Union Theatre’s all-male Iolanthe and Charles Court Opera’s fizzing recent Ruddigore set the bar for having novel fun with G&S while fundamentally respecting its workability. This attempt comes nowhere close.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/princess-ida-finborough-theatre,2
342,"Amadis de Gaule, UCL Opera",Amadis de Gaule,UCL Opera,2015-03-26,Matthew Wright,"Johann Christian Bach’s Amadis de Gaule, which is receiving its first London run this week in a vivid and charming production at University College London Opera this week, suffered like many a talented work from the blinkered whims of musical fashion. History has generally focused on more pressing issues in late 18th-century Paris than the operatic rivalry between the schools of Gluck and Piccinni, but Bach’s failure to please either faction along with the minor disturbances of 1789 has, it’s believed, caused the subsequent neglect of this poignant and sensuous piece.It’s a curiously mixed work, and some audience bewilderment is understandable. The story derives originally from a chivalric romance of medieval Spanish origin, later adapted several times for the stage, and there’s a slightly jarring sense of historical mismatch about its production, like a time-lapse photograph taken over several centuries. Musically, Bach feels pretty up-to-date: there’s a convincing appearance of through-composition for much of the piece, while adventurous use of instrumental colour and harmonic invention both look ahead to the psychological realism of classical opera. At its best it combines passages of stately Handelian melody with intimate Mozartian sensuousness, in a chamber piece of genuinely heart-wrenching romance that would ornament the programme of any summer garden festival.  The plot, however, is several centuries behind, tangled in off-puttingly allegorical thickets, and proceeding by turns with ponderous circumlocution then bewildering rapidity. The tale of knight-errant Amadis, his love for Oriane, bitter rivalry with Arcalaüs and entanglement with Arcalaüs’ sister Arcabonne (whom he rescued, having killed their brother Ardan Canil) belongs wholeheartedly to the late Middle Ages. Director Jack Furness does his best to bring it up to date with a set bestrewn with war-torn sheets of corrugated iron, while shards dangle from above.Yet neither the rusty shelters nor the guerilla-casual costumes can modernise allegorical scenes featuring the characters of Hate, Discord and the healing Urgande (sporting a Christ-like crown of thorns), and Amadis is probably best taken on its own terms, as a kind of magical romance. The piece’s many charms include a choral ensemble of ravishing sensuality at the end of Act One, describing Amadis’ emasculating vision of Oriane. It was depicted here with what more frivolous publications than theartsdesk might describe as girl-on-girl action in the chorus, more than sufficient to ensure a capacity house and many a misted-up opera glass. As a work of fantastical romance, it’s no less plausible, and in parts even more entrancing, than many established works; as an attempt at bitter, gritty realism, it’s irredeemably quaint.   UCL Opera has long championed young professional singers, and in Alice Privett and Nicholas Morris, it has two compelling young talents. Privett was exquisitely tender in her phrasing of Oriane’s distress, while Morris’ Arcalaüs, a violent bully, was depicted with bristling, full-throated dynamism. The chorus (pictured right), wholly amateur and very large, was in lush voice throughout, their size perhaps excessive, though never overwhelming, and their tone nevertheless delicate. Conductor Charles Peebles massaged the orchestra’s lyrical and idiomatic phrasing with aplomb, extracting maximum expression from his student forces. Only in the more exposed string passages were there moments of technical fragility, as the wispy, yearning upper strings yielded an occasionally sour note.UCL Opera has been performing neglected works annually since 1951, its inclusive mission of supporting young singers and expanding the repertoire a hugely valuable one in a musical scene not generally known for its inclusivity. This year’s piece falls somewhere between the ambitiousness of 2001’s Kullervo and the early, journeyman Verdi that has featured perhaps too often in the past. A commentary on the situation in Ukraine it certainly isn’t, but see it one summer’s day, in a fragrant garden, and you will be captivated.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/amadis-de-gaule-ucl-opera,3
343,"Giove in Argo, Britten Theatre, Royal College of Music",Giove in Argo,Britten Theatre,2015-03-25,David Nice,"If you’re looking for rare festival Handel, better a pasticcio – take that as shorthand for a cut-and-paste job mostly from previous hits – than one of those original operas in which the composer only goes through the motions (and I’ve heard a few). Call in a reasonably cutting-edge director, make sure you have a motivator of the calibre of Laurence Cummings in the pit – not difficult in this instance, since he’s the devoted force behind the London Handel Festival – and find the brightest and best of young singers.Which this sextet from the RCM International Opera School plus chorus certainly were on the first occasion where I’ve been to a production with students in the leads and never once thought, ""What did their teachers think they were up to?"" What’s more, I saw the second-night cast – which certainly doesn’t mean the B team. That these superb singers were so confident and physically animated surely had much to do with Cummings’ ever-buoyant support conducting a razor-sharp London Handel Orchestra and with a director, James Bonas, who knew what he was doing.In this first UK performance since the 1739 premiere, we got not the advertised pretty pastoral of nymphs and shepherds in sylvan glades, into which Jupiter descends and pursues two of his amours with no prospect of the usual metamorphoses, but a very dark forest of climbing-post trees in which crazy, mixed-up characters arrived to be messed with still further. Well, that’s one up for a start on Glyndebourne’s misconceived staging of Mozart’s La finta giardiniera, where the wild wood became a crumbling palatial room and the plot incomprehensible.There’s not, as often in Handel, much to this one, though the outcomes before the presumed happy ending see one of Jupiter’s loves, Iside – very loosely based on Io – go mad and the other, Calisto, await execution for betraying goddess Diana’s rules. That’s enough for Bonas to contravene the programme observation of Handel scholar John H Roberts, who reconstructed the opera and provided the music for the text of the secco recitatives, that “nothing is supposed to be taken very seriously”. Iside’s path to madness includes some vicious physical abuse from her fiancé Osiri and reconciliation isn’t for her at the end (does the shower of gold, though, hint at Jupiter’s next love, Danae?). Early on, there are some witty touches, like Iside’s enchantment by the forest-stalking Giove and the way he levitates her for seduction (a wry homage, perhaps, to the suspensions of Peter Brook’s classic A Midsummer Night’s Dream).It’s clear from the start that everyone will have a huge amount of stylized business to remember as they sing, starting with a hard-working chorus (pictured above) which takes a while to warm to its task but eventually produces one of the evening’s greatest pleasures, the gorgeous polyphonic number derived from a cantata trio which ends the second act, delivered from different points around the auditorium as a manifestation of Iside’s insanity.The business with Diana putting on her massive, antelope-horned headdress didn’t quite work (and her lanterns were a bit crumpled-looking, too): He Wu (pictured left with Galina Averina's Calisto and Gyula Rab's Giove) seemed nervous about it to start with, but went on to deliver several showpieces with steely aplomb and ringing top notes. Those latter seemed the only items lacking in Hungarian tenor Gyula Rab’s armoury as Giove, but there’s time to work on them. He has perfect lyric-tenor style and feline sex appeal in his physicality which, as Bonas obviously intended, allied him more to a mixture of Oberon and Puck than to the Graeco-Roman god. Brute testosterone came from the Erasto/Osiri of Timothy Nelson, a baritone to watch.Two excellent leading ladies appeared in close succession. No doubt about it, Kezia Bienek had star quality from the start, a disciplined stage animal with a finely-controlled metal about the voice which marked her out not so much as the advertised mezzo – though she certainly has the lower register – but as a potential ideal for Mozart’s Elettra and Donna Anna (invocation of furies and grief over a dead father simply underlined the resemblances). Indeed, one of the few new pieces of writing for the premiere, a magnificent recitativo accompagnato for Iside’s first mad scene, comes closer to Mozart than anything else I’ve heard in Handel. Bienek, Cummings and the orchestra between them also persuaded us that the two interpolated arias by one Francesco Araja were well up to the mark of Handel in full spate.Galina Averina’s Calisto was going to take time to emerge from Bienek’s shadow, but Handel gives his nymph two proven showstoppers – Alcina’s “Tornami a vagheggiar” and “Combattuta da piu venti” from Faramondo – and Avernina sang both with true Handelian-soprano panache. Much depends in the faster numbers on the perfect mood set by orchestra and conductor, and though Giove in Argo contains no fancy instrumentation, the strings proved endlessly resourceful and varied. Even my worry that only one double-bass isn’t enough to make Handel rock vanished as Pippa Macmillan provided the percussion as well as the heft. This is what the operatic Handel is all about: endless pleasure, lashings of energy and a touch of pathos. In every respect, this team did him proud. It’s so good that you could go twice – once for each cast",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/giove-argo-britten-theatre-royal-college-music,4
344,"Madama Butterfly, Royal Opera",Madama Butterfly,Royal Opera,2015-03-21,David Nice,"When is a famous aria more than just a showpiece? When it’s a narrative of a future event conjured by a hope beyond reason, which is what Madama Butterfly’s “Un bel dì” (“One fine day”) ought to be but so rarely is: too often prima donna overkill and stereotyped mannerisms get in the way. Not with Latvian soprano Kristine Opolais. Her Butterfly’s gestures can be stylised but always unusual, setting her apart, an ex-dancing geisha driven almost mad in a three-year wait for a “husband” who won’t come back. The effort of will sees her crumple in the aftermath of her vision.Opolais (pictured below in Act One) makes every word tell especially in the crystal-clear middle range. The tone can curdle in the higher reaches, but only when she doesn’t use her exciting lirico spinto resources, which are vibrant if not incandescent. But her Italianate style has all the artistry of Mirella Freni and Renata Scotto, and this Butterfly is a complete and multi-hued creation.The urgency and detail are perfectly mirrored in Nicola Luisotti’s conducting, as perfect in pace and colour as a Puccini performance possibly can be. That’s saying something when the house Puccinian, Antonio Pappano, has until now seemed to have no peer, and when Opolais’s husband, Andris Nelsons, one of the conducting world’s greatest hopes at the moment, shared her triumph back in 2011. But I really can’t remember this masterpiece among opera scores – as perfect, in its own compressed way, as anything by Wagner – ever having its many diamond facets so finely buffed.Even a single shadowy note held by two double basses can chill the blood as all illusions are stripped away and Butterfly finally realises that not only will the “Yankee vagabondo”, B F (as in bloody fool) Pinkerton, who married her on a short lease and a libido-driven whim, won’t be returning but also that his new wife wants to take Butterfly’s blond-haired, blue-eyed child back to America with them. At this frozen point in the action, all audience coughing is stilled and you can hear a pin drop.On a superficial level, it’s also worth noting about this extraordinary scene what a wonderful thing the operatic world is when three fine singers who happen to be Latvian, Albanian and Armenian share a stage singing Italian: they are, respectively, Opolais, Enkelejda Shkosa, whose big-hearted maid Suzuki shows that she’s big of voice, too, when she emerges horror-struck from the shadow of her mistress, and Anush Hovhannisyan, who can’t possibly make much of a vocal mark as Kate Pinkerton but, as those of us who saw her in Chelsea Opera’s Le Roi de Lahore know, is a diva who won't have to wait long for her moment in the sun.The males of the “American” species are stalwart but relatively uninvolving. Brian Jagde’s heavyweight tenor is well contrasted at the start with the lighter sound of Carlo Bosi, luxury casting in the cameo role of the odious marriage-broker Goro, and he hits all the high notes with full-blooded energy. But there needs to be more in the way of sunshine and roses in the voice if we’re to find him an attractive bounder (the hard-hitting supertitles spare us nothing of Pinkerton’s insensitivity from the start). Gabriele Viviani’s baritone could be smoother, and not enough of Consul Sharpless’s sympathy comes across in another slightly stiff performance, but again it’s perfectly serviceable. Their trio with Suzuki is a glowing highlight.At least both men look good in uniform and stylish suits (pictured left), Agostino Cavalca’s costumes perfectly in tune with Christian Fenouillat's clean and handsome set, a bare wooden space to emphasise the performers, with screens and shutters lifting to reveal diverse backdrops: a sepia-tinted Nagasaki, garden flowers for Butterfly and Suzuki to gather, and, best of all, a blooming Japanese idyll which collapses to reveal Butterfly’s vengeful uncle the Bonze (Jeremy White), alarming against black. Moshe Leiser and Patrice Caurier have every reason to remain proud of their work in the hands of skilful revival director Justin Way: from high in the Royal Opera House, the groupings for the wedding look ravishing and Christophe Forey’s lighting highlights the mood (I’m especially fond of the yellow strips against purple for the Act One love duet).The only idea which doesn’t quite come off is Cio-Cio San’s lepidopteral fluttering after her hara-kiri, an unfortunate end to an otherwise shattering denouement. But production, singing and orchestral beauty come together exquisitely in scenes such as Butterfly’s vigil with her little son (Oliver Zetterström on the first night, clearly delighted to be in the show as he bounced up and down in the curtain call). Anthony Minghella’s far more compromised ENO Butterfly committed the outrage of an interval at the end of the Humming Chorus, but here the tableau of the waiting women holds and the intermezzo which follows shows Luisotti’s conducting mastery at its most supple. We’re spellbound to the end, lost in another world that turns out to be harsh and pitiless, and you come out (at least I did) disoriented and stricken. You can’t ask more from Puccini’s far from sentimental ending than that.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/madama-butterfly-royal-opera-0,4
345,"The Wild Man of the West Indies, ETO, Hackney Empire",The Wild Man of the West Indies,ETO,2015-03-13,alexandra Coghlan,"“Do you think they’ve got enough plot to get us through to the end?” I overheard a lady anxiously asking her husband during the interval. It was a fair question. Donizetti’s The Wild Man of the West Indies was written within a year of L’elisir d’amore, and the two operas share many things, but not that spark of genius that can transform a pantomime into a drama. Rarely has so little happened in an opera, and with even less effect.Which makes it all the more baffling that the imaginative and usually so reliable English Touring Opera would tackle it. General director James Conway is quoted in the programme as saying he only chooses works he thinks the company “have a good chance of doing very well”. I’d argue that here the dice were thrown long before the company even started work on this production – the first, incidentally, in the UK in living memory.Derived from Cervantes’ Don Quixote, the story is simple enough, involving a Spanish nobleman turned mad through jealous rage, his philandering brother and his estranged wife, who all end up, in varying states of volition and undress, on the island of San Domingo. Here they abuse and bully the native population, while fighting, reconciling and narrowly avoiding a suicide pact.The trouble is that most of the action has already happened by the time the opera starts, so – with the exception of the Act II reunion scene between the mad Cardenio (Craig Smith) and Eleonora (Sally Smith) – most of the stage-business only serves to narrate the backstory. Which leaves the singers and chorus desperately searching for anything approximating function or intent, all the while trying hard not to be racist in this slavery-centric context. It’s all rather awkward.Although Florence de Mare’s lovely set – rearing up at the back, part wave, part ship –  and Mark Howland’s evocative lighting give the action every chance, director Iqbal Khan can’t seem to make the scene work. Time and again on the Hackney Empire’s compact stage, characters barely a metre apart spend lengthy episodes “not noticing” one another or colliding for comic effect. Perhaps if the score were stronger or more certain of itself none of this would matter, but this is Donizetti by the yard. And with the exception of Fernando’s Act II aria (nicely sung by Nicholas Sharratt) the music barely troubles itself with the mood or the emotion of the action underway.Conway speaks passionately about the opera’s psychology, and there’s no faulting the potential of a story that plays games with sanity and madness and chooses an elderly, complicated bass for its hero rather than a glossy young tenor. Unfortunately Donizetti makes little of his material, and there’s nothing that comes even close to equalling the mad scene of Lucia or the emotional truthfulness of L’elisir.Smith (pictured left with Silver) delivers a fine performance loaded with character and inner life. His carefully judged understatement and Peter Braithwaite’s busy naturalism (as the put-upon Kaidama) contrast with Silver’s dramatic histrionics. Both she and Sharratt struggle to relax at the top of their voices, leading to some rather wayward musical climaxes. Conductor Jeremy Silver opts for sturdy tempos that could occasionally do with throwing caution to the wind.With determined work from the male chorus and plenty of energy from the cast, ETO just about get away with this show. But I for one won’t be heading back to San Domingo any time soon.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/wild-man-west-indies-eto-hackney-empire,2
346,"Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny, Royal Opera",Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny,Royal Opera,2015-03-11,Peter Quantrill,"""No heckling. No smoking. No making love,"" read the nifty video projections announcing the rise of the new Mahagonny at the Royal Opera House. Why so coy? Could they not give us a bang for our buck, or even a slow comfortable screw?But that would be indulgent, too much like fun, or even the ""culinary"" entertainment of conventional opera disparaged by Bertolt Brecht when he later distanced himself from the performing version of a libretto he had part-written, part-appropriated or rewritten from contemporary sources with the help of an assistant. Director John Fulljames and his team have aimed to keep Brechtian principles ever in view while bringing the imagined location of ""Amerika"" up to date, though it’s the singers who punch out Jeremy Sams’s new translation with exemplary clarity; there was mostly no need for the surtitles thanks to their efforts, and Mark Wigglesworth’s careful balancing of the large pit band/small orchestra for which Kurt Weill scored his show.What kind of show would that be? Brecht and Weill called it an opera, they wrote it for opera houses and operatic voices and yet their text and music jab away at both their audience and the pretensions and devices and suspensions they enjoy. Even the opera’s best-known number is brutally subverted here, being sung from the back of a truck by Jenny (Christine Rice, pictured right) while her fellow prostitutes clamber out to ply their trade in the new city of pleasure. Mahagonny’s materfamilias Leokadia Begbick, as costumed by Christina Cunningham and played by Anne Sofie von Otter, is one part Bet Lynch, two parts Jenny Eclair with a dash of White Dee. The best and worst that can be said is that you’d never know it was von Otter under that wig and with such frequent recourse to the microphone. In better vocal estate on the first night was Willard White, playing her right-hand man Trinity Moses as the Samuel L Jackson character that in retrospect seems his inevitable destiny. At her left was Peter Hoare’s Fatty, impressively suave throughout.But the real tenor on stage was Kurt Streit’s commanding anti-hero Jimmy McIntyre. ""Make love to me,"" pleads Jenny. ""No, I’m talking here,"" responds Jimmy in a fairly typical exchange as he lectures the citizens of Mahagonny on the virtues of Nietzchean self-fulfilment, this time delivered from the top of the truck that forms the entire set for Act 1. Those wondering at the interval whether Brecht and Weill needed to look quite so low-rent quickly found out where the budget had gone at the start of Act 2 with another towering Es Devlin spectacular, in gleeful contravention of the scenic austerity prescribed by Brecht and his designer Caspar Neher, built from shipping crates enclosing jazz-bands, whorehouses and the tangle of wires which eventually brings Jimmy’s life to a shocking end. More projections on to their surfaces show the Alaska which Jimmy and his comrades left, and a manifesto of slogans which become more doctrinaire as the piece does: we’re left with a kitsch crucifixion and a lot of shouting, both from the chorus and the staging.Those of us who want more from our evening at the opera than a lecture on the iniquities of religion, capitalism and man-made climate change could take real pleasure from the subtle evolution of Rice’s Jenny, who seized her moment in Act 2 with smouldering allure and grew with unBrechtian lusciousness into Jimmy’s cynically grieving widow. The mark of the piece, its problem and its relevance is that it hardly seems outrageous now as it did to audiences in 30s Germany: we live with Mahagonny, and strike our own bargains. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/rise-and-fall-city-mahagonny-royal-opera,4
347,"Alice in Wonderland, BBCSO, Brönnimann, Barbican",Alice in Wonderland,BBCSO,2015-03-09,alexandra Coghlan,"The Southbank Centre’s Women of the World Festival may have been the largest cultural event marking International Women’s Day 2015, but it wasn’t the most ambitious. Over at the Barbican two women were responsible for a multimedia opera staging whose spectacle, level of detail and sheer force of personnel involved was staggering.Premiered in 2007, Unsuk Chin’s Alice in Wonderland has already had more outings than most contemporary operas. You could attribute this to the endless appeal of Lewis Carroll’s story, but it also has an awful lot to do with Chin’s witty, sonically imaginative and disquieting score. For this new production, staged for brief runs in both Los Angeles and London, Chin’s music is paired with the meticulous creativity of British director-designer Netia Jones to create a multimedia spectacle that transforms the sombre interior of the Barbican Hall into a riot of colour and sensation.A giant screen, poised diagonally on one corner as though dropped from a great height, fills the back of the stage, propped up by a luckless red-suited flunky, while the floors are patterned in zany monochromes. Even the orchestral musicians themselves (placed centre stage) aren’t exempt from Jones’s touch, each sporting a number on the back of their tail coats. One crawls determinedly around on the floor as the audience enters. Searching for something? You learn quickly not to ask why, just to surrender to whatever unfolds.We are flung down the rabbit-hole with one of the rare moments of really bass-anchored writing in the whole opera, an almost inaudible tremor that judders through the orchestra, shaking us out of the everyday and into Chin’s dreamworld. Jettisoning (mercifully) Carroll’s rather affected framing narrative, Chin supplies her own – a dream sequence in which Alice (Rachele Gilmore, pictured right) wanders through a black and white landscape peopled with Beckett-like characters. From here on out things get, well, curiouser and curiouser.Jones takes Ralph Steadman’s acid 1970s pen and ink illustrations of Alice as her touchstone, bringing many to life as animations, and taking others as inspiration for costumes (brilliantly fashioned by Jemima Penny) and characters. Colours are primary, designs are remixed, trippy versions of traditional styles, exaggerated and distorted for comic effect. The Queen of Hearts (the suitably stentorian Jane Henschel) sports a ruff wide enough to take out anyone in a two-metre radius, while the Duchess (Jenni Bank) bulges and balloons in a costume that makes a mockery of a woman’s curves. There’s little of the cosy storybook here; the Mad Hatter and his companions wear something that comes very close to a straitjacket, while croquet-mallet flamingos bleed copiously on contact with the hedgehog balls.It’s all a good fit for Unsuk Chin’s score, whose every bar announces her allegiance to Ligeti, her teacher. But while his strengths are her strengths – striking sonic soundscapes exploiting extremes of instrumental texture and register – his weaknesses are also hers. Such a narrative opera exposes the lack of dramatic momentum propelling Chin’s music. She establishes a beautiful and vivid sequence of musical scenes, whether the coloratura Sprechstimme of the Cheshire Cat (Marie Arnet), the fluting countertenor White Rabbit (Andrew Watts) or the virtuosic grumblings and shriekings of the Caterpillar, voiced by a solo bass clarinet, but then struggles to create arcs within or connections between them.Chin might get away with this if the work were trimmed back. After an initial burst of novelty and invention things do drag, especially in the courtroom scene, and could usefully have been tightened for this revival while the orchestration (reduced here, to fit the space) was being altered. There’s also a disproportionate emphasis on high, almost electronic sonorities. A combination of vocal glissandi, coloratura sopranos and upper strings and woodwind find those same denatured musical vibrations we recognise from Ligeti, deploying them a little mercilessly. Even the double basses pluck so hard their notes become brightly snapping textures, or strike their strings col legno for another brittle, tinkling sound.Though contending with some rather crude amplification which flattens all the voices out, the cast sell every bar. From the warm purity and agility of Gilmore’s delivery, to Bank’s maniacal, glittering Duchess and the wonderful boys of the Tiffin Choir, they give surreal without overworking it – a delicate balance, and one Jones herself also triumphs at. This trip down the musical rabbit-hole is not without its storm clouds, but its creative ingenuity and invention, visual and musical, still make the journey a vivid and an entertaining one. ALICE'S ADVENTURES ON STAGE AND SCREENAlice, Scottish Ballet.

348,"Ruddigore, Charles Court Opera, King's Head Theatre",Ruddigore,Charles Court Opera,2015-03-03,David Nice,"How can a feisty village dame duetting “lackaday”s with the mounted head of a long-lost, nay, long-dead love be so deuced affecting? Ascribe it partly to the carefully-applied sentiment of Gilbert and Sullivan, slipping in a very singular 11-o’clock number after so much Gothick spoofery, partly to two consummate and subtle singing actors, Amy J Payne and John Savournin, in a production of spare ingenuity by the latter, true Renaissance/Victorian man equally at home in opera and operetta.Savournin also makes a virtue out of the necessity of a nine-strong cast guided by a brilliant pianist – David Eaton, something of a Lisztian virtuoso when occasion demands – by giving us two Bad Baronets of Ruddigore for the price of one. Except, of course, that Sir Despard Murgatroyd, freed from having to commit one bad deed a day due to a witch's curse, turns extremely sober.That furnishes the other sublime sequence of the evening, a duet punctuated by “blameless dances” with the once-mad, also now reformed Margaret, calmed by the magic word ""Basingstoke"". Cassandra McCowan (pictured with Rebecca Moon's Rose Maybud on the left) is a revelation, alert to every word and vocal colour in the Lucia-ish Mad Scene of the first act and in the second consummate at suggesting excitability barely under restraint by the twitching of an eyelid. It’s part of the bliss of intimate theatre like this that everyone in the audience can see such signals.To single out these moments of high artistry, though, shouldn’t be to suggest that anyone else in a fine ensemble falls short of the mark. The performance as a whole treads a stylized but very fine line between the unfunny excess of overdone G&S – Scottish Opera’s Pirates of Penzance being an example, though there was also one singer in the Charles Court Mikado who overstepped the mark – and the wilt of a highly polished, more expensive production. That happened in Opera North’s much-praised Ruddigore: the first act sagged in the middle, as this one never did for a moment. Even the tricky portrayal of selfish sailor Dick Dauntless, sometimes a character too far in the setting-up of pastoral, seadog and Gothick satires, is energetically and just a little bit charmingly, if occasionally a bit too loudly, etched by tenor Philip Lee.Only one number had to go: you can’t do an ingenious double chorus with three out of this show’s four ladies. But Andrea Tweedale and Susanna Buckle, harmonizing with Payne’s Dame Hannah, play a far more integral role in the action than your average chorene. Completing the “distaff side”, as her quaint, etiquette-obsessed, Bible-spouting character might have put it, is Rebecca Moon as Rose Maybud, a charming evocation of keep-your-distance, come-hither confusion in a delicious double act with Matthew Kellett’s baronet-as-farmer, the apogee of false modesty (prize for topsy-turvydom in the always sparkling dialogue: “Ah, you’ve no idea what a poor opinion I have of myself, and how little I deserve it”). Kellett (pictured above with Simon Masterton-Smith as his ""valley-de-sham"" Old Adam) and Savournin both excel in the art of reluctant role-playing, neither of these Murgatroyds a natural moustache-twirler and Savournin’s Despard stuck in a rictus of disbelief at his assumed badness before turning into a humourless academic with a wry touch of the Stephen Frys.To reveal how a tiny company in a small space, albeit smartly designed by James Perkins and variously lit by Nicholas Holdridge, manages the scene in which the Murgatroyd ancestors – at least in the original libretto – come to life and step out of their picture frames would be to spoil half the fun. Suffice it to say that, like everything else in this clever, intelligent approach, the effect is simple, rigorously executed and laugh-until-you-cry funny. Maybe we miss Sullivan's crafty homage to Berlioz's more outlandish orchestration in ""The Ghosts' High Noon"", but Eaton more than compensates with what sounds like an improvised Liszt-style melodrama while abducted maiden Hannah assails her captor. Full marks, too, for nifty, likewise amusing choreography by Phillip Alden.So many people who’ve been to see the show, and persuaded me I had to go, have said, “I don’t normally like Gilbert and Sullivan, but this was just hilarious”; when done this well, the two old masters’ comic and lyric genius can only be vindicated again and again. Promising times ahead, too, with a long-overdue Princess Ida at the Finborough Theatre and Mike Leigh’s new production of The Pirates of Penzance at ENO. Don’t miss this firework, though.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/ruddigore-charles-court-opera-kings-head-theatre,5
349,"Le Roi de Lahore, Chelsea Opera Group, QEH",Le Roi de Lahore,Chelsea Opera Group,2015-03-02,David Nice,"Now that opera houses mostly lack either the will or the funds to stage the more fantastical/exotic pageants among 19th century operas – the Royal Opera production of Meyerbeer’s mostly third-rate Robert le Diable was an unhappy exception – it’s left to valiant concert-performance companies like Chelsea Opera Group to try and trail clouds of kitschy glory. Which, thanks to the usual astute casting of world-class voices for the solo roles and a remarkable semi-professional orchestra under Royal Opera chorus master Renato Balsadonna, they did last night.A confession first. While received wisdom declares that Werther and Manon are Massenet’s masterpieces, I’ve long been infatuated with the French parfumier’s magical epics. It all started with Joan Sutherland’s recording of Esclarmonde, the great prima donna taking on one of the most daunting roles in the repertoire (I even wrote to her as a teenager enthusing, and got a friendly letter back, complete with signed photo – now lost – of Joanie as Lucia - saying, ""I don’t think Covent Garden is very keen on doing the piece."" They eventually did, and I failed to get to see it).While Esclarmonde is a work of Massenet’s Wagner-infatuated maturity loosely based on the Chanson de Roland, Le Roi de Lahore of 1877, also recorded by Sutherland and inspired (again rather vaguely) by a story in the Mahabharata, is his first full-length opera, written without a commission. It starts with a plot line essentially resembling the love-triangle of The Pearl Fishers by Massenet's friend Bizet – temple-virgin soprano loved by tenor and baritone – but takes a different course; suffice it to say that the tenor hero dies in Act Two but carries on singing to the end of Act Five.The music takes some time to kindle, with only some experimental and much-repeated battle music and a pretty duet for soprano and mezzo rising to the top of the first act and a half, but the opera-by-numbers of the early stages is still quite something in the hands of a master, as Massenet already was at the age of 30 when he began work, and he eventually unleashes some fabulous and camp exoticism.Balsadonna and his forces hooked us from the first with the blend of belligerence and unmistakeably French lyricism. The COG strings now have real sheen in impassioned unison passages like the portrait of the protagonist as eternal sufferer. There was also the satisfaction, sometimes the amazement, of finding all the solo roles well cast, starting with Jihoon Kim’s loud, unmistakeably bass High Priest Timour. William Dazeley as wicked, lustful Lahore minister Scindia may have found the role a stretch for his essentially lyric baritone, but he went for it heart and soul, achieving beauties in his Act Four Arioso which would have been beyond coarser, more obviously Italianate baritones. For a second night running I missed veteran Robert Lloyd – indisposed both for the Royal Opera Magic Flute’s noble temple guardian and for promotion to Hindu god Indra – but we heard promising and, again, beautifully legato sounds from young Australian bass Joshua Bloom.The marvels, though, were to be found in the lovers' music. The Sitâ, hypnotically striking Armenian soprano Anush Hovhannisyan (pictured above) has already made a mark on the Royal Opera’s Jette Parker Young Artists Programme, where I heard her sounding wonderful as the Voice of the Falcon in Strauss’s Die Frau ohne Schatten, and the Sutherland role was a big challenge for her. She seemed to understand every word of the French, though, and while negotiating the huge demands with care, occasionally singing sharp – which is a better sign in my books than flat, showing excess rather than absence of commitment – hurled out some thrilling top notes. What's more, the voice has rare individuality; it will be exciting to hear it develop. The magic really began in her duet with servant Kaled, with steely-voiced mezzo Justina Gringyte, another Jette Parker singer,  scaling down to some ravishing quiet singing and true blend with the soprano.Which you couldn’t quite say for Sitâ’s lover, King Alim of Lahore. We know Michael Spyres’s huge stamina (the tenor pictured right by Dax Bedell) from his progressively more amazing Benvenuto Cellini at ENO, and perhaps if he’d sung a little quieter in the big love duet, he might not have been running out of a little steam – still thrillingly – in Alim’s big Act Four number, which would have been a showstopper if Massenet didn’t sweep the action onwards. Besides, this is an ardent tenor voice for French grand opera which I prefer to the good but perhaps over-touted Bryan Hymel, and he continued to pull all the stops out for the short but cataclysmic Act Five.The recording delivers knockout intensity here, a welter which I doubted the live performance could match, but it did, in spades. There’s so much great music in the second half, and it was a relief to hear the COG Orchestra getting to play the ballet music in Indra’s paradise with only a few snips – the parallel divertissement of Massenet's Cendrillon had been woefully cut in the group's 2008 performance – so that the audience could hear the strange sound of two saxophones in a swoony waltz. We even got a number cut by Bonynge on the Decca recording, the very odd titillation of mazurka rhythms in Hindu heaven. What a rewarding opera it is for the chorus, too: COG stalwarts could have done with a backbone of young opera students, given a work of this scope, but they coped valiantly for the most part.For all the passing glories, the number you come out singing is the Act Three duet, as gorgeous an inspiration as the mélodies eternelles of later Massenet. It’s as clear as Indra’s radiance that the next Massenet for the Chelseaites has to be Le Cid, with Spyres well equipped for the role recorded by Domingo. The real thrill of operatic hokum is to be found not at Covent Garden or ENO but with this ever more inspired and committed company.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/le-roi-de-lahore-chelsea-opera-group-qeh,4
350,"Die Zauberflöte, Royal Opera",Die Zauberflöte,Royal Opera,2015-03-01,David Nice,"Mozart’s The Magic Flute is one of those operas, like Verdi’s Il trovatore and all the mature Wagner masterpieces, which need a line-up of equally fine singers but rarely get it in the compromised world of the opera house. With Christiane Karg and Pavol Breslik as the trial-enduring lovers joining three performances in the latest revival of David McVicar’s production, and only Anna Siminska’s fifth-element Queen of the Night unknown to me, last night's team looked good in principle. And so it was in practice, if sometimes compromised by occasionally erratic staging, conducting and chorus work.Cornelius Meister led a game of two halves, less reliably so than Mozart in his mix of light and dark, with the Royal Opera Orchestra not always on top form. It may have been Meister’s insistence on little vibrato, period style, that robbed the strings of their warmth and vital singing quality. His first half rushed by, presumably adhering to the speedier spirit of Mozart’s age, but a top champion of authentic values like Sir Charles Mackerras would have given the singers more space to express their artistry at key points.That freedom only came in a looser second act, but it gave us two arias of pure perfection. Georg Zeppenfeld (pictured right in the centre), a peerless King Marke in Glyndebourne’s Tristan und Isolde, gave high priest Sarastro the perfect nobility of legato line and seamless range in his consolation of the beleaguered Pamina with “In diesen heil'gen Hallen”. And lyric soprano of the moment Christiane Karg caught all the light and the beauty of phrasing in the heroine’s aria of bewilderment at Tamino’s trial-inflicted silence in “Ach, ich fuhls”.You knew that this Pamina was a girl destined to become a powerful woman from the strength of her calls for Tamino on her Act One adventure, and her gleaming utterance of “Die Wahrheit” (""The truth"") when companion Papageno asks her what they should tell Sarastro. The scene of her attempted suicide pierced the heart, never mind a slip in the last few bars; let’s not forget the pitch-perfect projection of the Three Boys who stop her, last night Michael Clayton-Jolly, Matthew Price and Alessio Andrea, which was as good as it gets.As for the wondrous reunion with Tamino, it brought sublimity from both Karg and the apple of her eyes, handsome Pavol Breslik as a Tamino prone to convincing adolescent anger in the early stages of his development. They're a well matched pair, both with fast vibratos kept in check by superb musicianship. Unfortunately McVicar’s production didn’t help Karg (pictured above; no second-cast images available) with the feminist impetus she found in Pamina's journey: as Barbara Hendricks once told me, “she ends up leading him”, but in these feeble Trials of Fire and Water, she doesn’t (the movement group should also be told to stop gibbering and moaning over the flute solo; silent writhing would be more powerful). The opening-up of the sexist brotherhood to women thanks to Pamina's initiative isn't stressed clearly enough either, however promisingly set upNothing impeded the simpler journey of birdcatcher Papageno in search of a wifey. Markus Werba, wielding authentic Austrian dialect, instilled confidence from the start as a virile rather than a childlike natural man. He had what presumably were his own gags, including a premonition of Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy” on the panpipes, supplying the missing notes with his voice. He’s also a nifty dancer, and the second engagement of his magic bells brought a nice touch from McVicar, the two pompous priests sent to guide him (Harry Nicoll and Donald Maxwell) breaking into steps at the pretty tune.The duet with Papagena (Rhian Lois, bouncy, pictured with Werba right) brought the pure but rare delight of the wondering, then ecstatic ""Pa-Pa""s. Anna Siminska’s Queen of the Night had the flintiness for a mother’s theatrical plea, excellently supported by physical gesture, if a more careful approach to coloratura (though all bar absolutely perfect Fs in alt worked). Sinéad Mulhern produced too strident a top line for the necessary Mozartian sensuality as the first of the Queen's Three Ladies, though they convinced as a group, given good snake-like movements in this production.McVicar’s whole I’ve always find less convincing than many, despite some beautiful tableaux from genius John Macfarlane, sometimes at odds with old-fashioned follow spots on the singers and a space not quite filled by the performers. Some of us still want a bit more fantasy around the age of enlightenment and orreries. The cut-down dialogue was admirably delivered, though - three native German speakers among the leads certainly helped - and this is probably as strong a cast as the Royal Opera Magic Flute is going to get. That may well be true of the other team, led by Toby Spence and Janai Brugger, but this assembly is well worth catching in the next two performances.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/die-zauberfl%C3%B6te-royal-opera-0,3
351,"The Indian Queen, English National Opera",The Indian Queen,English National Opera,2015-02-27,Kimon Daltas,"When Purcell died at just 36, he left The Indian Queen unfinished, which only adds to the usual problems of staging his ""semi-operas"" – plays with musical interludes which don’t really accord with modern operatic tastes, despite the ravishing beauty of the music itself.Rather than tinkering around the edges, Peter Sellars – the director best known for his long-standing partnership with John Adams – has created a new piece entirely. Its narrated plot, borrowed from Nicaraguan novelist Rosario Aguilar's The Lost Chronicles of Terra Firma, is set around a particularly savage episode in the Spanish conquistadors' treatment of the natives, and is dressed with music from the original Indian Queen, plus significant additions of unrelated anthems and songs by Purcell, some with new texts, some not, the total clocking in at over three hours. So far, so good, except it just doesn’t work – at least not as a piece of theatre.It all starts oddly, with four dancers (pictured below) writhing silently to generic jungle sounds playing loudly from the speakers. This acoustic backdrop suddenly drops out, and the orchestra picks up a short instrumental air. Then the jungle noise cuts back in, then back to the orchestra, five alternations in total.Throughout, there is plenty of action on stage, especially from the four dancers who work their socks off, but it is rarely clear what relationship any of it has to the plot. The music, every note given exquisite attention by conductor Laurence Cummings and the orchestra, is too frequently undermined by the niggling question, “What’s this got to do with anything?”Much is signposted in the surtitles, but simply labelling something ""The Invasion of Human Dreams"" or ""Divine Mirror of the Lovers"" is not a dramatic device, it’s a cop-out. More puzzlingly still, ""The Apotheosis of Chief Tecum, the Massacre, and the River of Blood"" is followed by Hear my prayer, O Lord. It’s a heavy burden for this very familiar anthem, and it suffers further through the rather muscular instrument of the ENO chorus, which obscures the delicate strands of unfolding polyphony with misplaced operatic gusto.Indeed the chorus, normally a highlight of any ENO production, is subjected to various indignities, including acting out the polyphonic entries of Blow up the trumpet in Sion with trumpety gestures, looking like a community choir playing a warm-up game.There is, however, much to enjoy in the individual performances of a strong cast, including a pair of superb counter-tenors, Anthony Roth Costanzo and Vince Yi, whose contrasting timbres complement each other beautifully. The two tenors, Noah Stewart and Thomas Walker, are excellent though underused, while baritone Luthando Qave adds a rich anchor to the otherwise top-heavy palette. Julia Bullock as Teculihuatzin is the main focal point and handles it well, with a particularly memorable I attempt from Love’s sickness. Lucy Crowe (pictured above) as Doña Isabel has an obvious affinity for Purcell’s music and provides some of the most cherishable moments of the evening.The sets, a collection of backdrops and large canvasses by Chicano artist Gronk, are a riot of colour and energy, and really give this production a strong personality and visual appeal.When this Indian Queen rolled through Spain last year – it is coproduced by ENO with the Teatro Real and the Perm opera house – some booing and walkouts were attributed to its uncomfortable depiction of the conquistadors massacring the Aztecs. True as that may be, one can’t rule out the possibility that some people may have just been infuriated by the baffling nature of the production itself. That said, there were many in the ENO audience who clearly enjoyed it and heartily applauded the director as he joined the cast for curtain calls.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/indian-queen-english-national-opera,3
352,"Hansel and Gretel, Welsh National Opera",Hansel and Gretel,Welsh National Opera,2015-02-22,stephen Walsh,"After 16 years one might expect a revival of a repertory opera like Hansel and Gretel to come up with a dusty look and frayed edges. But Benjamin Davis has done a brilliant job pumping the life back into Richard Jones’s memorable but intricate 1998 staging of Humperdinck’s pocket Wagnerian masterpiece.For Jones, Hansel was less about fairies and witches, more about food; and in Davis’s revival they seem to be filling their faces, or imagining they are, even more of the time, from Hansel’s serial sampling of the cream at the start to the children’s serving up of the roasted witch at the end. Even their mother carries on nibbling while her husband details their likely fate in the witch’s oven.Images of eating abound, both in the staging and in John Macfarlane’s vaguely post-Sendak designs, dominated by drop curtains showing an empty (later blood-stained) plate and, most disturbingly, a vast snarling mouth like a vagina with teeth (main picture), out of which the gingerbread cottage emerges in the form of a large iced cake. If this suggests some attempt to equate the two strongest human instincts, the point is not laboured. The stage action itself is dominated by a sparkling display of irrepressible childish vitality against which grown-up fecklessness (and worse) is ultimately powerless. Whether or not the central pantomime in which the 14 angels reappear as tubby winged chefs laying a fish banquet quite matches Humperdinck’s vision of real angels descending a cloud-staircase, it’s unquestionably a more likely dream of starving children (pictured above right).Not that starvation is all that visible among the revival’s cast. This is a touchy subject, of course, perhaps best evaded by reading the well-fed looks as a deliberate oxymoron on the director’s part. Ailish Tynan  as a cuddly, enchanting Gretel in any case fits the text (in David Pountney’s witty English), which has Hansel (the svelt Jurgita Adamonyté) as the skinny one who the witch thinks needs fattening up. Either way, they make an irresistible pair, prancing and dancing and gesticulating entirely like 10-year-olds, and singing this endlessly inventive music like the angels the production otherwise lacks. At the end they join the chorus of rescued children in one of those rare operatic scenes that touch the simplest chords on one’s emotional keyboard, and that need, as Jones perceived, hardly any staging at all.Before this we this we have had the ghoulish pleasure of Adrian Thompson’s plump, leering witch-cook (pictured left with Adamonyté's stuffed Hansel), horribly sinister precisely because nearly real: no broomsticks or pointed hats in this highly mechanised kitchen. Humperdinck, it’s true, wrote the part for a mezzo-soprano and orchestrated accordingly, with a lot of middle register that sometimes works against the tenor voice. But then his scoring generally, schooled at Bayreuth and with much exquisite Wagnerian detailing, can be unkind to the voices.Miriam Murphy, as the children’s mother, rises best above the problem: what a shame she has so little to sing, virtually nothing after the first scene. Ashley Holland is her suitably blokish, drunken husband, who brings in the bacon just too late to feed his children. Meriel Andrew doubles as the Sandman (with one of the puppets that Jones later used so effectively in The Queen of Spades) and the Dew Fairy, wittily reimagined as the morning washer-up of, naturally, last night’s dinner.Lothar Koenigs pilots them all through a performance of great refinement and immaculate pacing. What a good conductor he is when in his element. And how well the orchestra play for him, whatever difficulties there may be behind the scenes. Nor was Toscanini always loved by his players. But how they played!",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/hansel-and-gretel-welsh-national-opera,5
353,"Farinelli and the King, Sam Wanamaker Playhouse",Farinelli and the King,Sam Wanamaker Playhouse,2015-02-21,alexandra Coghlan,"Farinelli and The King is pretty much a perfect piece of theatre. More importantly, though, it’s perfectly timed. In a month when English National Opera’s troubles have made the front page, when op-eds are all about why Simon Rattle’s dreams of a new concert hall for London are fruitless, this paean to music – to its serious, healing, transformative power – is not only resonant, but necessary.This is Claire van Kampen’s first play, but far from her first encounter with the Globe. A former Associate Artistic Director of the company, van Kampen (who also happens to be Mrs Mark Rylance) has composed music for over 35 productions in the theatre, including several at the new Sam Wanamaker Playhouse. Now she adds words to music – bringing one of the greats of baroque music to new and irreverent life.The story goes that King Philip V of Spain, suffering from severe mental and emotional instabilities, was introduced by his doctor to castrato-extraordinaire Farinelli – then the toast of Europe – as an early form of music therapy. So successful was the encounter, so calming the influence of Farinelli and his singing, that he remained at the Spanish court until the end of the king’s life and beyond.This is a historical drama, framed in the historical authenticity of the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, but there’s nothing prim or fusty about it. Van Kampen’s language is contemporary, sparking comedy in the friction between period setting and linguistic anachronisms; everyone says “fuck” a lot, and – in the best English tradition of obscenity – it’s very funny.It helps, of course, when you have Mark Rylance delivering your lines. It’s unclear whether Rylance is Philip V or Philip V is Rylance; either way it’s a performance that glories in a quick-witted script written with the actor’s distinctive cadence in mind. Discovered in the opening scene, silk-trimmed brocade nightcap askew, fishing in a goldfish bowl while stretched out on a chaise-longue, Rylance seems in danger of tipping over into self-parody. But just when we’ve settled down to a beautifully costumed romp, the script turns on its heel, taking us into darker and more disturbing territory, wit and whimsy barely concealing the king’s terror.The play pivots on Philip V’s relationship with Farinelli, the singer who swaps crowds for an audience of just one troubled man. The role is a dual one, making a virtue of the split-selves of any performer. Farinelli the man is played by actor Sam Crane (pictured above, behind Iestyn Davies) – awkward, timid, wise – while Farinelli the singer is British countertenor Iestyn Davies (William Purefoy in the later shows in the run), suddenly assured and completely captivating. In John Dove’s direction, the two shadow one other, taking it in turns to move into the foreground. It’s a visual sleight-of-hand that’s much more than a musical convenience.Only Queen Isabella (Melody Grove, pictured left) seems at odds in van Kampen’s handling, too often reduced to playing the straight (wo)man to Rylance’s historical sitcom, denied much by way of inner life until almost the end. Even then it’s only as the central party in the inevitable love-triangle. It’s a small quibble in so accomplished and attractive a piece of theatre, however.Though the music itself (arias by Porpora, Hasse and Handel) can and does make its case alone in Davies’ performances, it is aided by Jonathan Fensom’s gorgeous designs and by the interiors of the Wanamaker itself – its gilded panelling and candle-lit loveliness the perfect foil to this glittering miniature of a show. Robert Howarth and his team of period musicians make the space ring, but when Farinelli delivers his final aria – “Lascia ch’io pianga”, a poignant cry for freedom and release – it completes the illusion, finally discovering that sustained stillness we’ve been searching for throughout the evening.At core Farinelli and the King  is a play about the clamour of contemporary life, and the search for peace amongst it. It’s a tender and timely reminder that music keeps us sane in a world with too much noise and not enough songMARK RYLANCE’S BIGGEST HITS ON STAGE AND SCREENBridge of Spies.

354,"La Vida Breve/Gianni Schicchi, Opera North",La Vida Breve/Gianni Schicchi,Opera North,2015-02-19,graham Rickson,"The good news first: director Christopher Alden’s new production of Gianni Schicchi is quite brilliant, and one of the funniest, cleverest things you’ll see in an opera house. Puccini’s taut one-acter is difficult to mess up, but it takes some skill to present it this well. Alden’s version is full of pleasures. Like Rhys Gannon’s stroppy young Gheradino, who spends most of the action wearing headphones and playing on an iPad. Choreographer Tim Claydon’s mute, acrobatic Buoso Donati leaves this earth with some reluctance, his ghost continuing to haunt the stage. Victoria Sharp’s blingy Nella looks like Donatella Versace. These relatives are a nasty, greedy lot. While this is a contemporary updating, many of the details suggest that Alden has a deep respect for Fawlty Towers. Particularly an episode where the absent Sybil has to be impersonated by Connie Booth’s Polly.You expect the trickster Schicchi to be portrayed as an elderly, beaky chancer. Instead we get Christopher Purves’s cocksure, strutting con artist (pictured right). He’s a magnificent creation; a lovable, sharply-dressed bruiser whose keen mind and big heart are instantly apparent. The fake deathbed sequence is brilliantly handled, but Purves is at his best in an earlier scene, capitulating to the demands made by daughter Jennifer France and prospective son-in- law Jesús Álvarez. France's showstopping “O mio babbino caro” is gorgeous, and her beau is an appealingly bookish, geeky presence. The delights come thick and fast: the closing, gratuitous snow flurry is a lovely touch, and Schicchi’s closing words are sweetly delivered. Fantastic, in other words. Alden’s ensemble cast act physically as if possessed, and Doey Lüthi’s neat costume designs convince. Puccini’s capricious, bubbling score is nicely conducted under Jac van Steen. It all works like a charm.This is a double bill, and the first half, a revival of Alden’s 2004 production of Falla’s La vida breve, is nowhere near as successful. As a piece of stagecraft, it’s astonishing, and a treat for the eyes. However, the more audacious directorial decisions don’t serve this rarely performed opera well. What we see is always visually arresting, brilliantly choreographed and exquisitely sung. We’re not in a village foundry but a corrugated iron sweatshop, where the men loaf about and the women are hunched over sewing machines. It’s an unpleasant, sweaty environment, but one so cramped and crowded that it’s difficult to get any sense of who’s who. Voices emerge unexpectedly, and it can take sharp eyes to detect who is singing. Daniel Norman sounds glorious but looks ludicrous as a transvestite seamstress, and even more incongruous is Quirjin de Lang’s crimplene-clad flamenco singer (pictured below).What we see ends up as more black comedy than tragedy. Anne Sophie Duprels sings beautifully as Salud, but her blood-drenched demise fails to convince. Falla’s sublime score is this production’s chief pleasure, with some wonderful writing for tuned percussion. The obbligato guitar is a delight. Opera North’s chorus excel. All is paced to perfection by Steen, and the big fortissimo explosion 30 minutes into the piece is startling. Elizabeth Sikora’s Grandmother almost steals the piece. Alden’s fussy reimagining makes this La vida breve an infuriating, confusing experience. But his Gianni Schicchi is so perfect that I’m inclined to forgive him.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-vida-brevegianni-schicchi-opera-north,4
355,"The Mastersingers of Nuremberg, English National Opera",The Mastersingers of Nuremberg,English National Opera,2015-02-08,David Nice,"After seven glorious Welsh National Opera performances in the summer of 2010, it looked like curtains for Richard Jones’s Mastersingers (or Meistersinger, as it then was, sung in German): no DVD, no co-productions. The director seemed happy with that, as philosophical as Wagner's operatic characterisation of 16th-century cobbler-mastersinger Hans Sachs. Such, he implied, was the ephemeral nature of the true theatrical experience, rare at a time when nearly everything gets documented. Now that a syndicate of passionate Wagnerians has helped to bring it back against all odds, even those who love to say, “You should have seen Bryn Terfel's Sachs”, will, I hope, be running round like me declaring, ”But you’d be mad to miss it this time.”The heart leaped almost as much to see once more Paul Steinberg’s dropcloth collage of 103 game-changing German artists from Bach to Bausch (pictured below as reproduced on WNO's original postcard) as it did to be enveloped in the warmest C major ever, that of Wagner’s tradition-conscious Prelude (the faces glow brightest in Mimi Jordan Sherin’s lighting when the celebrated triple counterpoint after the climax genially unfolds). Edward Gardner took no time at all to strike the authentic warmth from the ENO Orchestra, sustained with voice-friendly elegance for the conversational passages and the perfect mix of slower tempi with tender introspection for the great monologues and little love scenes. His ENO Rosenkavalier might have led one to expect as much, but this was even finer than anticipated.Everything in the production moves with similar ease and charm. Act One, laying down the rules of civic musicians which are there to be bent or broken, is all ordered society with odd folk stepping or moving out of line (and Jones loves knocking his straight lines out of kilter). First, there’s goldsmith’s daughter Eva magnetised by knightly outsider Walther as he moves slowly past the congregation in which she’s singing a Lutheran chorale. Later, when her father Veit Pogner – James Cresswell, as noble a merchant as you’re likely to hear – welcomes the company of Mastersingers, Iain Paterson’s Sachs arrives late and scant of breath, and never quite becomes one of the group – renaissance finery unbuttoned, cap not only undoffed but unworn. Jones is a master of body angles to set the naysayers or the questioners apart: there’s a beautiful symmetry in the midsummer day song contest of the last scene when Malvolian competitor for Eva’s hand, town clerk Beckmesser (Andrew Shore), mangles the prize-song text and Sachs alone faces forward, bleakly unamused by the latest predictable act of headlong folly.Though Jones makes it easy for his Sachs to be simpaticissimo, we soon realise that Paterson is not going to play second fiddle to the memory of Terfel or Norman Bailey before him. What he lacks in bass-baritone gravitas at the bottom end of the register he makes up for in spades in his shining, secure top, the intelligent, lyrical phrasing and vocal colour which make so much of Sachs’s Act Two musings under the scented elder – ENO horns especially exquisite here – and the anger behind his cobbler’s song to try and exorcise his feelings about the flirty girl who’s much too young for a rough widower.Though the production is mostly clean and clear, Jones introduces a characteristic quirk when Walter hallucinates a procession of box-headed markers, chalks held aloft, on the attack in a dream-replay of the day’s earlier defeat at the song school; it’s a lovely tableau when Eva cradles his collapse. As in the WNO original, the crowd riot provoked by Beckmesser’s insistent serenade is kept to a minimum so the chorus can keep time with Gardner; all the more violent action is in David’s thwacking of the singer he thinks is wooing his girl (pictured above). The image before curtain-fall I don’t remember from before: the town clerk backing off, starkers, with only his mandolin to cover his privates: a funny-sorry sight, as if wound up by his music to succeed, and unable to stop mouthing the words in near-insanity. Shore, a master of understated tragicomedy, plays it just right.If these are scenes in Act Two you won’t forget, the ones in Wagner’s massive but never otiose last act surpass them. Three stretches are absolutely the best I’ve ever heard them played and expressed. In this, the English translation undeniably helps with the direct sense (though it feels rather antiquated in its slavish attempt to follow Wagner’s Sachsian rhymes and would fill the marker’s slate with errors of stress). The first of the big moments is the easily lilting dialogue in which Sachs gets his pupil to interpret his dream and the Prize Song melodies come to light, Walter lying on the daybed in Sachs’s jumbled widower’s room (top marks again to Steinberg) as the cobbler plays proto-Freud to write it all down. It's a situation which now has a parallel moment in Jones's Glyndebourne Rosenkavalier to keep it company – and there the Herr Professor Doktor actually appears.The second highlight is the most beautifully sung Quintet to hit the stage, at least in my experience. The lustre of mezzo Madeleine Shaw’s Magdalene, not to be overshadowed by her mistress Eva, at first outshines Rachel Nicholls’s rather less focused Wagnerian soprano. Nicholls (pictured left with Paterson's Sachs in Act Two) doesn’t quite pull off the main reason for having a heavier voice as the ingénue, the apostrophe to “Sachs, my friend”, which makes her lead in the Quintet, and the way everyone keeps it down to make this the highest point of time suspended, all the more miraculous. There’s even a righting of a faulty stage picture on WNO's opening night: the bright idea we missed then turns out to be a magnesium flare on the single page of manuscript paper, symbol of true art, pegged high above the wondering five.For the third coup, the ENO Chorus pulls out all the stops in its eulogy to Sachs, not to be outdone by the Welsh voices which helped to make the original last scene such an Eisteddfod, and Paterson’s great man responds with tones of infinite tenderness, bringing the personal back into the public arena. We’re reminded that the depression which nearly made him bolt at the beginning of the act is never far away.The tenors come close in the right order to the evening’s hero. Gwyn Hughes Jones (pictured right with Paterson's Sachs in Act Three) is vocally a rather feminine Walther if you’re looking for Wagnerian beef but he has no problems at all through the range, stays the course like Paterson - sheer stamina can't ever be a given in Wagner - and delivers the Prize Song each time as the great beauty it is. Nicky Spence’s apprentice David ran into a couple of problems with the higher phrases in Act One last night, but his set-up of the Masters’ rules – often a sticking point – bowls along charmingly with deft visual illustrations of the types of song and the guide to good delivery, wheeled around on cabinets by the energetic apprentices.Ultimately, though, it’s the collective celebration of great art in chapter and verse which matters as the company, decked out in Buki Shiff's cod-Renaissance finery, one by one turn out placards of the pioneering 103, capped by Paterson in a playful line-up of principals at the front holding up the one we didn’t get on the dropcloth – Hans Sachs (1494-1576) himself. I defy you not to want to roar with joy at the end, and never mind Sachs's last-minute ambiguous defence of a Germany under fire which Jones just about papers over (shame Wagner felt obliged to tack that on, but there’s no need to flag up the Nazis; it's still all about the power of art). For all ENO’s peripheral troubles, this great ensemble show – one of many over the past year – should make anyone who cares about the art of opera production ashamed to wish any kind of plague upon this noble house.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/mastersingers-nuremberg-english-national-opera,5
356,"Der fliegende Holländer, Royal Opera",Der fliegende Holländer,Royal Opera,2015-02-06,alexandra Coghlan,"Like the Dutchman himself, Tim Albery’s Der fliegende Holländer makes its inevitable return to the Royal Opera House. Unlike the Dutchman, however, this production has broken free of its cycle of repetition. Perhaps expectations have changed, perhaps after two outings I’ve just surrendered to Tim Albery’s severe and sober staging, but for the first time since its 2009 debut this ghostly ship finally comes in to emotional harbour.This unexpected sea-change has everything to do with Canadian soprano Adrianne Pieczonka – a blisteringly beautiful Senta, who pairs a disarming purity and sweetness of tone with tremendous vocal power. There’s a ferocity, an intention to her delivery that makes sense of Albery’s rather oblique production. Here is a woman possessed by an unnatural obsession, a woman set apart from the grey world around her by the blazing belief in her destiny. The candle she carries throughout her ballad mirrors the searchlight that strafes the audience throughout the overture, a beacon leading her to her only possible fate.Where Anja Kampe has previously showed her vocal working in this role, Pieczonka gives little sign of strain, discovering new power and heft for a final scene that chills with its conviction. This Senta might not throw herself into the water at the end, but for the first time that doesn’t seem to matter. As she drops to the floor, clutching the miniature ship to her belly, we know that this curse, this death, is one of the mind, just as her passions were too.Bryn Terfel (pictured right with Peter Rose as Daland), the production’s original Dutchman, returns here – wiser, possibly, and certainly more bitter. If there’s less vocal loveliness here than once there was that’s no bad thing, with the character crystallising into something altogether crueller and more inscrutable. The odd crack on opening night only added to an unselfconscious performance that eschews any kind of show for a psychological seriousness. “Die frist ist um” feels more contained, the arc of emotion starting smaller but more potent, aided by David Finn’s claustrophobic lighting.Michael König leads the best supporting cast yet for this production, crooning out his pleas to Pieczonka’s Senta with dangerously persuasive delicacy. With two voices blending power and beauty so equally,“Bleib, Senta! Bleib nur einen Augenblick!” was transformed, matching the orchestra’s strings for blend. Also impressive is Ed Lyon. Currently reprising his Amidas over at the Globe in L’Ormindo, the tenor is living something of a double musical life at the Royal Opera this month. If Tuesday night’s Cavalli showed his musicality and way with an ornament, last night’s Steersman was all about power and projection. This is a voice that just keeps growing, and though it lacks John Tessier’s legato in this role, it finds a ringing brilliance that is all its own.Andris Nelsons conducts a performance that is both gentler and more sensitive than his recent recording with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. Wind and brass had their scruffy moments (as did the chorus, though also moments of glory), but the overall momentum was steady and controlled – a match for Albery’s unfussy visuals.Far from weather-beaten, this Dutchman is improving with age and acquaintance. A clean visual concept and stellar singing remind us of what this house does best – a merciful contrast to the 2014’s last adventure on the high seas. There’s not a shark in sight, but Der fliegende Holländer still has more menace in its watery pools than Idomeneo in its ocean.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/der-fliegende-holl%C3%A4nder-royal-opera-0,4
357,"Leiferkus, LPO, Jurowski, RFH",Leiferkus,LPO,2015-01-22,Matthew Wright,"To pair Rachmaninov’s brooding and little-performed The Miserly Knight with Wagner's brooding but much-performed Das Rheingold is an audacious piece of programming. The operas share an interest in the mortal power of money, and Rachmaninov’s score has a more distinctly Wagnerian colour than much of his later work. To do so in a single evening, requiring substantial cuts to the score of Rheingold, and to stage them in the Royal Festival Hall, shows boldness verging on the reckless.Both the programme, and the editing of Das Rheingold, were the work of Vladimir Jurowski: the first, a brilliant concept, necessitating the less convincing second. It’s unlikely that The Miserly Knight – performed by the same team of Jurowski, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, Sergei Leiferkus (as the eponymous Baron), and director Annabel Arden, to modest reviews at Glyndebourne in 2004 – could have drawn an audience without the attraction of a proven favourite like Rheingold. Such are the tantalising compromises of orchestral programming.The sound Jurowski coaxed from the orchestra, especially in the liltingly fluid depiction of the Rhine’s movement, was exquisite. The layers of orchestration remained translucent and fresh, the ensemble sharp and the dynamic sense bright and vigorous throughout. The excision of large parts of the central action, however, was clumsy. It would perhaps have been preferable simply to play the Prelude and Scene One, followed, after a short interval, by the Entry of the Gods into Valhalla. The seams were obvious.Rachmaninov's negligible plotting and characterisation are absolved once the characters are no longer seen as human beingsThe dramatic deficiencies of The Miserly Knight were widely aired during its Glyndebourne production 11 years ago. A bitter story of a psychotically grasping and acquisitive father and his hapless, indebted son, Pushkin’s original ""little tragedy"" which forms the one-act opera's libretto was never intended for performance. Its bleak, desperate vision of characters trapped inside their own narrow circumstances nonetheless evades a real sense of tragedy by dint of the sheer, irredeemable unpleasantness of everyone on stage, among whom, for extra distastefulness, is an ugly stereotype of a moneylending Jew. Though last night’s programme was intended to highlight the genuine affinities between this score’s pulsing, brassy characterisation and that of Wagner, there's also an intriguing sense of Rachmaninov anticipatingthe symbolism of Bartók’s Duke Bluebeard’s Castle. Pushkin’s and Rachmaninov's negligible plotting and characterisation are absolved once the characters are no longer seen as human beings, but as projected values and types, whose role is in a quasi-philosophical debate rather than a realistic drama.What the piece lacks in conventional draman, it more than makes up in a superabundant orchestral character, which Jurowski once again unveiled in rainbow vividness. Individual characters were matched astutely with instrumental colour, the Moneylender, for example, isung here by Peter Broder, is accompanied by viola and lower wind, reflecting his wheedling vocal line. The long central act in which the Baron revels in the power of money (satirical inversion of the traditional operatic declaration of love? Statement of existential despair?) was superbly rendered as a kind of autumnal storm of sharp edges and foreboding.  The RFH inevitably leaves a certain amount to be desired as a dramatic operatic space. Visually, Rheingold was the more successful, with the Rhinemaidens elevated evocatively above the watery music from the orchestra. The Miserly Knight was more fully staged, with the action spread widely through the hall. Yet such a huge space is unsuited to a small-scale psychological drama, and the characters wandering through the stalls tended to emphasise how much too large this space is for a work which is both intimate and only partially naturalistic.Judging by reports from around the hall, the acoustic consequences of having solo singers where a choir was intended to sing were unpredictable. From the front of the stalls, Vsevolod Grivnov’s Albert, the Baron’s son in The Miserly Knight, was completely overwhelmed by the orchestra when singing in the choir stalls above the stage, but was reported to be in excellent voice by those sitting higher up. There were moments later in which his fine dramatic tenor came through more clearly to everyone, but it’s a voice that depends on a more balanced and specifically operatic space.Not everyone suffered singing from a space physically above the orchestra, however. All three Rhinemaidens projected vividly, with Harriet Williams as Flosshilde in particularly luscious and buttery mezzo voice, while Albert Shagidullin sounded suitably noble as the Duke, ticking off the parsimonious Baron from on high. Vocal performance of the evening, however, undoubtedly came from Sergei Leiferkus (pictured above). He had seemed a little underwhelming as Alberich (was he holding back?), but his Baron spat and rasped with vicious delight as he revelled in the delusional power of his riches. It’s perhaps no coincidence, however, that his long scene two solo took place from the back of the orchestral stage, and benefited from its acoustic shape. If Jurowski’s ambition slightly exceeded the facilities at his disposal, it was with two performances that were orchestrally sumptuous.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/leiferkus-lpo-jurowski-rfh,4
358,"Andrea Chénier, Royal Opera",Andrea Chénier,Royal Opera,2015-01-21,alexandra Coghlan,"What kind of regime, asks Gérard, talks of justice while killing poets? It’s a question the answer to which suggests itself all too swiftly this week, briefly turning a revolutionary romp of an opera into something rather more chilling. Playing things straight in his new production of Andrea Chénier (if wigs and lavender stockings, chandeliers and pastoral divertissements can be called straight), David McVicar may have missed a trick with a story that speaks with surprising clarity about the violence of political and ideological conflict. Or maybe he didn’t. This period production is the gilded and polished frame that showcases the Royal Opera doing what they do at their absolute best.It’s hard to get past the spectacle of it all – elegant Ancien Régime interiors, lit so beautifully with early-evening warmth by Adam Silverman, giving way to cinematic street scenes. Yes, these revolutionaries are improbably shiny and recently washed, but this is Hollywood-does-history, Les Mis - The Opera, and it looks all the better for it.It helps that the visuals are so entirely in sympathy not only with Illica’s libretto, but also with Antonio Pappano’s approach in the pit. In his hands a good score almost passes for a great one, sweeping doubts away in massive, enveloping string gestures and a final apotheosis of brass that crowns even the ecstatic final duet between Maddalena and Chénier. The Royal Opera House Orchestra has rarely sounded better. They support an enormous cast of over 20 named principals (is there a bigger one in the repertoire?), a generously bolstered chorus, and a troupe of actors and dancers.The combined forces all come together to tell a story that Dr Alexandra Wilson’s programme essay invites us to see not necessarily as penury-and-prostitutes verismo, but perhaps as more of a romance, with more than a hint of Grand Opera. It’s an approach that privileges interiority over social commentary, one that might falter with weaker leads. But Jonas Kaufmann and Eva-Maria Westbroek (pictured right) once again lift all around them with the tenderness and conviction of two exceptional performances, calibrating an emotional arc that climaxes with unexpected ferocity in the Act IV finale.Kaufmann plays a long game, underplaying “Un dì all'azzuro spazio”, allowing its stand-alone beauty to dissolve into the narrative flow. Leaning slightly more into “Credi al destino”, he still holds back, exercising tremendous control in order to release all in the courtroom confrontation of “Sì fui soldato”. This outburst must surprise the character as much as his onlookers if it is to succeed, to find an anger not available to him in the salon of the start. Westbroek is a worthy partner, and if her voice speaks too much of wisdom to completely convince as the Act I ingénue, she more than makes up for this in the pathos and warmth of Acts III and IV.It’s a star-squandering cast – blink and you’ll miss Peter Coleman-Wright and Peter Hoare – but it’s a particular bonus seeing Rosalind Plowright (the Royal Opera’s Maddalena at their last Chénier staging, 30 years ago) return as the Contessa di Coigny, a brittle performance setting us up for a disquieting rethink at “La mamma morta”. Željko Lučić’s Gérard took a while to settle on opening night, but “Nemico della Patria” finally flowered, this one opportunity to humanise a two-dimensional character seized with affecting intensity.So much of the character of the production comes from context, whether the sets or the chorus, actors and minor character roles. Adrian Clarke’s Mathieu compresses a life-story into his few moments in Act III, a cameo that sets the tone for a courtroom filled with lively, chattering humanity rather than a block-choreographed collective. It’s a shame the foreground action is so utterly absorbing that you miss more of their tiny details than you catch.If denial and abstinence are the watchwords of your January, then this new Chénier may not be for you. There’s spectacle and excess here in bucketloads, matching Giordano’s score gesture for gesture. But there’s also music-making of unadorned quality, simple excellence that stands on its own merits. This Andrea Chénier is a great show, whether you close your eyes or keep them open. You can’t say fairer than that.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/andrea-ch%C3%A9nier-royal-opera,4
359,"Orfeo, Royal Opera, Roundhouse",Orfeo,Royal Opera,2015-01-14,David Nice,"It’s quite a distance from the first performance of Monteverdi’s operatic cornucopia under the Mantuan Gonzagas’ imperious eye to this democratic celebration at the Roundhouse – 408 years, to be precise. Michael Boyd’s production takes us back even further, to those ancient Greek festivals of poetry and music which inspired the intellectual Florentines to fashion the art of opera in the late 16th century.One third of the Roundhouse seating is blocked by a grand edifice with a contemporary court seated half way up, the orchestra at its base, leaving us in a near-perfect amphitheatre with the performers on a semicircular stage and a ramp that leads upwards to liberation, or downwards to hell. Take off the roof, and we could be in a smaller-scale 21st century version of Athens’ Theatre of Dionysus.It all not only looks austerely beautiful in the spare designs of Tom Piper – he of the Tower’s simple poppy-river of blood – with powerful lighting by Jean Kalman, but it sounds amazing too. I’m not sure I would have known, had the press officer not been sure to tell some of us before we went in, that discreet amplification had been used, for whatever Sound Intermedia had done merely enhanced the gorgeousness of Monteverdi’s 21-piece orchestra and left the voices to engage at close quarters. Our proximity made one wonder afresh at the glory of the operatic voice: it was a highlight to have Gyula Orendt’s Orfeo or Susan Bickley’s Silvia acting so intensely with their voices on the ramp only feet away.Boyd, who has already worked the Roundhouse space less successfully in the RSC Antony and Cleopatra, made me wonder what he was up to at first here, too.  His context is to have the myth of the great musician who loses his new bride and goes down to Hades to reclaim her, only to lose her again by looking back as he leads her towards the light (pictured above), told by a group of prisoners in an authoritarian court, a contemporary Mantua. With East London dancers and acrobats of diverse ages enlivening the scene, we should be smiling at the wedding of Orpheus and Euridice. But we feel constrained by the enforced storytelling; there's no real joy, so her death doesn’t quite come as the extreme contrast it should.Once we’re in hell, though, it all begins to fit. The terribly handsome, strikingly coutured ducal couple who’ve been watching the action as we watch them, spellbound, become Pluto and Proserpina – equivalent to Midsummer Night’s Dream equation of Theseus and Hippolyta with Oberon and Titania. They sound as gorgeous as they look (pictured left), the utterly compelling Rachel Kelly especially, though Callum Thorpe’s is a voice of promise, too, a bass to match the authoritative Charon/Security Guard of James Platt (like Kelly, a singer on the Royal Opera’s Jette Parker Young Artists Scheme). Principals melt into the chorus of students from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, especially superb and immediate in the lament that follows Euridice’s death. There are expressive cameos from Bickley, tenor Alexander Sprague and countertenor Christopher Lowrey, but their contributions are rightly only part of a musically near-perfect whole.How we miss Christian Curnyn, founder-conductor of the superb Early Opera Company; I wish him a full return to health with all my heart. But Christopher Moulds, from the harpsichord and sometimes the organ, certainly directs the EOC ensemble with verve and soul. In this space, whatever the role of the “enhancement”, every timbre can tell, from a sole note on the lirone/cello as grief strikes to the solemn harmonies of the brass Monteverdi was able to call into play at the Mantuan court.  It was an inspired decision, I think, to have Alessandro Striggio’s text sung in a never too self-consciously poetic translation by Don Paterson. True, the speech-melodies of the original Italian are lost, but a new, near-perfect fit takes their place – and as the Roundhouse audience was a genuine mix, with plenty of young people in the cheaper seats with no restricted sightlines, that helped. At first I questioned the English text's delivery by Transylvanian baritone Orendt (as musician, above), and I’ll always prefer a honeyed British ex-choral-scholar tenor of the kind we now have in droves singing the great test of Orfeo’s power to move by music, best known in Italian as “Possente spirto” with its wonderful interjections from cornets and harp (Siobhán Armstrong, consummate). But Orendt richly atones with true vocal and dramatic intensity, his Euridice, Mary Bevan, not too far behind him.Orendt’s great moment comes not in the centrepiece but in his final plea when he’s lost his other half again and is a plaything of the gods (for which, in this production, read the Catholic Church). Infinitely simple and confidential, playing on the discreet but extraordinary dissonances with the now scaled-down group of instruments, this was the true core of the evening, and Boyd caps it by bringing back the suspended halters in which Euridice has already been laid and carrying his Orfeo aloft, Orendt managing to act for his life as he stretches downwards to his reviving love. An unforgettable tableau in a visual context which will linger in the mind’s eye, as the sounds will in the ear, for a very long time.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/orfeo-royal-opera-roundhouse,4
360,Best of 2014: Opera,Best of 2014: Opera,,2014-12-27,David Nice,"When everything works – conducting, singing, production, costumes, sets, lighting, choreography where relevant – then there’s nothing like the art of opera. But how often does that happen? In my experience, very seldom, but not this year. It's been of such a vintage that I couldn’t possibly choose the best out of six fully-staged productions – three of them from our only native director of genius, Richard Jones, who as one of his favourite singers, Susan Bullock, put it to me, deserves every gong going – and one concert performance.Fortunately I didn’t need to lean too hard on my distinguished colleagues to help me out in two cases. Jessica Duchen felt the same as I did about the ENO staging of John Adams's bewilderingly rich and fluent The Gospel According to the Other Mary, and Stephen Walsh covers my most immediate operatic experience of the year, Graham Vick's promenade Khovanskygate in Birmingham. Indeed, that was one of the most exceptional performances of anything I've ever witnessed. If opera has a future, and is to draw in new audiences, Vick's approach is one way of securing it.While there’s no substitute for the total work of art, the Gesamtkunstwerk as Wagner defines it, opera in concert-hall semi-staging or less can do most of the work and leave the rest to your imagination (Alexandra Coghlan expands on that point below). Our five choices in this sphere need no special pleading, and out of them comes what was for many of us the performance of the year, Nina Stemme’s astounding Salome (pictured above by Chris Christodoulou). Before it – and having caught only the first two of the four operas in last year's Proms Ring, where her Götterdämmerung Brünnhilde was a revelation to so many – I’d admired rather than been bowled over by the Swedish soprano. Her note-perfect, rock-solid and dramatically convincing Royal Opera Isolde at the end of the year goes to winning her a double gold medal.The revival of Christof Loy’s thoughtful and beautifully lit production, its sightlines much improved, and the arrival of Robert Carsen's justly famous staging of Poulenc's Dialogues des Carmélites – one of several other choices which could have made the shortlist – saved the Royal Opera from having slapped on it the label of unsuccessful Regietheater, director’s opera, which shouldn’t be a dirty word and in cases like these two certainly isn’t in my book. Yet RO Director of Opera Kasper Holten, having kicked off his reign last year with a Eugene Onegin which I seem to have been among the few to love – it looks even better on DVD – started 2014 with yet another ill-defined Don Giovanni. Holten slips into the short list, all the same, through the Royal Opera's trip across the river to the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse with Cavalli's L'Ormindo.Back at Covent Garden, there was a clichéd Idomeneo from Martin Kušej stuck in the 1970s and the year ended miserably with Katharina Thoma’s inert Un ballo in maschera (here’s another director who, unlike Kušej, I wouldn’t write off – again I was in a minority who admired her Glyndebourne Ariadne auf Naxos). Jonathan Kent’s awkward, oversized concept didn’t quite dwarf dream lovers Jonas Kaufmann and Kristine Opolais in an otherwise marvellous Puccini Manon Lescaut (a choice by Jessica Duchen which didn’t quite make the top 10 list). A similar lumpiness also did a fine cast no favours in Glyndebourne's only disappointing new production, of Mozart's La finta giardiniera; this jury is still out on the promise of young director Frederic Wake-Walker.Apart from Loy’s Tristan and Carsen's Carmelites, the other salvation of the Royal Opera season was Claus Guth's lucid but also atmospheric dream-solution to Strauss’s monumental Die Frau ohne Schatten, strongly cast (Elena Pankratova, Michaela Schuster and Emily Magee pictured above) and with a transparent account of the fiendish score by Semyon Bychkov. That was as daring, repertoire-wise, as any British house got in Strauss anniversary year; to see any of the rarities you had to travel abroad. I was delighted to notch up Strauss’s second opera, the one-act romantic comedy Feuersnot, in Dresden; it was a chance missed not to present that fast-moving masterpiece at the Proms. It would certainly have made a more balanced companion to the Salome than Elektra, too much the following night, and musically not on the same level. It also didn't help that I was still reeling from Patrice Chéreau’s production, his last, filmed at Aix, my DVD of the decade on the BelAir label with Evelyn Herlitzius lacerating as the vengeful heroine and every role down to the usually insignificant servants contributing to a great ensemble.It’s always swings and roundabouts for London’s two major houses, and while the Royal Opera had a disappointing year, English National Opera picked itself up from a run of turkeys last autumn to triumph in 2014. David Benedict raved about the revival of Britten’s Peter Grimes. Other highlights which followed included Christopher Alden’s handsome Victorian Rigoletto, two spot-on tours de force from Richard Jones (see below), musical high standards in Julian Anderson’s way too telegraphic Greek tragedy compendium Thebans, Terry Gilliam's curate’s-egg, chuck-everything-at-it attempt at Berlioz’s most testosterone-driven score Benvenuto Cellini – which Jessica loved unreservedly, though I thought the tricky second half worked better than the overloaded first – and Mozart’s The Marriage of Figaro in a revival of Fiona Shaw’s production excelling the original: another highlight for Alexandra, barred from the top 10 only by virtue of being a revival.ENO made little fanfare about producing two top women conductors in a row – Canadian Keri-Lynn Wilson handling Puccini well and Portuguese Joana Carneiro blazing in Adams: signs that the times are slowly changing. Meanwhile the flow of outstanding young singers makes it difficult to choose the best, though Paula Murrihy, pictured above with Michael Spyres, excelled in Cellini and at least three were to be found in the Snape Owen Wingrave, a showcase for innocence and experience. Am I worried about the future of opera? Not per se, not in this country, but ENO has to do something about its ticket pricing if it wants to get over the half-empty houses seen all too often even for well-reviewed shows. And no premiere this year stood out, least of all in the Linbury Theatre, but given the ratio of survivors to what Prokofiev called ""one-day butterflies"" that only means we should keep on trying all the harder to find the repertoire of the future.After whittling, I still couldn’t pare off one from the Top 10 list, so there are 11, listed in order of performance through the year. Contributors are Alexandra Coghlan, Kimon Daltas, Jessica Duchen, Christopher Lambton, Graham Rickson, Stephen Walsh and me. Rodelinda, ENO How to choose between three tirelessly inventive productions from the only visionary of the British stage, Richard Jones? I could have gone for his astounding reinvention of Hofmannsthal’s stage directions for Strauss’s Der Rosenkavalier at Glyndebourne, where the second and third acts passed quicker than they’ve ever done before in my experience – thanks also to Robin Ticciati’s unobtrusive pacing – or The Girl of the Golden West at ENO, surprisingly faithful to the gold-rush scenario of Puccini’s most musically elaborate opera. That I’ve plumped for one outside my comfort zone, Handel’s Rodelinda, is simply because the vocal ensemble, led by the greatest countertenor of the present Iestyn Davies and that most stylish of sopranos Rebecca Evans (pictured above by Clive Barda with superb young actor Matt Casey as son Flavio), came closer to vocal perfection than in the other two operas. As always, Jones evokes elements from previous productions – portrait photographs, squalid small rooms, his own focused brand of mania – while moving on to something new and,  in the splitting apart of the “house” at the end of Act Two, spellbinding. DNL’Ormindo, Sam Wanamaker Playhouse It should probably count as cheating. This Royal Opera production of Cavalli's L’Ormindo on its own terms wasn’t astonishing – though competent and certainly amusing, it perhaps overspent energy in the search for laughs leaving other facets of the work less realised. But its use of the new Sam Wanamaker Playhouse at the Globe was so clever, and the replica Jacobean indoor theatre itself so charming in candlelight, that it became one of the most memorable London operatic experiences of recent years. Good old rope-and-pulley stagecraft has plenty of life left it in yet (pictured above, the ensemble by Stephen Cummiskey). A brilliant translation, splendid costumes and a delightful young cast also helped, of course. It was successful enough that they’re bringing it back for 12 performances from 3 February 2015 – but don’t rush to book. It’s already sold out. KD Khovanskygate, Freedom Tent, BirminghamThe memorable surprise of the year was certainly Graham Vick’s production of Musorgsky’s Khovanshchina, updated and retitled Khovanskygate, by Birmingham Opera in Edgbaston’s well-named Freedom Tent. The performance had to overcome my instinctive loathing of walk-about opera, but did so by literally surrounding us with the work in all its chaos and confusion, just as if we had really crashed in on a riot (pictured above, Joseph Guyton and Eric Greene as Khovansky father and son, photo by Donald Cooper). It helped, of course, that the performance was musically the best I’ve heard of this difficult piece, not least in making sure that the more modish aspects of the production never interfered with the music’s audibility. It’s been a good year in general for Russian opera. Gergiev’s semi-staged Betrothal in a Monastery in Cardiff’s Millennium Centre was a revelation, a witty, vivacious, deeply sensitive account of this neglected masterpiece. What a shame that neither of these performances is ever likely to be repeated. SWOwen Wingrave, Aldeburgh and Edinburgh FestivalsI never thought it would work for me, but Britten’s opera for television based on Henry James’s plea for pacifism moved me to tears and made my hair stand on end as staged at Snape Maltings. Neil Bartlett worked wonders with Stravinsky’s The Rake’s Progress on a shoestring at Aldeburgh some years back, and here with minimal sets he used one simple conceit: the ghosts of tradition besieging anti-military Owen become the military bullies of the future. The triumph was consolidated with deep-delving conductor Mark Wigglesworth. Like the Glyndebourne Traviata (see below), this was a venture where you felt that the singers were closely tied to every sound and gesture from the orchestra. The extra dimension was the mix of vintage British singers including Susan Bullock, Janis Kelly and Jonathan Summers, with outstanding newcomers. If Ross Ramgobin (pictured above as Owen by Robert Workman) and Catherine Backhouse don’t make it big, there’s as little justice in the world as there is in Britten’s and James’s hermetically sealed Paramore. DNGötterdämmerung, Leeds Town HallThe world’s media descended upon Leeds Town Hall in July, when the city hosted the Tour de France’s Grand Depart. Equally impressive was a hot Saturday afternoon and evening in early June, when Opera North’s Götterdämmerung concluded the company’s Ring Cycle. Long in gestation, this was jokily referred to as an austerity Ring, dependent on second-hand Wagner tubas. In retrospect, the budgetary constraints proved to be one of the cycle’s greatest assets. Peter Mumford’s elegant video and lighting effects neatly sidestepped Wagner’s extravagant stage demands, making the drama disarmingly accessible. The casting was strong, with Alwyn Mellor’s Brünnhilde (pictured above with Farnes and the Opera North Orchestra) and Mati Turri’s bluff, likeable Siegfried both excellent. The biggest cheers rightly went to Opera North’s modest, unfussy Music Director Richard Farnes, whose conducting of each instalment stunned those of us lucky enough to be in attendance. An augmented Orchestra of Opera North played as if possessed; the players’ exhausted smiles saying so much. I blubbed, along with most of the audience. Farnes will conduct the whole cycle in 2016 – as a stopgap the company will perform a semi-staged Flying Dutchman next summer. GRLa traviata, GlyndebourneLike Bartlett's and Wigglesworth’s Owen Wingrave, if on a bigger budget, Tom Cairns's new Glyndebourne Traviata fielded a fine example of singers fusing with director, conductor and orchestra to provide a perfect unity. Sir Mark Elder is known for his detailed work on every front, and this was a masterclass in how both performers and players can realize the essence of Verdian phrasing. A star is definitely born, rather belatedly after his American triumphs, on the British stage in the shape of tenor Michael Fabiano, due back at Glyndebourne next season in rare Donizetti; the compelling and beautiful Violetta of Venera Gimedieva (pictured with Fabiano by Richard Hubert Smith) was not overshadowed by his Alfredo, and it was good to hear a real Verdi baritone, Tassis Christoyannis, back on the Glyndebourne stage. Cairns's  production made its points unobtrusively, but always with painterly beauty from Hildegard Bechtler's designs and Peter Mumford's lighting: a reminder that no production makes it to the top without these vital components making an essential contribution. DNSalome, Royal Albert Hall The Deutsche Oper Berlin under Donald Runnicles’s musical guidance must be one of the best ensembles in the world, with one of the most transparent, silvery orchestras around and every bit part perfectly cast, if this demi-staged performance at the Proms was anything to go by. Runnicles followed up last year’s spectacular Proms Tannhäuser with an effortlessly perceptive view of Strauss’s spider-web, only swamping the voices when the occasion demanded it. While Samuel Youn’s John the Baptist briefly came a cropper forcing the sound in the big space – no need – the audience was bowled over by Doris Soffel’s imperious Herodias, but above all by Nina Stemme’s Salome, an amazing interpretation which caught the teenage capriciousness of the early scenes before pulling all the stops out – as I’ve never quite heard her do before – for the ""Transfiguration through Love"" of the last 20 minutes as Salome addresses the prophet’s severed head, arousing excitement, pity and disgust all at the same time (Stemme taking a bow with Runnicles pictured above by Chris Christodoulou). DN Alcina, Barbican HallIt’s come as a surprise to me to discover that both my top opera picks for 2014 are concert performances rather than fully-staged productions. Opera-in-concert gets bad press, and when it is dull it is very dull indeed. Done right, however, it can be transcendent – the purest and most essential dramatic reading of a score. And it was so when Joyce DiDonato joined forces with the English Concert to bring a super-starry performance of Handel’s great(est) opera to the Barbican. Alice Coote (pictured with DiDonato by Mark Allan) and Christine Rice joined DiDonato for the mightiest quota of mezzo-sopranos seen anywhere this year, and the result was vivid, humorous and moving. Plus there was That Dress by Vivienne Westwood. AC Wozzeck, City Halls, GlasgowThis very-slightly-staged concert performance of Berg's Wozzeck demonstrated that even on a damp Thursday night in Glasgow it is possible to present opera to the highest international standards in Scotland.This was a wonderfully rich evening demonstrating that neither Scottish Opera nor the Edinburgh Festival have a monopoly on unique operatic events north of the border. Credit must go to the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra and its principal conductor Donald Runnicles to have the imagination and determination to pull in an impressive cast (for one night only) that included huge performances by Thomas J Mayer in the title role (pictured by Alex Woodward) and Elena Zhidkova as Marie. Mayer was, in fact, a late substitution, but I was told by Runnicles’ wife that “Donald was thrilled to get him”. I had a chance to confirm Mayer’s stature a few weeks later when I happened to hear him in Zurich's Opera House as a compelling Barak in Strauss's Die Frau ohne Schatten. CL Pelléas et Mélisande , Royal Festival HallSuperlatives are dangerous things, but I have no fear in applying them here. This concert performance of Debussy’s opera by the Philharmonia Orchestra and Esa-Pekka Salonen was one of those rare instances of musical alchemy. A late change of personnel, a light-handed semi-staging by David Edwards and a reading full of generosity and insight from Salonen came together to generate something extraordinary. At the core of it all were Sandrine Piau and Stéphane Degout (pictured) as the eponymous innocents – performances so complete as to be unimprovable. Only a recording from this cast and these orchestral forces could crown what was a singular achievement: for me, the best night of music all year.  AC The first full staging of John Adams's “passion oratorio” (pictured left by Richard Hubert Smith) – premiered in concert in the US and heard once before here at the Barbican – did not please all, but those of us who loved it did love it very much. In spiritual impact it was astounding – even as an atheist I still run to Bach and Wagner’s Parsifal for that same rush. Then there was the richness of its colouring, full of weird and fantastical percussion, plus electronic elements such as frogs at dawn; the strength and compassion of its settings – the fine poetry of past and present helps; and the absolute conviction of its performers, led by mezzo-soprano Patricia Bardon as Mary and, as Martha, Meredith Arwady, a true knock-'em-dead contralto. In the pit the young Portuguese conductor Joana Carneiro drew everything together and made it leap to coherent and vibrant life. Designer George Tsypin and lighting designer James F Ingalls matched the soundworld with magically shifting visual colour. Special plaudits for flex dancer Banks, a Lazarus and Angel Gabriel with much muscle.

361,"Un Ballo in Maschera, Royal Opera",Un Ballo in Maschera,Royal Opera,2014-12-19,David Nice,"Covent Garden’s masked balls circling around the New Year feature not the seasonal bourgeois Viennese couple and a bat-winged conspirator but a king, his best friend’s wife and – excessively so in this production – the grim reaper. Big voices are what’s needed if it’s Verdi rather than Johann Strauss II, and if we can’t have Jonas Kaufmann, who’s committed his energies to a lesser protagonist, Giordano’s Andrea Chénier, this coming January, then much-trumpeted Maltese tenor Joseph Calleja will have to do. Sadly conductor Daniel Oren is no substitute for Antonio Pappano, also Chénier-bound, and the production is a dud.That's surprising from young German director Katharina Thoma, whose convalescent-ward jolt in Strauss’s Ariadne auf Naxos at Glyndebourne I was among the few to admire. Thoma nominally updates Verdi’s 17th century Boston or 18th century Stockholm to Mitteleuropa on the eve of the First World War, but Soutra Gilmour’s stage designs are drab, the few new ideas ineptly executed and the overall feel as conventional as any of Elijah Moshinsky’s mannequin-parade Royal Opera Verdi productions from the 1980s and 1990s. Much is made of what Elisabetta in Verdi's Don Carlo calls ""the peace of the tomb"": as it's Sarajevo assassination time, everyone is half in love with easeful death, and graveyard statuary comes to life as a zombie movement group. The moments in which the main tomb is wheeled onstage as platform for the principal characters are clumsy, especially so when the conspirators lift Amelia on it while husband Riccardo is shoved symbolically - but at odds with the realistic context - into an open grave.It also transpires – and this Thoma's Glyndebourne Ariadne couldn’t have told us – that she doesn’t know how to handle large groups, leaving choreographer Lucy Burge to do some unusually staid infilling, and nor does Oren: this is the messiest contribution I’ve heard from the Royal Opera Chorus, conspicuously so in the first and last scenes yesterday night, and it looked as if unclear direction from the pit was to blame.Perhaps Calleja can’t be directed. His movements are stiff and generic, while his distinctive tone – vibrant to some, bleaty-sounding to me – gets in the way of the Verdian line. He also ought to have a bit more fun with the irresponsible ruler in the carefree mode of the opera’s early stages. But then Serena Gamberoni’s stock, charmless page boy Oscar doesn’t either; the Parisian Opéra-Comique touch is dully handled by Oren and there’s no panache onstage, with military manoevres going on during what should be a sparkling Act One Scene One galop-finale. Dmitri Hvorostovsky (pictured above) as friend and minister Renato has to push sharp-ish at times, but this cello among great voices produces some beautiful legato singing, peerlessly so in the calmer section of the big aria “Eri tu, and sets up high expectations with the typically long phrases of his first cavatina.Energy goes up a notch after the first 20 minutes with the arrival of witch Ulrica, true Verdi mezzo Marianne Cornetti as a fashionable séance-mistress delivering baleful prophecies as usual (pictured left with women of the Royal Opera Chorus). I can’t hear her as Brünnhilde, a role the programme tells us she’s tackling, but on the other hand I also can’t wait for Liudmyla Monastyrska to travel north of the Alps from her Verdi calling-cards and essay Wagner’s Ring. More dramatic than lyric, her Amelia is a size too big, but better that than too small or top-less.Monastyrska is also a superb musician and technician, singing stylish pianissimos and dominating ensembles like no other Verdi soprano I’ve heard (that was evident right from the start in her Covent Garden debut as Aida). Given the right director, she can act too, but here she simply looks noble or stricken, dignified against the graveyard monuments come to life in the midnight scene and giving the good mother bit – for Amelia's son is onstage a great deal – her best shot.It’s Oren’s fault as much as Thoma’s if the interest comes and goes. Given such strong voices, the set pieces back in Amelia’s and Renato’s home can’t go wrong – and I’d recommend you go and see this production for these alone - but all life bleeds away long before the assassination. Verdi’s stunning mixture of experiment and tradition deserves a lot better than this.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/un-ballo-maschera-royal-opera,3
362,"The Way Back Home, ENO, Young Vic",The Way Back Home,ENO,2014-12-12,alexandra Coghlan,"A Martian, a Spitfire and a flatulent penguin are the unlikely ingredients for The Way Back Home, English National Opera’s first foray into the colourful world of children’s opera. And if those don’t sound like enticement enough, be reassured, at only 45 minutes long this really is a child-friendly taster of a genre that doesn’t always get the best press when it comes to accessibility.Amahl and the Night Visitors, L'enfant et les sortilèges, Hansel and Gretel, Where the Wild Things Are: opera for children might be a niche-of-a-niche, but over the centuries it has punched above its weight. Perhaps that’s owing to the challenges it poses, forcing composers to strip opera right back to its essence if they wants to grab (and hold onto) a new and increasingly impatient audience. Here the task falls to composer Joanna Lee and librettist Rory Mullarkey, who respond with warmth, invention and refreshingly few musical concessions.The best children’s operas all have one thing in common: a really good source story. Lee picks a winner here with Oliver Jeffers’ contemporary classic of a picture-book The Way Back Home, adapted and extended here to fill out a (short) evening’s entertainment. A boy (Victoria Simmonds) and his penguin (Peter Hobday) discover a Spitfire in their living room and decide to take it out for a spin. Once airborne, the boy runs out of petrol and crash-lands on the moon, where he encounters a Martian (Aoife O’Sullivan) with engine-trouble. After a few narrative turns and loop-the-loops, both end up safely home, with a little hindrance from the scheming Gizmos, whose plane the boy has unwittingly stolen.Any child familiar with the original will love how closely Vicki Mortimer’s designs mirror those of the book. Colours are primary, but the shades are rich and dark rather than predictably neon-gaudy, and props that are determinedly two-dimensional add a reassuring Lo-fi, analogue charm to proceedings. Director Katie Mitchell makes no attempt to be cool or current, which conversely makes the show feel that much fresher.Lee’s score is all 21st-century, however. Pitching her music somewhere between a conventional operatic score and a sequence of sound effects, she gets away with some fairly bold harmonic language. It’s the musical equivalent of concealing vegetables in a child’s dinner, and with the aid of zooming aeroplanes, oozing aliens and groaning monsters, it all slips down painlessly, and with a pleasantly onomatopoeic crunch.Michell’s young cast gamely throw themselves into the pantomime drama, while delivering melodic lines that are not without some fairly significant challenges. O’Sullivan’s Martian is a stand-out, glorying in her mechanistic sing-song phrases. Simmonds (pictured above) – part Christopher Robin, part annoying Not Now Bernard – is energetic and engaging. Both, however, are outshone by the glorious shuffling rotundness of Hobday’s Penguin (pictured left). I suspect all children will prefer this anarchic, pugilistic, flatulent creature to the ever so slightly ghastly child, and the ending wisely celebrates this with an unexpected little coda.The show is apparently aimed at 5-8 year-olds, but I question whether the creators didn’t miss a trick in not catering more generously to the upper end of this range. The capital’s young sophisticates can handle a lot, and sweetly engaging though the show is I wonder whether a bright seven or eight-year-old wouldn’t feel just a little short-changed by the drama.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/way-back-home-eno-young-vic,4
363,"Karajan's Magic and Myth, BBC Four",Karajan's Magic and Myth,BBC Four,2014-12-06,Adam Sweeting,"There have been legendary conductors, and then there was Herbert von Karajan. He was a colossus of post-World War Two classical music, equipped with fearsome technical mastery allied to a vaguely supernatural gift for extracting exquisite sounds from orchestras. But that wasn't all. An expert skier with a passion for high-performance cars and flying his own jet, he was as charismatic as a movie star or sporting idol.John Bridcut's superb profile surveyed the Salzburg-born Karajan as if he were Mont Blanc or the Matterhorn, considering the contradictions in his character as though studying aspects of the landscape at different times of day amid changing weather conditions. Monomaniacal and power-crazed, or a generous collaborator with esteemed colleagues? A self-obsessed narcissist, or a dashing man of the future with a vision of how new technology could transform the public's understanding of music? An artistic genius, or a gifted actor playing the part of one?There could be no single answer, but the fact that Karajan, who died 25 years ago, remained an impenetrable enigma was a powerful ingredient of his allure. Enraptured by his own mythology, Karajan protected his privacy obsessively. This film interviewed a long roll-call of his collaborators and professional partners, but none claimed to have known Karajan well. If the conductor had close friends, nobody knew who they might have been (Karajan with his third wife Eliette Mouret, pictured above).Karajan's early professional success in Germany coincided with the rise of Nazism, and the fact that he joined the Nazi party in 1933 has been used as  a stick to beat him with. The evidence suggests he did this for personal self-advancement rather than from ideological zealotry, and his second wife Anita, who he married in 1942, was considered one-quarter Jewish under the regime's arcane rating system. But perhaps this sliver of darkness lent a dash of Mephistopheles to the Karajan myth.Much of the enjoyment of Bridcut's film, apart from the footage of Karajan conducting Strauss's Don Juan or Mahler 5 or Jessye Norman singing Wagner's Liebestod, came from the fascinating range of characters he'd rounded up for interviews. Veterans of the Philharmonia Orchestra from the 1950s remembered the impact of the slender, charismatic conductor (""he was sort of sexy somehow,"" said violinist Kathleen Sturdy). Sir Mark Elder analysed clips of Karajan in rehearsal, as he tweaked microscopic nuances of tone. Conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt, formerly a cellist in the Vienna Philharmonic (pictured above), recounted a chilling tale of how Karajan made a faltering violinist stand up during rehearsals and play his part solo, then ordered him out and had him dismissed. Violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter, nurtured by Karajan as a teenage prodigy, praised his supportiveness as a conductor, then recalled how his daredevil attitude to flying made her, and everyone who flew with him, sick.At his peak, Karajan's recordings accounted for 10 per cent of the global classical market, and for many listeners, ""classical music"" meant the discs he recorded  on Deutsche Grammophon with the Berlin Philharmonic. But in his later years his behaviour grew more egocentric. He shamelessly milked encores for personal gratification, and embarked on a campaign of videotaped orchestral recordings with his company Telemondial, designed to showcase the God-like attributes of the Maestro. Former Berlin Philharmonic flautist James Galway (pictured above) had some fabulous anecdotes about how Karajan would force bald musicians to wear wigs for the filming, and then not show their faces anyway. Karajan disliked Galway's dishevelled beard, so while listeners heard Galway on the soundtrack, he was replaced on camera by the clean-shaven flautist Andreas Blau. Karajan made sure the audience couldn't misbehave by using life-sized photographs instead of people.It was hardly surprising that the Berlin Phil eventually fell out of love with their increasingly dictatorial supremo, though their rejection seemingly hurt Karajan deeply. He found succour with the Vienna Phil, and Placido Domingo remembered a performance they gave of Bruckner's 8th symphony in New York, not long before Karajan's death. He recalled ""a religious feeling, adoration, and at the same time kind of nostalgic, like an end of an era."" As indeed it was. There were ""not many in this world like him,"" commented the conductor's devoted personal assistant Lore Salzburger.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/karajans-magic-and-myth-bbc-four,5
364,"Pelléas et Mélisande, Philharmonia, Salonen, RFH",Pelléas et Mélisande,Philharmonia,2014-11-28,alexandra Coghlan,"In an operatic world in which the director is an increasingly despotic king, it’s good to be reminded that, sometimes, not staging an opera is the most radical reading of all. No elaborate set or concept dominated David Edwards’s one-off Pelléas et Mélisande at the Royal Festival Hall last night. There were just suggestions, allusions, echoes. And a cast – what a cast – that came close to perfection.Or course Pelléas isn’t just any old opera. Debussy’s “unusual” music-drama breaks all the rules, unfolding in a sequence of dramatic fragments, the orchestra offering the guiding string through their emotional maze. The result demands to be handled with care: grasp it too roughly and – like its heroine – the opera’s meaning shrinks ever further away.Edwards’s semi-staging understood this, deploying gesture with care. Boldest of all was the addition of spoken narration – texts taken from Maeterlinck’s own writing and elegantly arranged by Gerard McBurney. Part synopsis, part literary and philosophical commentary, in Sarah Kestelman’s charged delivery it added a mythic, folkloric quality to proceedings that found a visual echo in Edwards’s direction. A pedestal stood modestly at one side of the stage, occupied by a different object – crown, sword, bird –  for each of the five acts. A talisman? A theme? A portent? All these and more.And then there was the movement. Freed from the restrictions of scores, the cast moved extensively, but rather than collide Debussy’s stylised interactions and Maeterlinck’s symbolist action with naturalistic gestures, Edwards kept his figures at a distance. A single encounter – Pelléas (Stéphane Degout, pictured right) grasping Mélisande’s hair, for example – would take place dually and separately, each figure enacting their portion on opposite sides of the stage. Rather than alienating though, the effect was curiously natural, emerging out of (and responding to) the curious coolness, the emotion-recalled-in-tranquility of Debussy’s score.Conducting the Philharmonia Orchestra for this, the opening concert in their City of Light season of Paris-themed events, Esa-Pekka Salonen played a long game. Just as the opera’s action unfolds at a distance, so the music remains curiously muted, veiled, until at least Act III Scene III and the emergence from the castle vaults. Delaying release until this point, Salonen let sudden light flood the stage – a musical coup de theatre so natural, and so hard to achieve. The interludes too were showcases for a minutely blended orchestral sound bordered by metallic harps at one end and the woody massed strings at the other.Standing in for an ailing Monica Bacelli, Sandrine Piau’s Mélisande (pictured left) was as troubling as it was poised. Piau’s nymph-like delicacy suits no role so well as this traumatised princess, and here it set off a vocal performance in which every utterance was drama first and music second. Denied the opportunity to dazzle with her fine-spun legato in extended phrases (save the opening of the tower scene in Act III scene I – exquisitely sung), she instead found beauty and psychological interest in disjuncture, in the stichomythic exchanges that divide a single melody into conversational fragments.She was aided by a Pelléas of rare quality in Stéphane Degout. A baritone whose voices peels away its darker outer layers to reveal an upper register of properly tenorial sweetness, Degout finds a natural path through Debussy’s challenging writing, making sense vocally of a man who lives in the liminal spaces – not brother, not stranger, not husband, not lover. He had plenty to chafe up against in Laurent Naouri’s Golaud, who moved from surprising opening gentleness to closing horror in terrifyingly gradual evolution. Right up until the murder of Pelléas it could all still have gone another way – a cruel potential that other overtly darker productions have lacked.Felicity Palmer gave her best performance in ages as Geneviève, with Chloe Briot was an urgent and brightly sung Yniold. Only Jerome Varnier didn’t quite connect as Arkel – too youthful, for one, but also vocally a little too detached, lacking the character needed at the lower end of the voice to really ground his scenes musically.It’s a small quibble though. This was a Pelléas of rare conviction, a performance to make sense of a score whose problems and challenges feature far larger in discussion than its virtues. I’d now call loudly for more stagings, but that would rather defeat the point. Besides, I’d like to live with the memory of this non-staging for a while longer first.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/pell%C3%A9as-et-m%C3%A9lisande-philharmonia-salonen-rfh,5
365,"The Gospel According to the Other Mary, English National Opera",The Gospel According to the Other Mary,English National Opera,2014-11-22,David Nice,"A great creative partnership like the one between composer John Adams and director Peter Sellars can endure the occasional wobble. In his peerless autobiography Hallelujah Junction Adams is frank about the information overload in Sellars’ premiere production of the millennial opera-oratorio woven around the birth of Christ, El Niño. His semi-staging of its companion piece The Gospel According to the Other Mary seen at the Barbican last year was, on the other hand, so pure, focused and perfect within Sellars’ usual semaphoring bounds, that I feared the full works might unleash excess again. Not a bit of it: what we see is as lucid, mature, soul-piercing and still in its intensity when it needs to be as what we hear, a score which finds Adams moving on yet again in remarkable ways.The temptation might have been to furnish an accompanying film again, this time of the lives of Mary – Magdalene and, when it suits the retelling of the myth, yet another Mary – and Martha, who run a women’s refuge and march with migrant workers in between participating in the Passion. Here, though, the “eternal present” is shared exclusively between six singers and four dancers as well as chorus; you quickly grasp that none of them is playing just one role. The physical and vocal fluidity is as haunting as the set by George Tsypin. Another artist who sometimes favours excess, Tsypin gives us only a space wide open despite metal fences and security cameras, crowned by a billowing tent and backed by a series of screens on which are projected, ever so discreetly, limbs and torsos. The lighting by Sellars regular James F Ingalls is perhaps the biggest miracle of all other than the music, including a representation of rosy-fingered dawn in the burial garden which is one of the most beautiful tableaux I’ve ever seen on a stage.It also moves with the music’s fluctuation between oppressive, jabbing, rhythmically unstable violence and time frozen or dissolved in hypnotic or billowing sound canvasses. Under Joana Carneiro the ENO Orchestra has never sounded better. And - it shouldn’t need mentioning, but it’s still a rare enough occurrence - here’s the second fine woman conductor at English National Opera in a new production following on from the equal triumph of The Girl of the Golden West. It thrusts or whispers home Adams’s now-consummate art of orchestration fine-tuned to suit every situation, whether in growling low brass, gentle string rain or the many woodwind solos amplifying the singers’ statements, piercingly high oboe the most unforgettable.While I still lament the absence of Alice Goodman, supreme poet of Nixon in China and The Death of Klinghoffer, Sellars’ composite libretto works more often than not; some of the contemporary poetry sticks in the throat, but repetition often, oddly, enhances it. You can hear most of the words from a uniformly fine team of soloists (no high female or low male voices). Patricia Bardon (pictured above with dancer Stephanie Berge) is now the still but intense and compassionate centre, a mezzo verging on contralto good enough to stand comparison with Adams’ and Sellars’ late lamented muse Lorraine Hunt Lieberson; her companion is the even more extraordinary pure contralto Meredith Arwady. Heroic tenor anguish and energy pour, as in the Barbican concert performance, from Russell Thomas, and the countertenor trio which veers between joint Evangelical and other roles is once again the inseparable team of Daniel Bubeck, Brian Cummings and Nathan Medley.If the excellent ENO Chorus, getting their meatiest role since Peter Grimes, might not be quite as multi-racial as Sellars would like, the compensation comes in the dance quartet. The absolute revelation of the evening, apart from Ingalls’ lighting and the score if it’s new to you, comes from the phenomenal flex dancer Banks (what, no programme biography? I'd go to any one-man show this man might put on). He represents Lazarus’s wonder at his new life, which in my confusion with the staging of Colm Toibin’s The Testament of Mary and my scepticism at the miracle aspect of the New Testament I had hoped would yield to its impossibility and his second death, with tortured, visceral brilliance, proof that Adams writes the best, most startling dance music of any living composer. Later, in the earthquake before Christ’s reappearance in the garden, he flies (pictured above). But he can also be as quiet and careful in minimal movements as the other principals.Musically, it’s an evening of pervasive, nearly unbearable tension. In the parallels between the first act’s raising of Lazarus and the second’s Crucifixion plus aftermath, Adams and Sellars let us off the hook to bring tears to our eyes towards the end of each half. In the first, it comes with the tenor’s magical incantation “this year in fear and shame, next year in strength and justice”, harmonies around it becoming consonant if only briefly. In the second, time stands still from the garden burial vigil through to a truly incandescent, visionary conclusion. “The chill of grace lies heavy on the morning grass”, as Chou En-Lai sings at the end of Nixon in China. The audience afterbuzz was palpable last night. Now it’s time for Sellars to complete an ENO triptych and revisit El Niño in his wisdom: next Christmas, insh’allah, in strength and justice.Next page: an introduction to The Gospel According to the Other MarySellars, Adams and others introduce The Gospel According to the Other Mary ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/gospel-according-other-mary-english-national-opera,5
366,"L'Elisir d'Amore, Royal Opera",L'Elisir d'Amore,Royal Opera,2014-11-19,Jessica Duchen,"“Watch out for the dog!” instructs Covent Garden’s programme for its latest revival of L’elisir d’amore. These creatures do have a way of stealing shows, but the canine who dashed across the flat Italian cornfield after Dr Dulcamara’s decrepit lorry had some impressive competition – from Vittorio Grigolo’s behind.The Italian tenor de nos jours, as Nemorino letting his hair down under the influence in part two, was apparently proving himself a hotter mover than the audience had anticipated. Fortunately his singing more than matches his dance-floor expertise; by the time the opera reached ""Una furtiva lagrima"" the crowd was eating out of his hand and this most gentle and innocent of tenor arias truly stopped the show. Grigolo’s voice, fully unleashed, is a magnificent, pure-tenor animal; but its magnetism can also carry us all with him into the heart of every quiet note. It might be difficult to believe in such a starry chap as the sweetly awkward Nemorino, but with singing like that, it scarcely matters.Laurent Pelly’s production, dominated by giant haystacks and Dulcamara’s convertible lorry, has become a perennial favourite at Covent Garden. Throw in plenty of sunshine, bumbling motor-scooters and black-shirted soldiers, plus a strong dose of Pelly’s trademark stylisation, and Donizetti’s irresistible score cannot help but work its magic on a murky November evening.Our Adina was the English soprano Lucy Crowe, making her role debut. Vocally she sailed through it, her vivid tone bright, accurate and apparently effortless; dramatically perhaps she needs to settle in a little more, letting even this slightly two-dimensional production offer her more depth of character. Pelly’s moments of excess cutesiness looked a bit uncomfortable, but those are more his responsibility than hers. Levente Molnár had even fewer dimensions to work with, in terms of character, as Belcore (pictured above left with Crowe), but gave his all nonetheless; and there was a lively solo slot for Kiandra Howarth, a Jette Parker Young Artist, as Gianetta.The star turn for which the audience was waiting was that of Bryn Terfel, no less, as the quack Dulcamara (pictured below with Crowe), whose magic potion promises solutions to all ills, including unrequited love. The front curtain of 1950s-style Italian adverts for the substance are enormous fun – possibly more than Terfel’s “Doctor”, who emerged as gruff and offhand at first, his voice’s Wagnerian size compressing less than ideally into Donizetti’s delicacy. The second half found him warming up, allowing himself a twinkle in the eye as Adina pinged his braces; in the end his charisma wins through, as irresistible as the opera itself.In the pit, Daniele Rustioni – an alumnus of the ROH’s Jette Parker Young Artist Programme (and music director of the troubled Teatro Petruzzelli in Bari) – led a sassy, upfront performance, occasionally a tiny bit driven, but in the main with tempi nicely judged and balance with the singers equally so. Bel canto is best when it sounds as if it simply plays itself – an illusion, naturally, but a good one – and Rustioni’s proved heart-warming.Ultimately, though, the night was Grigolo’s, despite the best efforts of all around him to rise to the challenge his presence posed. He came on last of the cast for the curtain-calls, milking the applause; one could scarcely blame him, given the reception he received, but this pattern of bowing is becoming a top-tenor trademark in some places and it is difficult not to wonder whether today’s fine sopranos, tackling equally demanding roles, might not feel a tad miffed. Still, the general consensus seemed to be that the sun shone out of his backside.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/lelisir-damore-royal-opera-0,4
367,"Daphnis et Églé/La Naissance d'Osiris, Les Arts Florissants, Christie, Barbican",Daphnis et Églé/La Naissance d'Osiris,Les Arts Florissants,2014-11-19,Jenny Gilbert,"Were it not for William Christie and Les Arts Florissants, the vocal and instrumental ensemble he started in Paris in the 1970s, the beauties of the musical French Baroque might have remained a dusty fact of pre-Revolutionary history. As it is, there is barely a singer, player or conductor now performing Lully, Couperin, Rameau, Charpentier et al who has not benefited from the life’s work of this diligent conductor-musicologist. Through him, their arts are indeed flourishing.So a one-off concert at the Barbican, part of a Europe-wide tour to mark the 250th anniversary of the death of Rameau, was a hot ticket – more so since it brought to light two previously neglected one-act opera-ballets, complete with new choreography. To present the music without the dance element would be like serving oysters without champagne. Each enhances the other. They were made to go together.The practicalities, however, present problems, such as where to place the orchestra to achieve the best possible sound while allowing optimum communication with the other performers. The solution chosen in the Barbican Hall was to jam the instrumentalists against the back wall of the stage, allowing a large expanse in front for dancing and singing (pictured below). But this obscured the view, even from a best stalls seat, of the period instruments: wooden flutes that sound more like recorders, quacky period oboes, the droning musette – a miniature bagpipe. At one point the musette player was sent to wander about downstage, but curiosity demanded more.Worse, though, was that Christie sometimes struggled to hold things together. Theatrically, it may have seemed a good idea to erect a temporary screen of swagged drapes on stage to represent a temple. Musically, though, it was disastrous, creating a game of blind-man’s buff in which synchronicity could only be the loser, as the duetting singers on stage delayed their cadences (albeit exquisitely) at odds with Christie and his string section. Several times in the course of the evening you sensed the pulse sliding out of reach like a cake of wet soap as each voice – whether human or instrumental – pursued its own ornamental digressions. It’s a built-in hazard of this music’s complex linearity, which, to be fair, was written to be performed in a much more intimate space (at Fontainbleau, Louis XV’s out-of-town haunt). Safe to say, sluggish ensemble is not a fault you’ll come across among Christie’s 100-plus recordings.Sophie Daneman, the British soprano who has made a distinguished career on the platform, took on the stage direction and, with the exception of that dratted curtain, did it well. The two one-acters, written within a year of each other but never intended as a double bill, are treated as a single entity, with the same soloists in the equivalent roles. This just about works, if you make allowance for the fact that Daphnis et Églé (1753) has a skeleton of a plot and La Naissance d’Osiris (1754) glaringly hasn’t: it’s one of those operas in which everyone simply hangs around and sings for the sake of singing, delivering dim-witted sentiments (to a new-born baby!) such as “Let us render him all the entertainments that peace can offer”. It sounds only slightly better in French. Visually, though, the singers and dancers are nicely integrated, the chorus being allowed to join in some of the simpler ensemble dances, and the stage action slips deftly between sung and danced sections – some 16 in all.Françoise Denieau’s choreography – we can only assume the originals are lost – is appealingly simple and clean. It was, after all, only a few decades earlier, in the court of Louis XIV, that the steps and gestures we now recognise as classical ballet were set in stone. The five positions of the feet and corresponding carriage of the arms were based partly on courtly etiquette – and the fashionable deployment of lace cuffs – and Denieau’s dances are devised as if to illustrate the development from such basics to more intricate chains of movements. The pointe-shoe was still 100 years off, and the heeled lace-up pumps worn by both sexes here give a very particular feel to the steps’ much gentler rise and fall. Contemporary dress, too, adds its own flavour to the dance vocabulary. Alain Blanchot’s costumes are both believable and lovely, avoiding for the most part the full-on Bo-Peep look for the women, and allowing the men the dignity of real masculinity in their knee breeches, jerkins and coloured hose: some of their numbers are highly athletic.In a flash of insight that could only be prompted by a joint project of this kind, you sense a neat correlation between the tension and release of baroque music’s suspensions, and the tension and release of tight-laced bodices and ballooning skirts and sleeves. These costumes also happen to be very flattering to the wearer, aiding the right kind of movement, airy, yet precise. Giving Eros wings constructed of skirt panniers was a witty touch. And the book-ending of the show with the unpacking and re-packing of theatrical props from wooden crates brought a nice sense of completeness and theatricality to two halves that, by 21st-century standards, inherently lacked both. For all its hazards, this is a project that begs to be repeated, if only because it leaves every last spectator wreathed in smiles.",https://theartsdesk.com/dance/daphnis-et-%C3%A9gl%C3%A9la-naissance-dosiris-les-arts-florissants-christie-barbican,4
368,"Glare, Linbury Studio Theatre",Glare,Linbury Studio Theatre,2014-11-15,alexandra Coghlan,"Søren Nils Eichberg’s new opera Glare is advertised as a “taut” thriller. It’s actually a short thriller. Big difference.The question of whether or not opera – a medium that wouldn’t win any prizes for sprinting –  can successfully pull off a thriller – a genre that lives and, more often, dies in its dramatic agility and lightness of foot – is a very real one. I’ve never seen it succeed yet, but would be delighted to be proved wrong. Glare, unfortunately, is not that proof.We find ourselves in the kind of dystopian near-future that only exists on the operatic stage. You know it’s a dystopia because they say “fuck” a lot, and for one significant scene a character carries a six-pack of toilet rolls under her arm. Alex has a new girlfriend, Lea, who is perfect. No, really perfect. So perfect, in fact, that when his mate Michael tells him she’s actually an android that he built, he believes him. And so do we, for over an hour of this 74-minute one-acter.The big twist falls so late in the show – barely a few minutes before the final blackout – that neither characters nor audience have time to react. If Lea really is a machine (and let’s not get drawn into the A-level Philosophy debate that Eichberg and librettist Hannah Dübgen seem to find so profound as to what exactly that might entail), then it’s very hard to care terribly much about her, however nice she is. So when (spoiler alert) we see her raped and eventually murdered it’s impossible to engage the usual ethical reflexes. Every electronic tick and twitch of the score is telling us she’s a robot, so it’s less a coup de theatre than plain old contradiction to suddenly pull the dramatic rug out from under that idea.If the drama feels foreshortened, poised on the edge of potential profundity without quite managing to reach it, it’s certainly not the fault of an excellent cast. Sky Ingram’s Lea (pictured right, with Muchhala and Presland) has a touching gawkiness about her, an intensity that’s heartfelt and yet uncomprehending. Vocally it’s a pretty even match, but Clare Presland’s poised vocal performance as ex-girlfriend Christina – straighter, more bladed than Ingram – just clinches it for me. Amar Muchhala has a nice line in hapless as Alex, Lea’s boyfriend, though battling with some of the score’s less generous vocal writing, and is an easy victim for Ashley Riches’ smooth-singing Michael to manipulate.Director Thaddeus Strassberger, last seen baffling ROH audiences in the recent I Due Foscari, sends down whimsical scatterings of red rose petals from the ceiling and doesn’t do much else, seemingly content to let his singers play an extended game of pool in the middle of Madeleine Boyd’s angular, warehouse-loft-pre-conversion set (when the drama on the table rivals that on the wider stage, you know you’re in trouble). Eichberg’s score is all digital scuttlings and rustlings, blending live acoustic forces with electronics whose symbolism can occasionally seem rather literal, especially when robot-Lea buzzes with feedback. Contemporary-specialists CHROMA are as tight as ever under conductor Geoffrey Paterson’s direction, mining every speck of Scandi-cool from episodic music whose foundations are in theme-and-variations and leitmotif but whose embellishments flirt with electronica, dance and rock music.Glare is less an operatic thriller than a parable – one too busy teaching to remember to thrill. The stakes simply aren’t high enough, the singing figures before us so plausibly, so nearly human, but not quite.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/glare-linbury-studio-theatre,3
369,"Cristina, Regina di Svezia, Chelsea Opera Group, Cadogan Hall",Cristina,Regina di Svezia,2014-11-09,David Nice,"One queen is much like another in so-called “historical” Italian early to mid 19th-century opera. Elizabeth of England, Christina of Sweden, take your pick, they all fall for a tenor courtier who loves Another (the seconda donna, soprano or mezzo). With Donizetti, the musical drama is almost as disposable as the plot until a stonking number or two rolls up. Jacopo Foroni, more or less unknown until Wexford resurrected him a year ago, has a few more felicitous orchestral touches but nothing as memorable as Donizetti's best. Cristina, regina di Svezia served at Wexford, and last night in concert at the behest of the splendid Chelsea Opera Group, as a star vehicle for Australian soprano Helena Dix, who, with a Metropolitan Opera cover just in the bag, seems about to make it big.And in New York she probably will: the opera queens just love this sort of all-guns-firing, generous diva with the right top notes. If I’m a little more reserved in my enthusiasm, it’s because I’m not sure the bright soprano sound is entirely ballasted: I wanted a bit more tone colour, more precision in the brief coloratura which there’s so much more of in Donizetti, and for that matter in the role of Elvira in Verdi’s Ernani, which Dix is covering at the Met. In the odd and indiscriminate shape of Foroni’s opera, she starts off crowning the sort of big ensembles Verdi knew better to place at the centre of the drama (here, in typical overkill but lots of work for the chorus, there are plenty more to come). And she rises regally to Christina’s dilemma of abdication which makes this a bigger drama than the usual in the genre, a final showdown of duty versus love which foreshadows in situation, but certainly not in the clunky libretto or the one-size-fits-all music, Verdi’s Don Carlos.COG always casts from strength. Here it already had two perfect foils ready-made from Wexford in the less demanding roles of lover and rival: fully Italianate sounding (and looking) American tenor John Bellemer as Gabriele de la Gardie, and the most stylish singer on the concert platform, mezzo Lucia Cirillo, as Maria Eufrosinia, making a perfunctory duet early on in the drama seem interesting (the two pictured at Wexford above). Top marks for style and meaning, too, as always, to veteran David Wilson-Johnson as a Lord High Chancellor well attuned to the sensitivities of a better number, with Dix equally sympathetic at this stage. William Dazeley might be pushing it one step too far as Italianate baritone, arriving late on the scene in the odd dramatic structure, but he gave the cadenza of Carlo Gustavo’s Act Two aria his all.Comprimario parts all did honour to their contributions. As for the COG Orchestra and Chorus, I’ve never heard them sound better under the ardent baton of Andrew Greenwood (Deborah Miles-Johnson, too, deserves credit for transforming the dedicated amateur choristers). The orchestra actually made me sit up and listen for the only two memorable melodies. The first, in the opening Sinfonia, had me racking my brains for where I’d heard it and the light flashed just before the first scene – it’s the sad ditty sung by Ophelia in Ambroise Thomas’s Hamlet, and the programme note cites it as a popular Swedish tune, the Näckens Polka. The other was a real surprise: in the Act Two introduction, transporting us to an island in the Swedish archipelago, was the rich chordal sequence of Liszt’s “Harmonies du Soir”. A borrowing by Foroni, probably, rather than a plagiarism on Liszt’s part, as the first version of what became the Études d’exécution transcendante first appeared in 1838 and Cristina's Stockholm world premiere followed 11 years later.These touches certainly piqued interest. For the rest, it was enough to accept that no touch of genius was going to emerge and to enjoy the sheer energy and dedication of the performance – at levels rather deafening in the confines of the Cadogan Hall – as best one could. It's surely time, though, to place Foroni’s Queen Christina back in her coffin.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/cristina-regina-di-svezia-chelsea-opera-group-cadogan-hall,3
370,"The Cunning Peasant, Guildhall School",The Cunning Peasant,Guildhall School,2014-11-06,David Nice,"Dvořák’s rustic operetta sits, swinging its legs rather diffidently, historically somewhere between the neverland Bohemia of Smetana’s The Bartered Bride and the lacerating reality of village life in Janáček'’s Jenůfa. The Cunning Peasant’s charms lie in its string of sophisticated songs and dances, more through-composed than Smetana’s, and in the abundance of not over-taxing roles, as well as chorus numbers, it offers to students.That the Guildhall School embraces these so cheerfully has much to do with the way that fine, underrated conductor Dominic Wheeler effortlessly drives the tractor, slipping from one delicious metre into another, from polka to country waltz, with real panache. The ensemble May Day celebrations go with a rough edged swing; the choreography, by Richard Jones’s right-hand woman Sarah Fahie, makes it look spontaneous, with plenty of merry noises from the participants, but weaves beguiling patterns in the seeming mayhem.Director Stephen Medcalf has a harder job maintaining interest in a non-plot over two hours, and sometimes over-eggs the lecherous pudding, not least when a randy Prince/Duke makes none too subtle gestures with a phallic delphinium, but he keeps it on the move. The names have been changed from Dvořák’s Czechia to Hardy’s Wessex – heroine Bétuška becomes Bathsheba, her father Martin, the not-so-cunning peasant, Gabriel, and so on – but they forgot to tell designer Francis O’Connor, whose skewed houses remain distinctly Mittel-European, or rather perhaps a country version of Wagner’s Nuremberg (ensemble scene pictured below).What happens, then? Our pretty peasant girl is pursued by four men: one who wants to marry her but has no money, three others who need tripping up: a rich suitor she doesn’t want – characterized here as a local Jew, plausible in Bohemia but less so in Wessex – a philandering Duke and his comic valet. As the plot introduces the aristocracy and makes a nod to The Marriage of Figaro, Medcalf tries to make the Duke more of a shit than Dvořák's music paints him, and sees a threat in the all-too-happily restored status quo at the end, but the score can’t take it. The problem is that there’s none of the deeper shades which make a great comedy. Even Smetana injected pathos in The Bartered Bride’s great last-act quintet and soprano aria; Dvořák has sentiment but no depth, and nor do any of the characters.The girls do best. The second-cast Bathsheba, Laura Ruhi-Vidal, has effortless stage presence and glows by the time of the second-act duet – this sounds like a Strauss Sophie in the making – but her tenor love, the Joseph of Lawrence Thackeray, has only two modes, loud and falsetto; it’s a promising voice, but it needs a core. So, more seriously, does Martin Hässler's as the Duke (pictured right with Ruhi-Vidal): handsome on stage but lacking solid support, without which most notes were out of true last night. There’s work worth doing here, but it seems irresponsible of the Guildhall to give him a Schubert Winterreise before the public at this stage. No such caveats apply to his zesty “wife”, Alison Langer, Emma Kerr’s housekeeper or Anna Gillingham’s maid: with Ruhi-Vidal, they bring down the Act One curtain with a delightful “Merry Women of Wessex” quartet.Two more tenors show promise, Robin Bailey as the suitor and John Findon, stepping in as valet John: less would be more in terms of the mugging, and the accent is no more successful than Langer's in a kind of Countess-impersonates-Susanna deception scene – since Ruhi-Vidal doesn’t adopt one in the first place, the point is lost – but some amazing sounds pop out at times. A bit more polish is needed from David Shipley’s harsh dad, too, though the raw material is certainly there. The ladies of the chorus sound superb, while not all the men know their words (nothing new there). There’s much simple pleasure to be had here, but next time let’s have a real Dvořák corker like the later Devil and Kate.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/cunning-peasant-guildhall-school,3
371,"Levsha, Mariinsky Opera, Barbican Hall",Levsha,Mariinsky Opera,2014-11-05,alexandra Coghlan,"Of course unavoidable circumstances do strike, and concerts do get delayed, but it’s astonishing just how often those circumstances seem to conspire against Valery Gergiev. Last night’s UK premiere of Rodion Shchedrin’s opera Levsha – the second night of a Mariinsky triptych of performances at the Barbican – started a nice round hour late, which was a real shame because once the drama shifted from offstage to onstage the work revealed itself as a bit of a gem.Based on a story by Nikolai Leskov (he of Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District), the opera’s plot is less about unfolding narrative than establishing a series of curious situations and conceits. These are hung, bauble-like, on a tale that sees Tsar Nicholas I fascinated by a tiny mechanical flea, capable of marvellous feats, presented to his brother, the previous Tsar, by the English court. Determined to prove the superiority of Russia’s craftsmen, Nicholas sets Levsha (""Left-Hander""), an uneducated but brilliant country mechanic, the task of improving upon it. Dispatched to England to demonstrate his skill, Levsha’s return to Russia is threatened by his lack of papers, and the ailing man is sent to an infirmary where he shortly dies.From the glittering metallic brilliance of the opening bars, scored for wriggling, piccolo-dominated woodwind and brass, we are left in no doubt of the real hero of the piece. The flea might be invisible to the naked eye, but it is her music which dominates, glinting and scampering through a score colourful with marimba, vibraphone, whistle, chimes and bells. Even a harpsichord adds its mechanistic clatter to the scene, coming into its own in the delicate mockery of Shchedrin’s musical pastiche of the court of George I (pictured below, Shchedrin and Gergiev congratulate each other with Kristina Alieva, Andrey Popov, Maria Maksakova and Ekaterina Krapivina looking on).The composer’s magpie-score reveals him no less in thrall to curiosity and sensation than his Tsar. One moment things are pure Prokofiev, all sardonic brass and orchestral rhetoric, then we’re among the glowing Orthodox choirs of Rachmaninov and Gretchaninov. The story’s many cameos are rendered in delicate little musical pen-and-ink sketches – some caricatures, others something more sincere.A trio of English courtiers (Dmitry Koleyshko, Mikhail Latyshev and Vladimir Zhivopistsev, pictured above with Kristina Alieva's Flea, Vladimir Moroz's Alexander I and Maria Maksakova's Princess Charlotte) speak as one, a united froth of pomp and self-importance, while two English brides wheeled out to lure Levshka to stay in London (Ekaterina Krapivina, Marina Aleshonkova) coax and ooze with sensual promise. A female duet representing “The Voice of Russia” (exquisitely sung by Ekaterina Goncharova and Yulia Matochkina) offers a recurring point of stillness and nostalgia – a warmly human reminder of a folk-simplicity disregarded in the Tsar’s quest for ever more sophisticated novelty.That the Mariinsky can field so strong a cast of singer-actors in these smaller roles is a sign of what it can still achieve at its best. Principals too made quite an impression, led by the unlikely couple of Andrey Popov’s wide-eyed, impeccably sung Levsha (pictured right) and Kristina Alieva’s Flea. How inspired a conceit to transform this creature into a singing role – a coloratura soprano whose icy brilliance and charm offers an unusual leading lady for this Russian Pygmalion. A smile dancing perpetually around her lips, demure and rigid, no automaton could have been more accurate or bewitching than Alieva. Set against the straining and passionate humanity of Popov (Shchedrin delights in cruelly high passages for his craftsman), her coolness comes into its own, with a further delicious foil found in Maria Maksakova’s Princess Charlotte – so ripe a creature as to make the Duchess of Cambridge seem like a duenna.The score does have its weaknesses; there’s a bagginess to the drama that could easily lose half an hour and not miss it, and a disregard for dramatic arc that sets us off at a crawl thanks to a lengthy flashback. Levsha feels like a trim one-acter – or at any rate a single-sitting, no-interval affair – that has been over-weighted by too much enthusiasm. It’s an impression heightened by Gergiev and the Mariinsky Orchestra, who deliver a ferociously precise account that occasionally hammers when it should tap, declaims when it should whisper a wicked aside.Small quibbles, however, for an evening of fine musical entertainment. It’s rare that a new score can compel so thoroughly at first hearing. Russia’s greatest living opera composer has done it again, creating a contemporary classic that really gets under the skin.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/levsha-mariinsky-opera-barbican-hall,4
372,"Idomeneo, Royal Opera",Idomeneo,Royal Opera,2014-11-04,David Nice,"God-sent sea monsters and divinely ordained human sacrifices don’t wash well with opera updated. The favoured contemporary take on the post-Trojan War myth of Mozart’s Idomeneo, which may even have originated in the last Covent Garden production 25 years ago by a fitfully brilliant Johannes Schaaf, has been to put a populace at risk from natural disaster and pestilence. Clearly the programme was expecting something of the sort, with its images of Hurricane Katrina. But no, for director Martin Kušej, the only monster is the state.Chuck out a cosmic dimension in favour of power struggles, though, and they’d better not be petty or ludicrous, as they are in this case with posturing blokes in black suits and reflector specs, a hardly threatening bunch of Goth-priests – all the Goths I’ve met have been such nice people underneath – and weedy red-wrapped revolutionaries. There’s not a moment of human truth in this production, which makes it very hard on the singers.Take the central relationship. To appease Neptune, a king must sacrifice the first human being he sees on landing in Crete, which happens to be his own son. But Kušej’s Idomeneo is not the one of Mozart’s old libretto, torn between love and compulsion. He wants libertarian Idamante dead: obstacle number one to the music’s polarities of severity and tenderness. Obstacle number two: no-one really loves anyone else, but everyone seems keen to get off with each other. Tacky, especially when Idamante succumbs to the clichéd straddling-to-hysterical-vocals of wild Elettra. And come the monster-attack, the chorus is singing about running and hiding from the Great Terror when they’re rooted to the spot by the daft johnnies with guns – one of three weak curtains (the first involves a giant rubber shark, just about the only representative of the all-important sea, pictured above). Annette Murschetz’s revolving black and white cubes and walls, a marine-free zone, say nothing to me about the nature of the drama.It’s difficult to believe in Mozart's first through-composed masterpiece, its generosity, rifts and dazzling woodwind elaboration, when the motivation is so uncertain. Glorious Sophie Bevan starts out on top form, clear of Italian diction and expression as captive Trojan princess Ilia, but as her morals start to slide – prospective dad-in-law tries it on, she seems to like it but isn’t sure and nor are we – so does interest in her character, at least until the great Act Three Quartet, which she crowns superbly. Malin Byström’s Elettra is vocally less well-defined, but she’s there for the thrilling, if ultimately wearing, upper range – and she looks stylish in black and white, if going nowhere with it.Strong tenor Matthew Polenzani’s Idomeneo (pictured left with Bevan's Ilia) not only sings the coloratura-free, tame version of his centrepiece aria ""Fuor del mar"" but has the conviction in his voice sapped by the physical uncertainty with which Kušej saddles him: like everyone else, he just paces the stage ineffectively. A second tenor, Stanislas de Barbeyrac, is asked to bring eccentricity – bust accordion, eye patch, woolly hat, why? – to dull counsellor Arbace. He sings his heart out for the aria that begins Act Two, but it’s still Mozart’s most perfunctory number. Argentinian counter-tenor Franco Fagioli is no actor, and who wants to hear an Idamante who bottles up top rather than opening out, as every mezzo I’ve heard in the role has managed to do, and with more masculine welly, too? Bring on Alice Coote, Christine Rice, Sarah Connolly; don’t foist a Mozart counter-tenor on us again, please.Chorus and orchestra are vivid, but hampered at times – the players by the mannerisms of Marc Minkowski, who of all authenticists manages to over-romanticise Mozart, however authoritatively, and abetted by clunky continuo playing; the singers by Kušej trusting them so little that he sticks at the front of the stage an expensive group of 27 actors to do what the chorus could surely achieve with good direction. You expect the action men to leap into action for the ballet at the end of the opera, often cut; here we get part of it, but to a revolve of miserable, oppressed children – the ones in white who puzzled us during Elettra's first aria – and adults turned to stone by the ongoing cycle of tyranny: a suitably frigid conclusion to a dud staging of zero human interest. Don't get me wrong: good Regietheater, like Schaaf's Idomeneo here back in 1989, can challenge and inspire, but this is the sort of thing that gives the genre a bad name.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/idomeneo-royal-opera,2
373,"Betrothal in a Monastery, Maryinsky Opera, Cardiff",Betrothal in a Monastery,Maryinsky Opera,2014-11-03,stephen Walsh,"It’s one of the ironies of life and art that Prokofiev’s tenderest and most romantic opera was composed at a time when he was abandoning his wife in favour of a Moscow literature student half his age. Betrothal in a Monastery is a setting in Russian of an opera libretto by Sheridan about the attempt of a Spanish grandee to marry off his young daughter to an elderly fish merchant. Like most comic operas, and some not so comic, it’s set in Seville; the wife Prokofiev was walking out on was Spanish.The trauma of such events naturally plays little or no part in the opera, which is a comedy of disguise and mistaken identity in the tradition of Rossini’s Barber and Donizetti’s Don Pasquale. It hangs on the usual devices of characters engaged to people they’ve never set eyes on, or incapable of recognising their own fiancée in a borrowed cloak, with the added element of a Spanish code of honour so strict that a girl will take the veil rather than forgive her lover for entering her bedroom innocently but uninvited.You might suppose that such a farrago would depend on stage and costume to bring it to life. But it was precisely part of the fun of the Maryinsky’s performance under Valery Gergiev in Cardiff’s Wales Millennium Centre on Sunday that the semi-staging glossed over all such superficial details and instead threw itself into the situations provoked by the underlying confusions of motivation and the vitality of the individual characters. Even the fish merchant Mendoza’s beard, which is talked about so often that it almost assumes a separate identity (like the nose in Shostakovich’s opera), remained invisible on the highly mobile face of Sergey Aleksashkin, who certainly did sport luxuriant facial hair when he sang the role a few years ago at Glyndebourne.The magic ingredient that transforms this nonsense into memorable theatre is of course Prokofiev’s music, some of the wittiest and at the same time most lyrically engaging in any comic opera of the last century. Why on earth such an enchanting piece hasn’t entered the repertory of every self-respecting opera company is one of the mysteries of modern arts planning. It has pace, authentic musical humour, melody such as everyone knows to have been at Prokofiev’s command more or less at will; the vocal writing is exquisite and stylish, the orchestration not just expert but full of invention – a comedy of sound in its own right.No doubt the work has suffered from its Soviet connections. It was composed in 1940, by which time Prokofiev had been fully reabsorbed into post-purge Russia (Vsevolod Meyerhold, who had been due to direct Prokofiev’s previous opera, Semyon Kotko, had been murdered by the NKVD five months before). Yet the taint of Stalin hasn’t inhibited the popularity of Romeo and Juliet or the Fifth Symphony, works close in time and idiom to Betrothal. Perhaps in the end the Russian language, with its strange alphabet and (supposedly) coarse rhetoric, is to blame. Luckily, there are now wonderful Russian singers around to disprove such silliness, and there was a full gallery of them on show at this performance.Aleksashkin and Evgeny Akimov (as the cash-strapped grandee Don Jerome) set the tone in their sparkling opening exchanges on the subject of fish and young wives – comparable topics in Mendoza’s eyes. There was no credit in the programme for the well-oiled front-of-stage action (perhaps by Vladislav Pazi, who directed the Maryinsky production currently in rep); but it deserved one, not least because it brought the singers close to the audience, a contact evidently relished by both parties. Dmitry Voropaev sang the tenor/lover Don Antonio’s serenade with lovely, effortless tone; Anastasia Kalagina (pictured right) was coolly charming and light-voiced as his beloved Louisa, Mendoza’s marital target, though he is (rather easily, it may seem) tricked into marrying the duenna of Sheridan’s title, played here with a nice blend of dignity and self-parody by Larisa Diadkova.This is an opera with many supporting roles, not all of them obviously essential to the plot. Louisa’s friend Clara seems mainly there to provide vocal contrast, but has one beautiful aria in the convent to which she retreats, a rare passage of inwardness which Yulia Matochkina – a somewhat static actress – dispatched with marvellous warmth of tone. Roman Burdenko played her lover (Louisa’s brother, Ferdinand, also a target for Don Jerome’s nuptial ambitions) as a mildly ineffectual figure who might put up token resistance to paternal pressure. Evgeny Ulanov came and went as the priggish, well-meaning but prurient Don Carlos, without ever quite establishing a significant role in the drama.On top of all this, Prokofiev introduced elements of commedia dell’arte as in his much earlier Love of Three Oranges. The revellers, servants and drunken monks all come in threes, like Puccini’s Ping, Pang and Pong, sung here with growing enthusiasm by Andrey Popov, Yury Vlasov and Alexander Gerasimov. And the Maryiinsky caravan also includes a chorus of fishwives and assorted wedding guests, along (naturally) with the wonderful orchestra, all of whom plainly enjoyed the show almost as much as the audience – presenting us with the unfamiliar sight of a smiling body of Russian musicians. Gergiev, running late as usual, held everything together with great aplomb. He obviously loves the work, and he made us love it too.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/betrothal-monastery-maryinsky-opera-cardiff,5
374,"La Bohème, English National Opera",La Bohème,English National Opera,2014-10-30,David Nice,"ENO may not always have matched the Royal Opera in the Great Puccini Voices stakes. But it's served up many of the classiest Mimìs, with Valerie Masterson, Mary Plazas and Elizabeth Llewellyn as top seamstresses. Californian former beauty queen Angel Blue, an acclaimed Musetta in the previous revival, now joins them. Unlike Llewellyn, still awaiting the international recognition she deserves, Blue is also among the favoured roster of young sopranos who, after an interregnum where we wondered where all the best black opera singers had gone - whether the spell of Leontyne Price and Jessye Norman on a younger generation had faded - are now firmly in the limelight. Like South Africans Pretty Yende and Pumeza Matshikiza, she lives up to the hype.Does this second revival of Jonathan Miller’s production by Natascha Metherell live up to Blue, though? Musically, yes. There’s just as much to celebrate in the hyper-poetic Rodolfo of Somerset-born David Butt Philip, a lyric-dramatic tenor recently graduated from the Royal Opera’s Jette Parker Young Artists Programme who’s already made his mark in the role on the Glyndebourne tour as well as in a cameo role in Die Frau ohne Schatten. These two lovers are young, personable and technically flawless. You think at first hearing that Butt Philip’s seemingly lightish lyric might have trouble opening out up top, but not a bit of it; he and Blue absolutely dominate the ensembles of the brilliant Café Momus scene. He also uses breath control to produce some phrases that seem to go on for ever; I’ve never heard the duet of regret at lost love in the last act more lustrously launched.Similarly, there’s a question-mark whether Blue’s distinctive vibrato might get in the way of the long lines, but she negotiates them in true Italianate style, a rose in full bloom as the translation at one point describes Mimì. I’d like a little more scaling-down, some perfect pianissimi, though she does finally achieve them in a death scene of moving restraint (pictured above with Butt Philip and Jennifer Holloway's Musetta).But oh, how much more touching and real these young lovers would be if the production gave them more to work on. It’s a typical Miller offering, all window-dressing and no fine detail; the early 1930s setting adds nothing but stiff women’s hair-dos and a lazy nod at Brassai – what, sex on sale on a February dawn? The return to trad laziness after the late, often inspired Steven Pimlott’s ENO staging which preceded it is especially disappointing. Fine, the singers must have been told less is more: Blue never overdoes the coughing, for instance. But like Amanda Holden’s unusually infelicitous translation, the staging replaces nuance with generalization. It’s a failure, for instance, not to have Rodolfo fleck the fainting Mimì’s face with the drops of water we hear in the orchestral pizzicati, or at least to replace it with an equivalent; nothing is happening here. And focused physical energy is needed for all the entrances in Acts One and Two to match the music’s vigour; on stage, the subdued arrivals are so inert.Even so, we get some personality from the other Bohemians. George von Bergen needs more exuberance and a tighter vocal control, but we know his Marcello is a good sort; George Humphreys relates Schaunard’s tale of trying to kill a troublesome parrot by ceaseless fiddling charmingly, with vivid diction and likeable presence; and Barnaby Rea, though he doesn’t sound like a real bass to me, delivers Colline’s arietta about selling his beloved overcoat with real subtlety and sweetness. The singer most in need of directorial loosening-up is Jennifer Holloway’s Musetta, all sharp angles when she should be wrapping herself round old lover Marcello (strange, too, to cast a mezzo as a character who vocally sometimes rises above Mimì’s line, though the top notes aren't at all bad).Gianluca Marcianò is in total command of the score, achieving the rare distinction of making the ENO Orchestra sound Italianate towards the lyric climaxes. His view of the score isn’t exactly mine; I’d like more continuity, less lingering, in Puccini’s fluid perfectionism. But it’s a fine piece of work. I suspect he must have cursed the ineptitude of the first and fourth act “curtains”; it’s an elementary mistake to have the sceneshifters in 1930s workers’ garb come on to swivel the garret into café scenery before the last bars of moonshine have faded at the end of Rodolfo’s and Mimì’s duet, and for heaven’s sake don’t begin to bring down a curtain before the final despair has subsided. Handsome and malleable as Isabella Bywater's Paris streetset undoubtedly is (end of Act Three pictured above), it's also a cop-out to see who's coming up the stairs to the garret; Musetta's breathless announcement that the dying Mimi has come back, powerfully timed by Puccini, for instance, is defused.This revival has some truly great singing, but it could have delivered the full package with encouragement of top-notch singing-acting too.Compared to Richard Jones's concurrent ENO production of Puccini's The Girl of the Golden West, it's a dramatic dud saved only by the intelligence of its fine cast. Good news, though, that Jones will be in charge of the Royal Opera Bohème to replace John Copley's ancient production, even fustier than Miller's: now that should be a whole different story.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-boh%C3%A8me-english-national-opera-1,3
375,"Wozzeck, BBCSSO, Runnicles, City Halls, Glasgow",Wozzeck,BBCSSO,2014-10-24,Christopher Lambton,"It takes a brave man to programme a single performance of Berg’s Wozzeck on a damp Thursday evening in Glasgow. But Donald Runnicles is such a man. In his five years at the helm of the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra he has proved adept at making the implausible possible, and turning the ordinary into something extraordinary. With the BBC in support, and its renewed commitment to recording and broadcasting from all corners of the UK, Runnicles (pictured in rehearsal below) is maybe not so much brave as canny – he has a showman’s eye for a concert programme that will challenge and entertain; one that breaks the mould yet still brings in a crowd.And so it was that a decent audience filed into Glasgow’s City Halls for this semi-staged Wozzeck. It’s worth mentioning that although it was not a full house, this was a young and excitable gathering, by classical concert standards, with an unusually high proportion of famous composers and festival directors in its midst. If this were Mahler’s Fifth, I observed to my neighbour, the hall would be full. “Well I suppose it’s more like Mahler’s 17th,” was his perspicacious reply.As befits Runnicles the showman, this was a flamboyant Wozzeck. The vast orchestra filled one half of the hall. Double timpani, two bass drums, an assortment of percussion, piano, celesta, accordion and a small army of brass and strings created a magnificent sound that came close to saturation in a hall that feels bigger than it really is (it has less than half the audience capacity of Edinburgh’s Usher Hall, for instance). Berg’s extraordinary orchestration, under Runnicles, was in vivid Technicolor. Menace and frivolity churn restlessly beneath the surface of the tavern music as Marie (Elena Zhidkova) and the Drum Major (Thomas Blondelle) dance under the fatally jealous eye of Wozzeck (Thomas J Mayer replacing Roman Trekel at short notice). The orchestral crescendi that follow Marie’s anguished “Don’t touch me!” were both massive and wonderfully rich – not just noise but layers and layers of repressed violence.As a befits a semi-staged performance there was some limited direction by Kenneth Richardson, with the action confined to a narrow stage extension behind the conductor’s podium. Although there was little attempt at realism (Marie scuttled off after being murdered), this arrangement allows a bit more flexibility than concert performances where it is impossible to pass behind the conductor. One of the apprentices was sufficiently in character to stagger in from the wings and offer his brandy bottle to the pianist for a swig as he filed past. All the cast sang from memory, which is probably the single most important difference between this and opera recitals where the acting is little more than gestures from behind a music stand. Readers who spot the microphones in the photographs can be reassured that no-one was amplified: these were for the BBC’s recording engineers to capture singers who seldom stood still in front of the fixed microphones.The set consisted of an IKEA bench and the props little more than a notebook clutched by the doctor (Nathan Berg). Costumes were everyday, with the exception of a flowing red dress worn by Elena Zhidkova's Marie (pictured right with Blondelle). There were some limited lighting effects, including a vivid red moon projected on the back wall. Also on the back wall was the surtitle machine, difficult to read thanks to the profusion of hanging microphone cables. This is something that in future could easily be rectified.With limited scope for the stage director to interfere with the opera, it was the music that sold this show. And although it sounds glib I can truthfully say that there was not a single performance less than excellent, and that includes all the soloists, about 20 of the BBC Singers, and a small children’s choir from St Mary’s Cathedral in Edinburgh, whose gruesome task it is to make us realise at the end of the opera that we have witnessed not just a great work of art but a terrible crime. Rumour has it that Runnicles was delighted to secure his replacement Wozzeck – together with Marie he led a stellar cast that also included Tom Randle, Michael Pflumm, and Jennifer Johnston. We are unlikely to witness so audacious and brilliant an operatic performance in Scotland for some time, but many in the audience will wonder if this could mark the beginning of something new, a means of witnessing live such operas that lie outside the current financial or artistic scope of Scottish Opera. Let us hope that Runnicles is encouraged to do more.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/wozzeck-bbcsso-runnicles-city-halls-glasgow,5
376,"Life on the Moon, English Touring Opera",Life on the Moon,English Touring Opera,2014-10-18,David Nice,"You may be more familiar with the Italian title, Il mondo della luna, but chances are you won’t have seen this or any of Haydn’s other 16 operas. You haven’t missed much, at least until the last of his works as court composer to the Esterházy family, Armida, an ""heroic drama"" rather than the slim comedies which don’t seem to have inspired the composer to the heights of his symphonies and string quartets. Glyndebourne failed to trigger a revival with La fedeltà premiata in 1979 – my first acquaintance with the house as a teenager; young Simon Rattle was conducting – and more recently the Royal Opera staged L’anima del filosofo ossia Orfeo ed Euridice, the one extra-Esterházy opus, as a vehicle for Cecilia Bartoli.Should English Touring Opera have bothered with Life on the Moon, which started out last night with one performance only at the Hackney Empire? Everyone tries hard, sometimes too hard in the would-be knockabout staging of Cal McCrystal, “Physical Comedy Director” of the irrepressible One Man, Two Guvnors. It wasn’t a bad idea to get him to work on another piece originating in a Goldoni plot – the Venetian comic master’s libretto already had several settings by the time Haydn got hold of it in 1777 – but few singers are born to master disciplined slapstick. With the exception of a laugh-out-loud routine as Ronan Busfield’s servant Cecco keeps on dropping a telescope leg every time he tries to pick another up, repetition palls.A lot of fleshing out is needed for a slender plot in which a miserly widower, turned into a sexist old lech in ETO General Director James Conway’s translation, finds himself gulled by a quack astronomer into believing that there’s a better life, including hot running girls 40 years his junior, on the moon. Conway, whose rhyming couplets for the recitative are better and funnier than the sometimes ungainly word-setting of the arias and ensembles, has pared away a second miser’s daughter and her boyfriend, but McCrystal doesn’t seem inclined to take the principal lovers seriously. Soprano Jane Harrington has to wearily upstage her own bravura as Clarice, while Martha Jones as her father’s maid Lisetta (pictured above on the right with Harrington, Christopher Turner and Busfield) – though she gets some nice tripping 6/8 passages – struggles to take on the role, and the interminable aria, of Lunar Empress.The men fare better. Stalwart bass Andrew Slater rolls out a frog-footman comic turn as old bore Buonafede, presumably meant to be deliberately unpleasant beyond opera buffa bounds at times, and Busfield flashes a nice set of teeth in the constant upstaging with which McCrystal entrusts him; but the most stylish of the bunch is Christopher Turner as Ecclitico (eclipse, get it?), whose lyric-tenor phrasing gives his first big aria more grace than its typically generic material really deserves.He’s part of a triumvirate which really saves the evening. Harpsichordist turned conductor Christopher Bucknall, a pillar of the period-instrument scene, injects life into every line from the spirited Old Street Band, with horns especially fine in thrusting home the minor-key anger of duped Buonafede in the act two finale. And designer takis (sic) complements rather ravishing 18th-century silks in the first act with lunatic caprices on their styles and wacky hats as the formal garden is transfigured into an all-white moon. So time passes not unpleasantly, and certainly less tediously than in Glyndebourne’s production of Mozart’s La finta giardiniera – composed two years before Il mondo della luna, when Mozart was 19 and Haydn 43. That staging is also set for a UK tour. Life on the Moon may not have the Counterfeit Garden-Girl’s sudden depths, but it’s never less than a professional job on Haydn’s part. You just won’t come out humming any of the tunes.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/life-moon-english-touring-opera,3
377,"The Marriage of Figaro, English National Opera",The Marriage of Figaro,English National Opera,2014-10-17,alexandra Coghlan,"To take Figaro – the ultimate operatic assault on class distinctions and social hierarchies – and set it on a giant revolve is a gesture as wilful as it is elegant. Not only are divisions of above and below-stairs dissolved in this steadily circling world, but also those of background and foreground, onstage and offstage. By the time the set’s rotations revealed two young valets with their trousers down, relieving themselves up against a palace wall, some few minutes into the Overture, Fiona Shaw had already won her audience and her case.When we first encountered Shaw’s production in 2011 – all rams’ skulls and robust humour – it had a wit that emerged from an almost overwhelming attention to musical detail, gesture narrating score with clinging specificity. Three years on and the show has loosened up; less concerned with proving to us how well it understands the music, it now lives it with a gusto that’s purer Mozart than any amount of filigree fussiness.It helps that this time round Shaw has a cast that’s pretty close to perfect – an ensemble of young singers bringing the same urgency and intensity to the situation as their characters. Last night saw an astonishing four role debuts. The Count (Benedict Nelson), Susanna (Mary Bevan), Figaro (David Stout) and Cherubino (Samantha Price) all took their parts for the first time – particularly striking in the case of Bevan who, just three years ago, was playing Barbarina in this same production.The result is deliciously and joyously vivid, a show that sticks two (immaculately gloved) fingers up at all those who mutter darkly about London not being large enough to support two opera houses. This Figaro epitomises everything that ENO should be in a city that also houses the Royal Opera: a theatrical performance whose dramatic currency just happens to be song; an ensemble event in which voice is an extension of character rather than a replacement for it; an English-language production whose libretto translates the spirit instead of the text of the original.Jeremy Sams’ English libretto deserves a moment in the spotlight. Pirouetting verbally with the same skill as the productions’ visuals, it’s neat without ever getting too contrived. Punchlines always make their landings, rhymes unfold with just enough surprises to keep your wits about you, and above all it just feels natural (if your everyday dialogue were just that little bit sharper and funnier, that is).Shorn of its open-vowelled Italian, the opera takes on a different character. Just as the recitative becomes more clipped, more consonant-driven, so the action sharpens its bladed edge. Shaw’s comedy sits right on the edge of farce, and that in its truest sense not of pratfalls and bedroom antics (though there are plenty of those two) but of suppressed violence and rage. The revolution may find itself relocated to a domestic sphere here, but pins, letters and hats proves themselves no less deadly than any amount of weaponry.This underlying violence is heightened by Benedict Nelson’s Count (pictured above), who suppresses as much as he releases, a man stalking the borderlands of his own civilised humanity. But even Nelson’s dominant presence meets its match in David Stout (pictured below with Bevan) – a likeable, comedic Figaro with more of the Barbiere about him than we might expect, something that’s mirrored across the production as a whole. The trade-off is a garden scene that lacks the stakes of some, whose slower pace and softer mood is dulled by the technicolour delight of all that has come before.This lack was less evident before, largely thanks to the quiet tragedy of Kate Valentine’s Countess. In Sarah-Jane Brandon’s hands she is – though strongly sung –  a fond featherweight, not fully believable in her final rejection. In Price and Bevan however she has co-conspirators of anarchic delight. Price is a real find – gangling and charming, awkwardly loveable and with a legato you could balance your tea-cup on – and any superlatives should also include Lucy Schaufer’s feisty Marcellina and a very fine Barbarina from Ellie Laugharne.  But the show belongs to Bevan.Presented with the Critics’ Circle Award for Exceptional Young Talent (an award her sister Sophie also won in 2012) onstage after the performance, this felt a lot like the singer’s graduation – a promotion to a role she was made to play. Pert and pretty as any Susanna, under Shaw’s direction Bevan also has a no-nonsense vigour about her, and we more than believe her sly declaration that “women of my class don’t get headaches”. A singing actress of the most instinctive kind, Bevan renders specifics about voice irrelevant: this is a performance that must be judged as a whole.Fiona Shaw’s Figaro matches Mozart’s blow for blow – a revival that’s lighter, tighter and brighter than the show’s first outing, and one that’s well worth coming back for. More importantly, though, it’s a production that anyone who’s never been to the opera should see. If this doesn’t convince them of the humour and humanity of this brilliant art-form, I really don’t know what will.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/marriage-figaro-english-national-opera-0,5
378,"I Due Foscari, Royal Opera",I Due Foscari,Royal Opera,2014-10-15,Sebastian Scotney,"First the good news. At 73, is Plácido Domingo anywhere near retiring? Er, no. When the question came up in an interview on Sunday (on video below), he answered : ""The reason I don't retire is because I can still sing."" And then with a glint in his eye: ""I still feel I have to know the the right moment. Not to sing one day more.... nor one day less.""And more good news: Domingo does give an affecting performance as Francesco, the aged Doge of Venice in I Due Foscari, in a rather staid and conservative globe-trotting production of Verdi's early opera, which has also also been seen in Los Angeles, Valencia and Vienna. Domingo's character is tragically trapped virtually throughout the piece by the civic duty to stand back, as political machinations encircle him, and condemn his son to exile and death.It is a role without the light of hope. Just as Verdi himself in the years before 1840 had lost two children in their infancy, and his first wife Margherita Barezzi had also died, in I Due Foscari there are frequent, poignant mentions of the fact that his son Jacopo has been the only one to survive out of four sons. The opera is Verdi's eighth, from 1844, to an original text by Byron heavily adapted by librettist Piave. It is a privilege to see what a consummate singing actor can bring to this role. For the time he is on stage - less than a quarter of the opera - he holds it completely. There were some particularly fine moments on the first night. In his Act 1 duet with daughter-in-law Lucrezia (Maria Agresta) he was flinching, recoiling, letting his movements do the talking as she berated him for his failure to assert justice. The moment, later on, when Francesco Foscari cradled his son -Jacopo in his arms in the duet ""Nel tuo paterno amplesso"" was very touching indeed, as was the final scene in which Francesco Foscari is forced to resign as Doge, and then dies.The two other principals turned in strong performances too, particularly Genovese tenor Francesco Meli as Jacopo (pictured right) with a glorious, heroic, authentic Italianate tenor sound, and strong stage presence. Lucrezia, sung by Maria Agresta (pictured below), has a tricky role, butting in to the action to protest that something needs to be done, and never getting her way. She was at her best in the quieter moments, when her melismas flowed naturally and quiter beautifully. Her louder passages sometimes sounded forced, pitch got variable, but that could easily have been first night nerves.In the pit, Antonio Pappano made the case for the score right from the very first notes, with snarling, evil brass sounds. His tempi and his rubato in Verdi always seem to breathe completely naturally. The number of ways that the lower strings and bassooons give rhythmic impulse by pushing a broad first beat, giving wonderful support to the singers is a magical thing. Principal clarinet John Payne was the pick of the solo players.But it is also in the score where the problems begin. It has its moments, but also its longueurs. Whereas in later Verdi, the music invariably underpins every flickering emotion and deepens the action, in Foscari there always seems to be an incongruous tum-ti-tum allegro, defying the unremittingly bleak drama, lurking somewhere just a few bars away. And then there is the fact that the situation of the three principals scarcely changes. In one bizarre sequence in the third act, plot elements are coming in thick and fast. The news arrives that Jacopo can be irrefutably proved to be innocent. The bringer of that update exits, and another immediately enters - to say he has died anyway. Yes, stuff happens, but Foscari is an opera where the condition the characters find themselves becomes their essence. They are trapped, and remain so. An opera featuring a prisoner deep underground prompts involuntary memories of Fidelio or Salome, operas in which the plots and the scores have the kind of ineluctable forward momentum almost completely absent from Foscari.The production, by American Thaddeus Strassberger, with costumes by Mattie Ullrich and stage design by Kevin Knight, setting the action in the historical period of the 15th century, does try to explain the situation, for example by placing explanatory text on a screen in front of the stage. It worked well with words from Byron at the end: ""Ye have no right to reproach my length of days, since every hour has been the country's"", but I found it an irritant during the Overture. There is also a desire to deal with the bleakness of the plot by attempts to distract and divert, most notably with a carnival and fire-eaters. Did such episodes keep up the energy level? Not really.Foscari is a tricky piece to bring off, and this production does not make a particularly strong case for it. Nevertheless Domingo - the raison d'etre for it being staged - seems to be anything but a spent force. After medical scares in 2010 and 2013,is he slowing down? Far from it. This won't be his last role in London this season: he'll be back at Covent Garden, a fixture in his life since 1971, as Giorgio Germont in La traviata. He is also in the process of adding a further three baritone roles to his repertoire: Macbeth (Berlin), Don Carlo in Ernani (The Met) and Gianni Schicchi (Madrid).Next page: watch Domingo in conversation about Verdi at the Royal Opera before the premiereDomingo interviewed about I Due Foscari",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/i-due-foscari-royal-opera,3
379,"The Trial, Music Theatre Wales, Linbury Studio Theatre",The Trial,Music Theatre Wales,2014-10-12,alexandra Coghlan,"According to the programme essay, Philip Glass describes his latest opera as “serious, but also hilariously funny”. All I can say is, if The Trial is his idea of thigh-slapping hilarity then never, ever let him pick the movie on a night out. Whether the humour’s failure to translate lies with score or production is hard to tell at a premiere, but my money lies with the former.Philip Glass’s music can do many things: it can mesmerise and evolve, bully you into submission and seduce with its quietly shifting shapes, and it has a particularly nice line in ominous tension, as we saw in the composer’s previous Kafka-setting, In the Penal Colony. But comedy? Even the dark ironies and absurdities of this tale – hardly laugh-out-loud in the original – seem beyond the reach of Glass’s one-arpeggio-fits-all style. But senseless juxtapositions and illogical discontinuities? Those find a natural musical echo.There are some positives. Chuntering rhythms so beloved by Glass paint a bleakly mechanistic dystopia, clattering inexorably onwards even as the human debris of Josef K falls under their wheels. It’s a neat stylistic fit, and Glass does expand his musical language to find new, Weill-inspired Weimar colours in his orchestration (efficiently dispatched by the Music Theatre Wales ensemble). The effect is deliciously grotesque, heightened by Michael McCarthy’s stylized and stylish direction.Characters are exaggerated, stretched from naturalistic beginnings into their uncanny doubles – familiar, but not quite normal. Clad in monochromes, their faces pop with the primary-coloured emotions of marionettes, and the double – occasionally even triple – casting adds a strange discomfort to this world of unsettling echoes and repetitions, as the same figures return again and again in different guises to torment Josef.At the centre of the madness is Johnny Herford’s Josef K (pictured right with Paul Curievici). His is a lovely, flexible baritone, and though Glass’s lines gives him little opportunity to get his teeth into anything sustained, the voice still finds enough personality, enough humanity, to persuade us to invest in this luckless everyman.He is supported by a fine cast, including Amanda Forbes (Fraülein Bürstner/Leni), who supplies some of most nearly-comic moments of the evening, seducing with an instinctive and earthy vacuity that quite disarms the young bank manager. Paul Curievici finds the same manic intensity to painter Titorelli that he brought to John Worthing in Gerald Barry’s The Importance of Being Earnest, and Michael Bennett and Nicholas Folwell (pictured below) make a fine double-act as luckless guards Franz and Willem.So much of the energy, the charm even, of Kafka’s original is in wry tone of the authorial commentary. To translate it for stage then is to sacrifice character for drama – a trade that doesn’t altogether add up. Christopher Hampton’s libretto is serviceable, if occasionally a little wordy. Glass sets language no more idiomatically than usual, and the result is phrases and melodies that tussle at cross-purposes, distracting from the bladed precision of Kafka’s story. Fortunately Simon Banham’s designs keep things as elegantly simple as we’ve come to expect from Music Theatre Wales.Two operas later, Philip Glass’s affinity for Kafka (and MTW’s affinity for Glass) are evident. But while In the Penal Colony has an unyielding musical intensity that supplements and enlarges the horror of the original, The Trial seems to lose more than it gains in operatic translation. I can imagine no finer advocates for the work than Music Theatre Wales, and if they can’t make it work then I struggle to imagine a company that can.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/trial-music-theatre-wales-linbury-studio-theatre,3
380,"Alcina, The English Concert, Bicket, Barbican Hall",Alcina,The English Concert,2014-10-11,alexandra Coghlan,"What’s the collective noun for mezzo-sopranos? A ""warble""? A ""might""? A ""trouser""? Whatever it is, it doesn’t get a lot of usage outside a choral context. Where in opera would you ever find multiple mezzos sharing a stage? Hardly anywhere. Except, that is, in contemporary castings of baroque operas.Joyce DiDonato may have been the headliner for Handel’s Alcina at the Barbican last night, but add Alice Coote and Christine Rice to the mix – both singers more than capable of dominating a stage on their own – and you have something approaching glorious excess. Combine them all in a single trio (“Non è amor, nè gelosia”) and there’s frankly no more to be said. Job done.Talk about an ensemble cast; this Alcina was starrier than the Chiltern Firehouse on a Saturday night, with sopranos Anna Christy (Morgana) and Anna Devin (Oberto), tenor Ben Johnson (Oronte) and bass Wojtech Gierlach (Melisso) rounding off the personnel, all supported by Harry Bicket and the English Concert.But at the core of it all was DiDonato. Alcina is a slow grower for the titular enchantress, whose early acts are comparatively lightweight, growing into a sequence of lengthy set-piece arias that demand a full technical and dramatic armoury.It takes a lot of confidence to strip everything right back before you’ve had a chance to show it all off properly, but Act I’s “Si, son Quella” gained for every decibel and ounce of vibrato that DiDonato subtracted from it. From this early vulnerability she swelled to vengeful fury for a “Ma Quando Tornerai” in which coloratura was less embellishment and more spontaneous outpouring of bile, so organic were its convulsive floods of sound. And then there was her dress – a Steampunk ballgown, deconstructing for each new act in parallel with Alcina’s own decline, ultimately revealing a no-nonsense pair of boots beneath.As if answering critics of her recent Xerxes for ENO, Alice Coote (pictured right) saw DiDonato’s “Ombre Pallide” and raised her a “Sta nell’Ircana” of such joyous virtuosity and rhythmic impetus as to set the audience roaring – and that more than three hours into the evening. This is one tigress you really wouldn’t mess with. It was the perfect foil to her “Verdi Prati”, whose pianissimos let the folk-simple melody do its eloquent best. Coote and DiDonato are familiar collaborators, and this translated into some lovely semi-staged interactions between the sorceress and her unwilling lover.Stealing scenes with her gift for comedy, Christine Rice shone as lover-turned-knight Bradamante – the very definition of luxury casting in the small role with its handful of fine arias, and with even less to do Anna Devin also held her own, relishing the ferocious reproaches of “Barbara!”.If ever there was a soprano made for the silvery sheen of Morgana’s music it’s Anna Christy (pictured left). After a careful start, her voice began to spin, allowing its high overtones to gild her intricate coloratura passages and add a halo to a “Credete al mio Dolor” almost too beautiful, too sincere for such a flighty character. Both she and DiDonato benefitted from some exquisite obbligatos from cellist Joseph Crouch – arias as expressive as anything sung during the evening.Only Ben Johnson disappointed, missing the lyrical ballad hidden under the dotted dance rhythms of “Un momento di Contento” in his rush – his light tenor still feeling out of its depth in this large space.There may have been audience laughter at any mention of Alcina’s “monsters”, but there was no doubting the magic of this performance. When the vocal drama is this vivid, playing as rhetorical and precisely shaded as the English Concert, staging becomes all but irrelevant. Though if any house does finally manage to persuade DiDonato to take the role in a fully-staged production, I’ll be first in line for tickets….",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/alcina-english-concert-bicket-barbican-hall,5
381,"La Traviata, Glyndebourne Tour",La Traviata,Glyndebourne Tour,2014-10-05,Matthew Wright,"Usually, anyone bringing tuberculosis and transgression to the regional centres of Woking, Norwich and Milton Keynes would meet redoubtable opposition. In the case of Glyndebourne’s new touring production of La traviata, that would be a shame, because this is a lean, powerful version that reaches straight for the heart and gives it a good squeeze. In Russian soprano Irina Dubrovskaya and American tenor Zach Borichevsky, Glyndebourne has found very convincing replacements for the acclaimed Festival performers Venera Gimadieva and Michael Fabiano, who enact director Tom Cairns’ vision of psychological realism with great conviction.  This version places the psychology of the central couple’s relationship at its heart. From the first, the stage acting is closely observed, with effective gestures throughout, such as Violetta’s refilling of Alfredo’s champagne glass just before his toast to love. Alfredo’s no chest-beating macho, but a nervous and slightly gauche young man on the brink of self-discovery, and the gangling Borichevsky captures his faltering journey well. That vulnerability seems to be the attraction for Violetta, who, finally looking for love rather than an employer for her courtesanship, has tired of the likes of Baron Douphol.In a rather brilliant re-focusing of Violetta’s character, director Tom Cairns seems to see her tragedy as psychological. There was, tellingly, very little of the consumptive coughing traditional in the role: from Act One, where she’s unsure of his love, to Act Two, when she is easily deterred by Alfredo’s father, Giorgio Germont, and wonders aloud whether, as a courtesan, she can deserve or achieve real love, it’s a crisis of confidence as much as anything. When, at the end of Act Two, Violetta tells Alfredo he can’t understand her love, the accusing eyes of the party upon her, she seems more likely to be high, drunk, or depressed than dying of tuberculosis. Being trapped in the skin of a courtesan seems to be what kills her.Both leads needed 15 minutes to warm to their roles, until which there was a brittle, metallic edge to their voices. They shared a light, lyrical quickness, well adapted for the many scenes of dialogue. Neither (yet) has the power to fill the hall, or send 240 volts down the spine, but they were appropriately matched to characters defined by anxiety and struggle, and by the end, Dubrovskaya in particular was sounding very fine. The Glyndebourne Touring Orchestra under David Afkham accompanied sensitively. What their sound occasionally lacked in lustre it made up for in the sprung vigour of the bustling party scenes, where tension is powerfully evoked by the contrast between the fine lines of the upper, and gutsy pulse of the lower strings.Alfredo’s father, Giorgio Germont, is a more complex figure than the pompous, paternal buffoon of operatic stereotype. Quick to realise Violetta’s sensitivity and to regret his own interference, his rather woolly depiction here, by Roman Burdenko (pictured right with Zach Borichevsky), had more stuffing than shirt about it, a feature unfortunately symbolised by the failure of the glue on his false moustache. It was hard to believe that even a demoralised Violetta would find this figure, trailing strands of moustache from his pallid chops, at all imposing.  The period-lite set was for me the production’s weakest feature, though you can see what they’re getting at. Act One’s two huge curved screens, one red and one blue, aspire to suggest the drama’s public-private, Alfredo-Violetta dichotomies, though they have an unhelpful, Travelodge blandness, and the red-blue colour scheme does tend to make one fear that at any moment Dave and Ed will burst onto the stage, bandying tax cuts. Act Two was, if anything, worse, with only a backdrop – a kind of blurry, Monet-shopping-bag floral wash – to suggest the rustic intimacy of the couple’s retreat. Act Three worked best, the poignantly diminutive chandelier over Violetta’s bed suggestive of her fall from splendour. Costumes are, for the most part, non-committal rather than hugely evocative, though Violetta’s combination of elegant silvery dress – a silver that changes so easily to a leaden corpse’s pallor -– and scarlet courtesan’s gown seemed cleverly symbolic of her split identity.Each act began with Violetta lying on her bed, lit in a silvery, spectral moon-wash. It’s an evocative touch, which mirrors the yearning string theme repeated from the overture onwards. By the moment of Violetta’s final collapse, there’s almost, dare one say it, a touch of liebestod about the way she's only free to love in death.   This is a refreshing production, which dispenses with fusty moralising and tired critiques of a bourgeois morality that is difficult to make real for today’s audiences. As the curtain comes down on Violetta’s corpse, still lit in ghostly white, but now centre stage, we understand Violetta’s ultimately fatal struggle to have been that which we find at the heart of most great drama, to be yourself.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-traviata-glyndebourne-tour,4
382,"The Coronation of Poppea, Opera North",The Coronation of Poppea,Opera North,2014-10-05,graham Rickson,"Tim Albery’s production of Monteverdi’s The Coronation of Poppea takes plenty of liberties. There are moments when you scratch your head, quietly sigh, and think about your interval drink, or what you’ll eat when you get home.The cuts may disorientate Monteverdi affecionados. There’s also a bit of reordering, and no proper coronation. Albery’s new translation contains some excruciating couplets: Poppea is rhymed with ""betray her"" at one point, and later on there’s the pairing of strumpet and crumpet. Cupid is matched with stupid. Niggles aside, this is a wonderfully fresh, accessible staging of an opera which was first performed 371 years ago. How much of it was actually composed by Monteverdi is debatable, and surviving versions of the score don’t tell us what instruments should perform it. Laurence Cummings’ performing version is impeccably realised, his two small groups placed stage right and left, each led by harpsichord continuo. A pair of theorbos weave their magic, underscored by gamba and lirone.We’re in a non-specific, late 20th-century setting. Womens’ hairstyles suggest the 1960s, though the details aren’t always consistent. Bare bricks and a long table suggest a chic restaurant at one point, and there’s a refrigerator door built into the back wall. There’s a lot of red sloshing about – wine and bloody marys are consumed in large quantities, and a jug of tomato juice features prominently. Sandra Piques Eddy’s Poppea is never more alluring than when she’s clad in scarlet in Act Three (pictured right, with Laing), standing out among an improbably photogenic young cast. Counter tenor James Laing’s Nerone is typical – blond, virile and athletic, prancing around the stage with limitless energy. The voice is terrific, coping brilliantly with Monteverdi’s cruel demands, and there’s an alarmingly funny moment where he has a petulant hissy fit. It’s easy to imagine the power he exerts over his shifty guards Liberto and Lucano (Daniel Norman and Nicholas Sharratt). They behave like a couple of plain clothes police officers, notably when interrogating Katharine Manley’s Drusilla in the final act. James Creswell’s heavy-footed Seneca steals the show’s first half – a crusty buffer dressed in corduroy and tweeds, his plodding, diatonic vocal lines in stark contrast to Nerone’s acrobatics. Seneca’s foppish acolytes are a comically entertaining bunch, looking as if they’ve strayed off the set of a Wes Anderson film. Albery's supporting cast are uniformly excellent: Catherine Hopper's Ottavia and Fiona Kimm's Arnalta particularly impressive.Ottone is nicely played by Christopher Ainsley. The voice lacks the sharpness and clarity of Laing’s, but he’s another brilliant physical performer. His attempted murder of Poppea falls flat however; ludicrous cross-dressing turning the scene into cheap, corny farce. Having Emilie Renard’s Cupid portrayed as a flighty teenager in a baseball cap is effective; at one stage the three Gods watch the action while scoffing popcorn in cinema seats. The extent to which Albery’s free-wheeling exuberance trivialises the piece is debatable, but this witty, fast-moving production is easy to follow and offers plenty of visual and vocal pleasures. A shame there’s no coronation scene as such; we’re left instead with Emperor and Empress writhing on a table top as “Pur ti miro” unfolds ecstatically.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/coronation-poppea-opera-north,4
383,"L'Incoronazione di Poppea, The Academy of Ancient Music, Howarth, Barbican Hall",L'Incoronazione di Poppea,The Academy of Ancient Music,2014-10-05,alexandra Coghlan,"Monteverdi’s L’Incoronazione di Poppea is an opera with a one-track mind. The music throbs and pulses with dancing desire, suspensions and elaborate embellishments defer gratification, while recitative is poised constantly on the edge of melodic climax. Desire is everywhere, from the innocent flirtations of a young courtier and his lady, to the hopeless love of Ottone and of course the knowing, mature passions of the Emperor Nerone and his mistress Poppea. Without it, there’s a void at the core of the opera – a void no amount of fine singing or playing can fill.And try the Academy of Ancient Music certainly did last night at the Barbican. It’s tough to lose any cast-member late in the day, and to lose Anna Caterina Antonacci as Poppea is a particularly serious blow. But it really needn’t have been fatal.At nearly 60, Lynne Dawson has had a tremendously successful career and now spends more time teaching students at the Royal Northern College of Music than singing herself. Not an obvious choice, then, for the youthful and virtuosic Poppea. Did the AAM feel like they needed a “name” to replace Antonacci? Surely it would have been better (and terribly English) to give the opportunity to one of the hordes of talented up-and-coming sopranos. It’s not like a cast that also included Sarah Connolly, Iestyn Davies and Matthew Rose was ever going to be lightweight.As it was, Dawson (pictured right) limped through the role vocally, never quite finding a gear. Intonation was wayward, tone lacking in body and phrase endings abandoned like so many loose threads on a hem. But more troubling than all of this was the lack of spark between her and Sarah Connolly’s magnificent, masculine Nerone. The libretto speaks again and again of Poppea’s fire, but what should have been burning was decidedly tepid, leaving Connolly and Elmar Gilbersson’s Lucano to steal the show with a love duet in Poppea’s praise whose vocal exertions were almost as X-rated as its actions.Leaving Poppea aside (as far as that is possible in this opera) this was a joy of an evening. Taking the semi out of semi-staged, directors Alexander Oliver and Timothy Nelson went to town with costumes, the Barbican’s flexible stage space and lighting rig, conjuring a vivid and utterly engaging spectacle that lacked little for not taking place in an opera house. The Barbican’s steep back steps made a natural focal point – a sort of snakes and ladders board for this drama of power and social mobility.Commanding it all was Connolly, athletic and utterly sure in Nero’s flightiest moments of coloratura. Her tyrant was all the more terrifying for not having that seam of weakness we so often see – a calculating, rational bully who sent Matthew Rose’s thundering Seneca (sung as lightly as his manner was deliciously ponderous) to his death with brisk efficiency.There’s no getting past the cringing weakness of Ottone, but sung by Iestyn Davies (pictured left) he had a vocal gloss to compensate for any dramatic indignity, and some of the evening’s highlights were in the vocal interplay between Davies and Sophie Junker’s sweetly impetuous Drusilla. If anyone was expecting a character-tenor, Andrew Tortise’s Arnalta may have come as a shock, but it was a joy to hear the nurse’s lovely lullaby sung so delicately, and comedy found its place too in the final scene. Mention should also be made of young tenor Gwilym Bowen (Valletta/First Soldier) whose easy delivery and range make him one to watch.Underpinning it all were the delicate tempo-relations and foot-stamping attack of the AAM, directed from the harpsichord by Robert Howarth. Placing the band in the centre of the stage helped draw attention to the intimacy that exists here between instruments and voices, allowing a visual as well as dramatic interplay that worked very well.This was a wonderful performance that could have been exceptional. It’s a distinction that sounds like splitting hairs, but - as in all sexual encounters - to come this close and leave unsatisfied is hard to forgive.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/lincoronazione-di-poppea-academy-ancient-music-howarth-barbican-hall,4
384,"Moses in Egypt, Welsh National Opera",Moses in Egypt,Welsh National Opera,2014-10-04,stephen Walsh,"So easily parcelled up as a master of opera buffa, Rossini is a composer who constantly surprises by the emotional and intellectual range of his best work. William Tell, which opened WNO’s current season three weeks ago, is a major progenitor of Verdi, even arguably Wagner: grand opera devoid of what Wagner himself called effects without causes. Now the company has added the much earlier Moses in Egypt, very much not buffa, but not strictly grand either, more like oratorio by a composer whose theatrical instincts were so strong that everything he wrote ended up as opera.This is of course an exaggeration. Moses, in the original Italian version done in Cardiff, is as much about misplaced, interracial love (a theme also of Tell, as well as of Verdi’s Nabucco and most famously Aida) as it is about God and the plagues of Egypt, and it has an array of bravura arias and duets to prove it. But it also has a constant flow of choruses, and even arias with chorus, almost like the dialogue arias in Bach’s passions. And while the style flickers back and forth between the earnest biblical intensity of Moses and the Hebrews on the one hand, and the pure Italian coloratura of the illicit lovers, Osiride (the Egyptian heir apparent) and the Hebrew girl Elcia, on the other, the quality hardly slackens at any point.Quite simply, in terms of sheer invention and the technical wizardry to support it, Rossini in this form stands head and shoulders above any other Italian opera composer before Verdi. There are thrilling, unforgettable moments: the first act duet for Osiride and Elcia, with distant trumpets telling her that the Hebrews are leaving so she must too – a piece Bizet surely had in mind in Carmen’s castanet song with the trumpet retreat; Amaltea’s wonderful aria with chorus in Act 2; the exquisite quartet with harp later that act. But even the more conventional pieces are somehow better, more striking than one expects. One is continually caught off guard: a surprising, exhilarating experience.WNO do the work proud. David Pountney’s and designer Raimund Bauer’s staging – though, as with the apple in William Tell, it fudges the most sensational effect: the parting of the Red Sea – is beautifully devised in general as a visual correlative of the basic elements of the plot. Famously, the curtain goes up on total darkness (the first plague), but as light returns the colours slowly emerge in blue-green fatigues for the Hebrews, red and orange for the Egyptians, divided left and right, like the Sharks and Jets in West Side Story, but modern dress only up to a point, with antique nuances: Moses in a long white robe, Pharoah with headdress. All is finely harmonized, with costumes by Marie-Jeanne Lecca and lighting by Fabrice Kebour.The stage direction is also superb; the characters really move to the music, which means they move a good deal and well. This is choreography without choreographer, movement as emotion, stillness as authority. Gradually the colours flow into one another as the passions begin to confuse the racial stereotypes. I’m not sure I swallow Pountney’s final curtain, where the sea disgorges its prey, and all, Hebrews and Egyptians, embrace – an idea neither biblical, Rossinian nor, alas, modern. But it’s true that the composer’s dispatching of Pharoah’s men is a bit perfunctory, and does seem to leave something unsaid.Before that, however, the tensions produce a string of memorable performances. Claire Booth’s Elcia (pictured right with David Alegret) is outstanding, vocally warm and secure, a portrait of emotional agony with shades of Mozart’s Elektra, but in a way more touching because more human. Admittedly it’s not easy to share her affection for David Alegret’s unsmiling, somewhat one-dimensional Osiride, though he handles the vocal bravura well. More interesting – only partly because Rossini makes her so – is Christine Rice’s Amaltea, Pharoah’s wife but a Hebrew sympathiser. Her brilliant “La pace mia smarrita” with chorus was a high point of the opening night.Pharoah himself, torn between realpolitik and intermittent plagues, is a convincing, well-rounded portrait by Andrew Foster-Williams. Would that his modern equivalents had a sorcerer or two to bring them to heel. Here Nicky Spence (Mambre) performs the task ably, short of actual sorcery, which is left to Moses himself, starting with darkness, proceeding to hailstones, then finally (remember the Cambridge Circus weather forecast: “coming in from the north-north west”) death of all the first-born. Rossini resists the temptation to turn the founder of Jewish law into a coloratura bass, and instead depicts him like Jesus before Pilate, dignified, unmoveable, above the common rush of semiquavers. Miklós Sebestyén is superb in the role, while the semiquavers are mainly delegated to his brother, Aaron, the excellent Barry Banks.Carlo Rizzi is again in charge (on the night Lothar Koenigs announced his departure from WNO next year), and as ever draws brilliant playing from the orchestra, in a score rich in wind solos and powerful brass-writing. The chorus meanwhile maintain their reputation as simply the best: refined, powerful and intelligent. Alexander Martin, their chorus master, took the first bow, and rightly so.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/moses-egypt-welsh-national-opera,5
385,"The Girl of the Golden West, English National Opera",The Girl of the Golden West,English National Opera,2014-10-03,David Nice,"So now it’s Minnie Get Your Gun from the director who brought us the gobsmackingly inventive Young Vic Annie (as in sharpshooter Oakley, not Little Orphan). Richard Jones’s subversive but still very human take on Irving Berlin discombobulated its American support and never made Broadway; but there’s little here that would rock the steadily progressive Met (home of La fanciulla del West’s 1910 premiere, with Enrico Caruso as “Dick Johnson” aka quickly repentant bandit Ramerrez). Girl should certainly go well in Santa Fe, sharing this production with ENO.Jones knows better in his maturity than to throw out much of Puccini’s meticulous realistic background to a romantic, even idealistic melodrama; unlike his Annie, but very like his Welsh National Opera Mastersingers, coming to ENO in the spring, there's more than usual fidelity to time and place.  For all the usual pared-down focus of regular Jones collaborator Miriam Buether’s trademark sets and consummate, if this time unobtrusive lighting by Mimi Jordan Sherin, the locale is most helped by Kelly Rourke’s free translation of a rather good libretto by one Zangarini, itself a fairly faithful rendering of David Belasco’s Wild West play. That means accents to match, excellent from our heroine, needing some toning-down from some of the comprimario roles (Leigh Melrose's Sonora, for one, though he sings as well as ever).It’s mostly a man’s world, the Californian mountain misery of homesick miners, with pre-echoes of Janáček’s From the House of the Dead and even Britten’s Billy Budd. But two women hold the trump cards: on stage, the Minnie of Susan Bullock, our most successful Wagnerian soprano export as an in-demand Brünnhilde around the world, playing no-nonsense, golden-hearted Minnie of the Polka Saloon, and in the pit Canadian conductor Keri-Lynn Wilson, who hurls us into Puccini’s whole-tone vortex and takes us by surprise as the lights rapidly dim. Her approach mixes full-bloodedness with pointillist-flecked lyricism very well; only in the second-act crux could I have done with a bit more spring-heeled pace.This is perhaps the composer’s most elaborately orchestrated and most symphonic score, Debussyan subtlety and Wagnerian oceanic force rolled into one; it relies less on one sweeping melody after another – though several do carry us along - than on the mining of short, malleable motifs. But what Wilson, Jones and the men of the ENO Chorus along with the whole host of smaller parts – ranging from the clarion veteran Graham Clark as bartender Nick (pictured above on the left with Craig Colclough's Rance and Jonathan McGovern's Sid) to young lyric tenor Sam Furness’s voice gleaming occasionally through the textures - make us most aware of within minutes is the dramatic fluctuation between masculine violence and feminine yearning. Perhaps the fact that this is Puccini’s own essential make-up is what grips us so much when nothing is happening other than elaborate set-up.The boys miss their mamas and their pets back home to a wonderful American folksong which Puccini, yielding his usual compositional autonomy, leans on throughout (now, thanks to the supertitles, I’m no longer wondering what ""The Old Dog Tray"", the title of the song, might mean – our minstrel, George Humphries as a blind, omnipresent Jake Wallace, is singing about the old dog, Tray). But then they’re just as ready to lynch one of their crew for cheating at cards, a situation which will come back to haunt our upright heroine when she dares all for love.Jones is more subtly stylized than usual in switching the stage mood from still sadness to violent flare-ups. Sure, these guys are sentimental, and so is their beloved Minnie in preaching love and redemption. But she has a convincing reason in one of those many not-quite arias which give us backstory – in this case an always-in-love ma and pa to make her yearn for something good. Sheriff Jack Rance won’t provide it, since he listens only to money; the fugitive bandit passing himself off as newcomer Dick Johnson of Sacramento (Peter Auty, pictured above in Act Two) clearly will, for all his dissembling. Jones beautifully underlines what draws these two together; Bullock and Peter Auty are deeply impressive in their quiet, hopeful moments.The melodrama piles on potential hokum in a second act which takes its blueprint from the Tosca-Cavaradossi-Scarpia triangle (though it starts piquantly with an understated colloquy between Clare Presland and Jimmy Holiday as the two Native Americans in the opera). Craig Colclough is no overpowering Verdi/Puccini baritone, rather a bass-baritone paradoxically most impressive in his upper register, but that helps keep his Sheriff human. The poker game he plays with Minnie for Ramerrez’s life, divided double-basses thrumming with almost unbearable tension, ends in what’s presented here as a deliberate anti-climax; Minnie cheats and wins, it’s all over in a second.Rance’s drunken alienation in Act Three is convincing, too (Colclough pictured right with Nicholas Masters' Ashby), and the lynch-mob chorus, taking place not in the expected big country but all in lines outside the sheriff’s office, duly terrifies, with Lucy Burge's choreography having the men break out into a scary stomp. Auty rises to impressive heroic heights and pulls off the opera’s one hit aria, Bullock hits all the top Cs she needs to even if it’s not always a beautiful sound; neither voice is exactly Italianate or lush, but like Colclough, these lovers ultimately tell the truth and we believe in their right to happiness.Jones’s coup, a simpler parallel to the separating of the mafia family rooms in his recent Rodelinda, comes at the end; it’s not exactly a ride off into the sunset, nor any drastic alternative, but a stage picture that reflects in its own special way the glowing twilight embers, sadness even, of the epilogue. Quietly impressive, grounded in real human emotions despite a plot that’s often preposterous, this production is as nuanced as Jones’s more outlandish creations, and if in the end we love and respect Puccini the more, that’s a job well done by all concerned.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/girl-golden-west-english-national-opera,4
386,"Piau, Les Paladins, Correas, Wigmore Hall",Piau,Les Paladins,2014-10-02,alexandra Coghlan,"2014 is the 250th anniversary of the death of Jean-Philippe Rameau, France’s baroque giant and maverick. To say that the UK celebrations have been muted is to put in generously, reconfirming a national trend that has long sidelined this repertoire in favour of more familiar Italian and German contemporaries. So it was especially good to see the Wigmore Hall full for an anniversary concert from instrumental ensemble Les Paladins and soprano Sandrine Piau.But, emerging back out onto Wigmore Street after barely more than an hour of performance, I found myself baffled. Was this brief evening of musical bonbons designed to avoid scaring people? If so, then it will certainly have succeeded – there was nothing in the melodious arias and dance interludes to frighten even the most reactionary Handelian. Was it intended to be a spontaneous and off-the-cuff sort of affair, eschewing a heavy programme in favour of the musical equivalent of a Gallic shrug of  je ne sais quoi? If so, then the unnecessary and protracted bouts of tuning and pauses for applause between every three-minute number may have sabotaged the lightness somewhat.What there was of the concert was very good indeed, making it all the harder to accept this timid tribute in place of what might have been. Piau is unbeatable, the absolute best, in this repertoire, taking unyielding architectural phrases and melting them into implausible melodies, shading each note with absolute precision of both tone and emotion. In a series of amuse-bouche arias she gave us poised despair (""Tristes apprêts"", from Castor et Pollux), coloratura brilliance (""Brillez, astres nouveaux"", also from Castor) and all-out musical farce, complete with harp-playing and spoken dialogue (""Formons les plus brillants"" from Platée). Les Paladins’ ""Je vole, amour"" gave us perhaps the best chance to appreciate this small, supple voice, embellishing lines in glorious competition with the flute, and shocking with sudden simplicity and sweetness.It’s unusual to see a group of this size conducted, but Jérôme Correas kept things energised and idiomatic, if occasionally favouring some rather polite tempos. Dances from  Les Surprises de l’Amour climaxed in a riotous tambourin and throwaway contredanse, bright with piccolos and sardonic bassoon, while the opener – the Overture from Les Indes Galantes – had a subversive swing concealed underneath its genteel formality.Addressing the audience briefly, Correas (pictured right) proved himself articulate and funny. How much more satisfying would it have been to have blended concert and lecture, to have had this engaging expert take us through a bit of biography and history, giving a context pieces that only come into their own with a little musical and dramatic background, rather than a short evening of inscrutable morsels. Failing that, I’d have settled for just a little more continuity of programming – a dramatic arc of number stitched together into some kind of narrative – to avoid the nervy stop-start rhythms of applause after every 3-minute piece.According to Les Arts Florissants’ William Christie, Glyndebourne has no plans to return to French baroque opera any time soon. It’s a blow, particularly this year, and one that seems sadly representative of a wider attitude. What a shame then that this opportunity for some gentle musical evangelism wasn’t taken up with just a little more imagination. As a concert, this was entertaining and enjoyable; as a 250th anniversary tribute to one of baroque’s great revolutionaries, it was lacking.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/piau-les-paladins-correas-wigmore-hall,3

388,"Carmen, Mid Wales Opera",Carmen,Mid Wales Opera,2014-09-26,stephen Walsh,"It’s only a few days since I was remarking, à propos the WNO revival, that Carmen usually survives its interpreters. Now WNO’s humble neighbour, Mid Wales Opera, are proving the same point, but in a more positive spirit, by touring a new production by Jonathan Miller, with a vastly reduced orchestra, a cast of fourteen including chorus, and a set (Nicky Shaw) made up of moveable stagings cleverly lit (by Declan Randall), like some highly simplified Chirico. Once again, Bizet comes through, not exactly enhanced, not always idiomatic, but as enjoyable as ever.The unexpected heroes of the show, as seen and heard in Tewkesbury’s Roses Theatre on Thursday, are the ten-piece band under MWO’s musical director, Nicholas Cleobury, playing the score in an extremely skilful reduction by Stephen McNeff. In the old Carl Rosa days a touring production on this scale would have had piano accompaniment, take it or leave it. But these reduced orchestrations are a very different matter if sensitively done, presenting the music in sketch form perhaps, but with plenty of colour and a kind of sonic vitality that is sometimes absent even from full orchestral performances.One can get endless pleasure following this novel yet expert ensemble through Bizet’s wonderful musicMcNeff’s band is well chosen: a solo trumpet brandishes the opening melody, a solo cello picks out the fate theme, an alto saxophone adds sensual warmth to the middle registers, a guitarist plucks away like some Andalusian harp. One can get endless pleasure just following this novel yet expert ensemble through Bizet’s wonderful music. And what a relief to hear it conducted with such precision and flexibility after the Cardiff shemozzle! Only briefly in the final act did the lack of real body to the sound restrict the drama to any serious extent. Up to this point the texture and movement were fully equal to the stage narrative.Miller’s production (sung in a free English translation by Rory Bremner) is basic and a shade too aware of the limited space in the small-town theatres and cinemas through which the company will thread its way from now until mid-November. For some reason he updates the setting to the 1940s, a drab and ugly time for fashion, in a work that should flaunt costume and colour. And there is little or no sense of southern Spain, no heat, no frenzy, none of that emotional violence that destroys the pure Navarrais in Don José. The movement and choreography are tepid, the fight in Act 3 almost imperceptible. But then Miller’s Carmen, Helen Sherman, is so blond and light-skinned that when the dark, bearded José (Leonel Pinheiro) accuses her of being a gypsy it’s as if the whole production has come out in negative.The best things in it are intelligent touches in the directing of individual numbers: the card-reading trio (with Daisy Brown and Marta Fontanals-Simmons touchingly bemused by Sherman’s intensity), the toreador’s song, the smugglers’ quintet. But there are musical strengths as well. Sherman herself may not be one of Nature’s Carmens to look at, but she sings the part beautifully, with fine dark colourings in the chest register and plenty of brilliance on top. As Micaëla, Elin Pritchard has to weather an unsuitable gingham frock and bobby socks, sounds inhibited and girlish in Act 1, but blossoms in her big aria, allowing the warmth to flow out. Pinheiro, by contrast, often sounds tight and compressed, which is all right for the character but less so for the music. Nicholas Lester (pictured above right) is a fine, personable Escamillo who knows how to move and how to stand, like any self-respecting toreador.Cuts are made that one regrets but can understand. Since little boys can’t be toured in school term, their guard-changing chorus goes missing, as – for less obvious reasons – does the Act 2 entr’acte. The dialogue is reduced to a minimum, no great loss, and it shortens the evening manageably for remote areas where footpads still roam the lanes at night and owls turn into witches.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/carmen-mid-wales-opera,3
389,"Carmen, Welsh National Opera",Carmen,Welsh National Opera,2014-09-20,stephen Walsh,"Popularity is all very well, but it can be a poisoned chalice. Braving the umpteenth revival of Carmen at WNO (original directors Patrice Caurier and Moshe Leiser, revival director Caroline Chaney), I began to experience that sense of weariness that sometimes afflicts the dutiful end of the repertoire: Bizet’s masterpiece along with the relentless Butterflies and Toscas, the Figaros and Barbers. That feeling that the work and its myriad devotees will somehow get us through in the absence of anything resembling artistic necessity. And indeed Friday’s audience played its part, clapping at every possible and a few impossible moments, appreciating everything, noticing nothing. I thought of Schnabel; they even clap when it’s good.Good this mostly wasn’t. Let’s start with conductor Erik Nielsen. He set off at a clip and a half, and generally maintained it, often in defiance of the singers’ needs or (more to the point) awareness. Ensemble was often shaky and now and then atrocious. Orchestral balance took its chance, though these players are so good that the music usually came through anyway. And what music it is! Bizet’s death aged 37 soon after the premiere of this marvellous work must count as the biggest single tragedy for opera, greater even than Mozart’s early death or Shostakovich’s retreat after Lady Macbeth. Carmen usually deserves better of its interpreters; but it also usually survives them.Here it survives some questionable casting. Alessandra Volpe (pictured right with Peter Wedd) has the looks and vocal type of a good Carmen, but on this evidence she lacks the depth of sound and the sheer presence of the gypsy soul. In her final scene with José, she is like a schoolgirl head-butting an annoying boyfriend. The nobility of the moment escapes her. And she sometimes sings flat. But then Peter Wedd is throughout a tepid Don José, unsubtle in the Flower Song, more refined in his Act 1 duet with Micaëla, but with generally execrable French. Kostas Smoriginas’s Escamillo has presence and poise, but not enough body in the voice. A singing bull, one feels, would brush him aside; but he would go elegantly.By far the best singing comes from Jessica Muirhead, especially stylish and charming in Micaëla’s Act 3 aria, but good also in the duet; and there is at least potentially good support from Amy Freston (Frasquita), Emma Carrington (Mercedes), Julian Boyce (Dancaïre) and Cárthaigh Quill (Remendado) – potentially, because on Friday their quintet sparkled only for as long as they and the conductor remained in the same time zone.The production totters along, in its inevitable box set, no sign of Spain until a few oranges appear in Act 4, no heat o’ the sun, no procession, so that the Carmen/Escamillo duet comes out of the blue and only the music tells us that the tragedy is being acted out against a backcloth of ceremonious death. Maybe this self-denial once brought out the power of Bizet’s drama; these days it merely bypasses it.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/carmen-welsh-national-opera,1
390,"Xerxes, English National Opera",Xerxes,English National Opera,2014-09-16,alexandra Coghlan,"Nicholas Hytner’s 1988 Magic Flute may have trilled its last at English National Opera, but judging by the wit, the joy and the energy on display last night it would be absolutely criminal to put the director’s even more elderly Xerxes out to pasture – the show that brought Handel back into fashion when it premiered in 1985.I was a little too busy being born to attend the production’s first outing, so came late to the party at its most recent outing in 2005. Revival director Michael Walling has refined his ideas since then, and there’s a lot less fuss and faff among designer David Fielding’s hyper-stylized rendering of the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens. Never has going south of the river been more exotic or more chic.Stripped of some of its excess movement, Hytner’s elegant concept speaks clearly and wittily. Here is a Handel opera seria refracted through the anarchic world of the 18th-century pleasure garden. Just as darkness and desire make for a sensuous democracy, so Hytner’s sly collisions of worlds and tones makes for a riotous commentary on the formal conventions and expectations of Handel’s day.A colourful cast of principals burst into an orderly monochrome world in which white-faced servants wait silently and grey-clad ladies and gentleman take cautious pleasure in tea and deckchairs. It’s a drama that mirrors the quiet anarchy of Handel’s own score, which cheerfully thwarts musical conventions, and weaves drama together in a strikingly fluid and contemporary arc.Set originally in ancient Persia, the plot is the usual convulsions of thwarted love, tyrannical power and righteous vengeance, with just a dash of cross-dressing. Crucially however humour plays as big a role as passion, and this seam of wit is beautifully tapped in Nicholas Hytner’s own libretto. After some startlingly poor recent efforts it’s good to be reminded just what a translation can do – its delicate wordplay and fidelity to spirit rather than substance making an unanswerable case for ENO’s embattled opera-in-English policy.At the centre of this revival is Alice Coote’s Xerxes (pictured right), a miracle of petulant, lusty privilege and swagger. Coote’s comic timing is a delight, playing off the cool disdain of Sarah Tynan’s Romilda and earnest brother Arsamenes (Andrew Watts) with gleeful enjoyment. Add to this Coote’s customary coloratura brilliance (nowhere better displayed than in “Crude furie”) and a nifty trick with some collapsing statuary, and you have a Xerxes that’s about as good as it gets.Tynan, who sang the role of Atalanta back in 2005, now takes on Romilda – an exchange that trades comic breadth of character for intensity. But even straitjacketed in the heroine’s rather thankless tragedy, Tynan finds the spark of personality that transforms a classic sisterly dispute into a Wildean comedy of manners, aided by Rhian Lois’s perfectly pitched Atalanta (pictured below with Andrew Watts as Arsamenes). Holding her own against Tynan’s superb singing, Lois once again proves her gift for comedy, as believable as she is charming.Watts’ isn’t the loveliest of countertenor voices, lacking the polish of Lawrence Zazzo or Iestyn Davies, and gets a little wild at the top. It’s certainly powerful enough for the Coliseum however, and its rather ragged athleticism makes for an unusually characterful Arsamenes – usually the bland precursor to Mozart’s tenors. Despite looking like a German pop star circa 1990, Neal Davies brings a gravitas to commander Ariodates, and mezzo Catherine Young makes an impression as a Connolly-in-the-making, her Amastris both touching and impressively sung.Pretty, witty and thoroughly tongue-in-cheek, this Xerxes is still a masterclass in bringing baroque up to date. It should be required viewing for all young opera directors, and compulsory for anyone who thinks they don’t like Handel opera.

391,"Otello, English National Opera",Otello,English National Opera,2014-09-14,alexandra Coghlan,"From one great operatic storm to another. 2014 opened at English National Opera with David Alden’s Peter Grimes, gale-tossed and wet with sea-spray, and now the director turns his attention to Verdi’s Otello. Restlessly urgent, Edward Gardner’s opening assaulted us with timpani thunderclaps, stabbing into the silent auditorium as Otello himself would do just a few hours later. Tragedy is written into the musical fabric of Verdi’s opera, and in Alden’s new production we have a pervasive emotional horror that matches it blow for blow.2014 marks Alden’s 30th year working with ENO. Anyone feeling uncharitable could suggest that, on the basis of this Otello, the director hasn’t aged an artistic day – still returning to all his favourite dramatic ticks and reflexes. But although this production has the Alden signature, it also has something of that same clarity that cut so heartbreakingly through Peter Grimes.Alden’s Cyprus is a walled stone courtyard. Occasionally a door slides away to reveal a skyline beyond, but our characters never step outside this claustrophobic no-place. Crucially it’s a public space, where the chorus cluster during the opening storm, where the Venetian delegation later stand and observe, and where eventually Otello will murder his wife. Nothing in this bleak arena is truly private.Updating the action to the 1920s casts the Desdemona-Otello conflict in the light of greater social changes, setting pervasive militarism and masculine politics against a quiet female emancipation that is still ahead of its time. This Desdemona is unwilling just to sit, smile and receive flowers, fighting subordination at every stage. Unlike Desdemona and unlike Shakespeare’s own condemned Emilia, Verdi’s handmaiden (sung here by Pamela Helen Stephen) survives to accuse her husband, a figure of hope on the threshold of a new age.Not everything here works, however. Maxine Braham’s movement direction is jarringly self-conscious; a mad woman (seemingly borrowed from Christopher Alden’s Rigoletto) rampages around to little obvious end, and there’s altogether too much chair-throwing and wall-caressing going on for dramatic conviction. But these details dissolve on contact with an exceptional cast.Making his role debut here, Stuart Skelton’s Otello (pictured above with Jonathan Summers) has more than touch of the Grimes about him. With no racial distinction made, this warrior’s otherness stems from his physicality. While others talk their conflicts he can only hurl objects or lash out in violence, caged within the social codes of a world that is not his own. Vocally he dominates, finest in moments of extremity – the mock-marriage duet with Iago, the confrontations with Desdemona – though as yet less in command of the more delicate vocal details of the psychological collapse.Leah Crocetto’s Desdemona is thrillingly assertive, both dramatically and vocally. This is a woman who won’t be silenced, who returns to plead her case no matter how many times her husband denies her. Crocetto’s vocal force re-negotiates the opera’s power dynamics. For once we’re not reading against the text, but setting Otello against his musical equal. Crocetto’s Willow Song is the mature, dramatic allegory of a woman who goes knowingly to her death, not the artful musings of a woman-child, while the Ave Maria (sung, in a final twist of the knife, to a Virgin used as a dartboard in the previous scene) is a model of simplicity and elegance.Dramatically captivating, Jonathan Summers’ lived-in Iago (pictured above with Skelton) stands apart. Far from beautiful, Summers’ singing has the roughness and bluffness we might expect of “honest Iago”, his every unphrased utterance giving the lie to his carefully crafted persona. He finds his opposite in Allan Clayton’s Cassio – gorgeously sung, every syllable (even the drunken ones) beautiful and poised.Exquisitely lit by Adam Silverman, the sombre visuals of this Otello are all a play of shadow and illumination – a subtlety and a control echoed in Alden’s psychological drama. This is a production that pierces both ear and heart.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/otello-english-national-opera,4
392,"William Tell, Welsh National Opera",William Tell,Welsh National Opera,2014-09-13,stephen Walsh,"A few months ago, while looking something up about Liszt’s piano piece “Chapelle de Guillaume Tell,” I discovered to my horror that William Tell – like Robin Hood – may never have existed. Even the apple, like the one in Genesis (there is no apple in Genesis), seems to have been made up by someone or other. Tell none the less lives on, if nowhere else, in Schiller’s play and Rossini’s opera based on it, of which everyone knows the overture and – perhaps without realizing it – some of the ballet music. But this is a long opera, even as somewhat cut in David Pountney’s new WNO production; it has a great deal in it that even many Rossini lovers don’t know. And a lot of this is very fine stuff indeed.Rossini’s serious operas are generally less well-known than his comedies, and some of them – to tell the truth – are quite dull. His Moses in Egypt, also in this WNO season (October 3), abides our question. Even William Tell has its mauvais quarts d’heure, to quote Rossini’s own joke about Wagner. But the good moments in it more than make up for the longueurs; and they turn out to have been highly influential. For instance, so famous a piece as Verdi’s “Di quella pira” in Il Trovatore is more or less a rip-off of Arnold’s Act IV cabaletta in Tell. Elsewhere one might hear early Wagner, even snatches of Berlioz and Bizet, both admirers of the work. Rossini may have been moving towards something new in music drama. But he never got there, because William Tell, composed at the age of thirty-seven, was his last opera, and in the remaining thirty-nine years of his life he never again wrote for the stage.The work’s length and generally slow pace present obstacles to a sophisticated modern staging. The choral writing, especially, is terrific, but the choral action, as such, is somewhat inert. For an opera about liberation from the oppressor, there’s a good deal of standing around and facing front, partly because Rossini dwells at length on the episodes where the Swiss folk kowtow to the Austrians; not till the end of the second act (almost two hours in) does active rebellion start, and even then it’s expressed through a series of slowish choruses for the canton representatives – a political moment rather than a battle scene.Pountney seems to accept this monumental aspect of Rossini’s dramaturgy, and there are times in his staging when one is uncomfortably reminded of the old days at Sadlers Wells where the chorus stood and delivered, occasionally slapping each other on the back or raising a beer tankard. When Tell shoots Gesler, the Austrian soldiers, stuck up on a high gantry, do nothing but look helplessly on.Amir Hosseinpour’s quirky choreography brilliantly suggests enforced festivity and ritualised abuseRaimund Bauer’s sets, backed by pivoting dun-coloured screens with vaguely montagnard projections, far from suggesting the smiling mountain scenery of Jouy’s original libretto, darken the action and turn it inwards. Movement is mainly provided by Amir Hosseinpour’s quirky choreography, brilliantly suggestive of enforced festivity and ritualised abuse. Marie-Jeanne Lecca’s vivid costumes feed a certain ambiguity in this whole approach: are we in rural medieval Switzerland or some proto-Soviet hell with the workers in grey tunics and caps? Stag-helmeted armour for the Austrians might imply antique oppression of the hunted by the hunters, or it might suggest a much more recent horror in the German lands. None of this is unreasonable. Rossini offers plenty of hunting imagery as an expression of power; his writing for valve horn – a recent invention in his day – is spectacular. But what we hear is sometimes more mobile than what we see.The opening night had problems not entirely of the director’s making. It may be partly his fault that Barry Banks, pictured right as Rossini’s Manrico-figure Arnold, is a foot or so shorter than his beloved Mathilde (Gisela Stille), and that this vision of absurdity is aggravated by Arnold’s plus-fours and fluffy hair-do. It was hardly his fault that Stille was under doctor’s orders not to sing, so was reduced to a fairly sketchy miming of the part while Camilla Roberts sang (beautifully) from the side. Fortunately, Banks also sang with fine tone and considerable bravura, so that it was just possible to ignore the geographical oddity of their duets, which are among the most brilliant things in the whole work.Tell’s music, by comparison, is largely subdued, and David Kempster, every inch the calm, dignified, peace-loving folk hero, provides an authoritative but somewhat languid presence; even when shooting the apple, he doesn’t in fact shoot, and instead the lights dim and a deus ex machina simply takes the apple off Jemmy’s head – a big disappointment for lovers of stage illusion. In fact Pountney’s most inspired idea all evening is strictly an irrelevancy: having the orchestra’s principal cello, Rosie Biss, dress up as a Victorian artiste and play her opening solo alone on the stage – a wonderful solution to the director’s nightmare dilemma of what to do during the overture.With all these reservations, it’s a good and welcome revival, well sung in the original French. The chorus is on top form, as usual, making the most of music that must often remind them of their favourite early Verdi. From a large an entirely excellent cast, I would also single out Fflur Wyn’s charmingly boyish Jemmy, and Clive Bayley’s superbly villainous and resonant Gesler, in Pountney’s trade-mark wheelchair. Luciano Botelho sings the fisherman’s opening song exquisitely: the prototype, perhaps, for Wagner’s Steuermann. Carlo Rizzi conducts, with style and energy, and the orchestra does Rossini’s score – one of his best and most consistently interesting – almost complete justice.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/william-tell-welsh-national-opera,4
393,"Façade/Eight Songs for a Mad King, Grimeborn Opera, Arcola Theatre",Façade/Eight Songs for a Mad King,Grimeborn Opera,2014-09-05,Bernard Hughes,"Walton’s Façade is not performed very often in London, but this weekend there is the opportunity to hear it four days in a row: on Monday at a chamber Prom, but before that in this enterprising staging, paired with Peter Maxwell Davies’ Eight Songs for a Mad King.The original conception of Façade was that it should be performed “in as abstract a manner as possible” but this interpretation is as specific as possible. 84 days after the end of the First World War, the patients at an asylum for those mentally scarred by the conflict gather to perform music together. The reciter’s part is shared between two actors – the hardworking Charmian Bedford (pictured below) and Danny Standing – who enact a series of miniature dramas reflecting Edith Sitwell’s intricate and fantastical verse, at times consoling each other, or flirting, teasing or confronting each other, using a range of resonant props including poppies and a gun.The music came through loud and clear – in the case of the percussion, very loud. The band of six, excellently led by the understated but authoritative Oliver Zeffman, played with the necessary wit and zing. Unfortunately, the balance between voices and instruments was calamitous; there was clearly a microphone malfunction, which made it worse, but things weren’t right even before that. So, sadly, for all the rich direction by Ella Marchment and enjoyable choreography of Joseph Toonga, the real glory of Façade – the brilliant words – was often completely lost.Façade is connected, musically speaking, with Eight Songs for a Mad King by a quality of knowingness, the using of other people’s music unabashedly in the cause of creating something new. But where Walton’s music is sophisticated and polished, Maxwell Davies creates a sound-world which is brutal and unforgiving, shining a harsh light on the mental agonies of King George III. The King, encircled by the players, interacts with each in turn, in an attempt to come to terms with the prison of his condition. Eventually, in fury, he grabs the violinist’s instrument and, in a brilliantly shocking coup de théâtre, smashes it to pieces.Eight Songs for a Mad King is a virtuosic showpiece, and its success rests almost entirely on performance of the King, sung here by Samual Pantcheff (pictured right). There was an engaging vulnerability to his interpretation of a sick person who knows something is not right with him, but can’t put his finger on what is amiss. The vocal pyrotechnics were well handled; it is an unforgiving piece, with little “straight” singing apart from the Handel quotations near the end, and extended techniques are used throughout. Pantcheff’s reading perhaps did not always plumb the depths of the King’s despair, but in his violin-smashing fury there was a genuine thrill.The balance issues of the first half were much less of a problem, largely because Maxwell Davies’s scoring is much sparer, and allows the voice to come through; it was also a help that the role is sung rather than spoken.Staging Façade, although it was not in Walton’s plans, is a perfectly reasonable thing to want to do, and the World War I setting, although a bit contrived in some particulars, largely worked. The pairing with Eight Songs was an interesting idea, and some nice directorial and design touches connected the two pieces. This was my first experience of the Grimeborn festival of new and unusual operas at Arcola, but I will make a point of returning next year.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/fa%C3%A7adeeight-songs-mad-king-grimeborn-opera-arcola-theatre,3

395,"Prom 58: Salome, Deutsche Oper Berlin, Runnicles",Prom 58: Salome,Deutsche Oper Berlin,2014-08-31,David Nice,"So here’s where I join the ranks of Old Opera Bores by declaring this Salome, Nina Stemme, the best I’ve seen since Hildegard Behrens in 1978, and this Salome as in Richard Strauss’s Wilde opera from Donald Runnicles and his Deutsche Oper Berlin ensemble categorically the most near-perfect. It’s also the first time I’ve had a group of very loud, rude people behind me shouting “sit down” when I stood at the end (and John the Baptist’s God knows I don’t do that often). To which the only answers were “stand up yourselves” and “what does it take?” Most of the arena stalls eventually followed suit, but my thinking is, if it’s a thrilling conclusion and you know it’s been as great as they come, don’t wait to see what others are going to do.But those of you who weren't in the hall will want to know what it was actually like, not least visually since this, of all Proms, isn’t to be televised. After his less-is-more semi-stagings of Wagner with minimal means last year, trumping Bayreuth for the bicentenary, Justin Way has charge of the manoeuvres in the second and third Strauss operas at the Proms in 150th anniversary year. This time, some were singing from scores on stands, which only slightly compromised Burkhard Ulrich’s Herod on the verge of a nervous breakdown – character rather than heroic tenor, but never overdoing the funny-peculiar business; somehow the buttoned-up approach and the DJs of the other score-bound men made sure that wife Herodias – Doris Soffel, the would-be prima donna with her moments in the moonlight – and stepdaughter Salome, Stemme inevitably upstaging mama, had real command of the platform. Their top notes, incidentally, were matched by a major presence in a smaller role, Ronnita Miller as the ""Page"" who warns lovestruck Narraboth (Thomas Blondelle, as lustrous as any in the only romantic-tenor role) in an opening scene which immediately announced the levels of meaningful commitment.In a plausibly fluid topography, Samuel Youn’s Jokanaan (pictured right) declaimed not in muffled tones from a cistern but in full resonant prophetic spate from the organ (later that instrument gave a creepier pedal note or two than a portable version in an opera-house pit ever could). Youn kept his distance, histrionically speaking, in repelling the teenage princess’s overheated advances, and signalled a warning crack just before his big curse which opened up alarmingly in a later declamation  – a small price to pay for such a big voice filling the hall so handsomely.A rim of moon on the LED strip at the back of the platform changed to green and later blood red, which gave us more of Oscar Wilde’s dominant, much invoked presence – Strauss sets most of the original text – than many productions. No props were needed. The cast left the stage for Salome’s Dance, Deutsche Oper soloists including supremely artistic flute, conjuring a levitational delicacy complete with feminine endings when the orientalia turns Viennese-waltzy, and Stemme addressed her ""transfiguration through love"" compellingly to thin air, conjuring up a severed head as consummately as a first-class Macbeth conjures up an invisible-to-all-others Banquo's ghost.No limitations bound Stemme’s total assumption. Slinking down from the side steps in a star-spangled black dress, she instantly invoked the spoilt adolescent, first petulant and then obsessive, with authoritative chest voice already at scary odds with both that and the diaphanous orchestral wraps. Hers is one of those rare dramatic sopranos with whom you know you can feel secure in the insane demands on the top of the range and the over-arching phrases: she knows what to do, at every point. And if in the past I think I’ve noted the seams, dramatic characterization and musical expression were absolutely as one last night.The final scene where Salome gets what she wants, the head of Jokanaan, and can't at first believe it seesawed us between pity – those rare tears did come to the eyes in Salome’s ache at what might have been – and terror at the imperiousness now exercised on a prophetic face that can’t answer back. Runnicles and his magnificently responsive orchestra similarly pursued the schizoid in Strauss’s ever-breathtaking score – one moment Lehár operetta, the next Schoenbergian atonal expressionism. Were there really 16 first and 14 second violins? The string section looked smaller on the platform, and sounded it only to allow woodwind and brass their head. Shrill clarinets and piccolo bored through the brain, horns reared up collective-cobra-like; the pinched high double-bass note as Salome, gasping inwardly, awaits Jokanaan’s execution that Strauss took from Berlioz had an eerie slide up to it, and dynamic refinement to spare.Runnicles (pictured above) understands when to tense, release or glide, and how to drop the orchestral levels on the entry of a voice; none of the key moments failed to give goosebumps. After his disappointing Mahler Ninth with an under-engaged BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra earlier at this year's Proms, this was a return to the total mastery of last year’s Tannhäuser. The overriding  impression was one of delicate femininity in ferment. And if this was all about the moon and a love-drunk (or sex-drunk) woman treading the skies, tonight’s Elektra ought to be glaring sun versus blackest night, masculine hard edges – a difficult task to achieve in the Albert Hall. But with this venue, you never can tell. At any rate it did the shot-silk cadences of Salome as proud as the whole ensemble. MORE RICHARD STRAUSS ON THEARTSDESKDer Rosenkavalier, Royal Opera (2009).

396,"Les Troyens, Mariinsky Opera, Gergiev, Festival Theatre, Edinburgh",Les Troyens,Mariinsky Opera,2014-08-29,Christopher Lambton,"The Edinburgh Festival reserved its biggest operatic event for last. From St Petersburg, the Mariinsky Opera brought a production of Berlioz’s Les Troyens that could truly be described as epic: a stellar cast, a vast trompe d’oeil set, and an overall duration comfortably over five hours. A large audience greeted it enthusiastically, but not ecstatically. Maybe exhaustion had set in: there were yawns and smiles in equal measure on the way out.Les Troyens is really two operas. In the first two acts Troy falls to the Greeks after the naïve defenders ignore the prophecies of doom from Cassandra and drag the Trojan horse into the city. After the long supper interval the action moves to Carthage: in an opera that has been more often cut than not, the three acts of Les Troyens à Carthage can be performed on their own – Berlioz composed a prelude specially. They tell of the arrival of Aeneas, his love for Dido, and his compulsion to abandon her to fulfil his divine destiny, which is to create a new country called Italy.From the outset, this production is on a grand scale. The first two acts and the last have a set, designed by stage director Yannis Kokkos, that is defined by a huge reflective surface that angles up steeply from the back of the stage. The effect is that the audience not only sees the singers from the front but also from above. The chorus effectively doubles in size and any antics on the stage floor become a simultaneous backdrop. It is not a glass mirror, or even a rigid surface (occasionally it rippled) but for the most part the reflection from the screen is so perfect it is quite difficult to see where reality stops and the reflection begins. The screen was also visually porous so that images of Troy burning could be projected behind it.It is clever, but unsettling, and slightly distracts from the magnificent attempts of Cassandra - sung by Mlada Khudoley at short notice - to avert disaster (Cassandra with the women's chorus pictured right). Her voice alone could do it, but her acting is less convincing. For good movement on stage we have to look at the extended ballet episodes. Ladies in the audience (I was told on good authority) particularly liked the half-naked muscular young men who fight and pirouette. The great octet and chorus in scene two, however, shows just what a great and moving sound conductor Valery Gergiev can produce with his orchestra, soloists, and a large chorus.Les Troyens à Carthage has simpler, smaller, stage machinery. Carthage looks a bit like an architect’s model and the Trojan fleet is represented by cut-out white ships dangling from strings. But Act IV opens with a magnificent otherworldly representation of Dido’s gardens, which behind multiple gauze screens become a huge rustling northern pine forest in which odd shapes glow and horses fleetingly appear.At about this point in the opera the emphasis switches, imperceptibly, from affairs of state to those of love. Aeneas and Dido are getting on so well that the minister Narbal warns of disaster in a great aria just perfect for the sock-trembling bass Yury Vorobiev. But the music soars heavenward and before long the lovers have the wonderful duet “night of endless ecstasy” where Ekaterina Semenchuk’s richly voiced Dido and finds a marginally more acidic counterpoint in Sergey Semishkur’s Aeneas (pictured with Semenchuk). But, even in a heavily stylised production, the acting is unconvincing – far too many hands waved in the air and clasped to the ear.Les Troyens contains much beautiful music, here wonderfully performed, but the scope of Berlioz’s invention is not quite equal to the scale of his creation, and there are moments when one realises why full a full staging is still a relative rarity. Writing about the opera, the 19th Century critic Pierre Scudo said: “If he has failed, he has failed magnificently”.

397,"Guglielmo Tell, Teatro Regio Torino, Noseda, Usher Hall, Edinburgh",Guglielmo Tell,Teatro Regio Torino,2014-08-27,Hanna Weibye,"First, confessions. I’m the dance critic here at theartsdesk. Yes, this is a review of a concert performance of an opera, and no, I haven’t picked up a detailed knowledge of Rossini’s oeuvre as a byproduct of my education in pirouettes and Pina Bausch. I attended last night’s concert as a common or garden punter, and a chance one at that, taking a ticket to save wasting it after its original owner had to give it up because of a work commitment.Alexandra wrote a piece the other week about what opera has to offer the under-30s. Though I’m far from an opera novice, I am in that demographic and I had no idea who Gianandrea Noseda was; I would never have bought a ticket for a four-hour concert performance of Rossini’s Guglielmo Tell myself. But if you offered me the chance to go back again tonight, I would drop everything and go, and here’s why.The opera is based on Schiller’s play about the legendary Swiss freedom fighter, William Tell (pictured right). Schiller wrote it in the heady years after the French Revolution, when the passionate young intellectuals of Europe thought freedom finally had a chance of becoming a live political principle. Rossini’s opera comes from the late 1820s, a time when revolution was brewing again in Europe because the freedom genie of 1789 refused in the end to stay in the bottle constructed for it after 1815. This is a work steeped in real history: if that of Switzerland appears a little misty, it’s because it’s overlaid with the story of all the European national and constitutional movements (small and esoteric as many of them were) which since 1789 had taken ‘Liberty!’ as their battle cry. As history plays go, it doesn’t get more inspiring than this.  Plus, it has family relationships, a frustrated love affair, and a couple of kickass female characters (Anna Maria Chiuri as Edwige and Angela Meade as Matilde) who ace the Bechdel test.Of course, if big themes and real history alone made for a spellbinding evening, we’d all be at home reading Gibbon's Decline and Fall and wouldn’t have needed to invent IMAX cinemas. We want thrills and energy too. Gianandrea Noseda was crackling with those, conducting with his whole body and the thrumming physical intensity of a boxing bout. I’ve seen dance performances with less jumping than this remarkable 50-year old supplied, his two feet clean leaving the podium over and over again. Everyone else on stage had caught his fire, and when you harness that kind of energy to making sound - I’d say you’d need a lot of electricity to produce the same volume with amps.“Acoustic” in music often means “a bit gentle and intimate” but by God, not when you’re talking about an Italian symphony orchestra and chorus in full flow. If Elton John had written 'Bennie and the Jets' about last night’s soloists and the Teatra Regio Torino chorus (pictured left in the theatre's staged production), he’d have written “you’re gonna hear acoustic music, solid walls of sound!” And these sound walls are not flat like concrete, but gilded and moulded, varicoloured and gorgeous – like the Usher Hall itself (which incidentally must surely be the only grand civic building in the world which manages to pull off lilac-based décor).I didn’t know the opera at all, apart from that iconic overture, but the music was fantastic - rich, tuneful, varied, evocative. You hear the peasants dancing, the waters rushing in the dangerous eddies of Lake Lucerne. The famous incident with Tell’s son (Marina Bucciarelli) and the apple is tense, and gripping. And in the Usher Hall’s incredible, clear acoustic, Noseda and the Teatro Regio Torino orchestra make it all sound brand new, like 1000 thread count cotton sheets fresh out of their packaging - crisp and colourfast.As a mark of musico-sartorial achievement, it puts Kylie's gold hotpants into perspective The achievement of technological and human symbiosis in an orchestra blows my mind. Instruments made of nothing fancier than wood and catgut and people, plain, un-digitally-enhancd people, manipulating them with an intricate skill that in each case has taken decades of hard work to acquire. Watching dozens of players with their fingers flying, their bows dancing madly, all in harmonious co-motion, to produce an effect of unrivalled subtlety and complexity – I’d say a Mexican wave in a huge sports stadium might about match it for thrill. If the wavers were reciting the Iliad as they went. In Greek. Electrifying doesn’t cut it: the sight of so many people pouring all their guts and energy into something so complex is awe-inspiring.And the singers! We’re the YouTube generation, “hey, look at this video of a man doing backflips on the Empire State Building” our equivalent of rubbernecking on the street. We should be out watching opera. Look at John Osborn (pictured left), who played Arnoldo last night. He’s a normal looking chap, could be your cousin, or your estate agent. But he can make a sound in his own body that makes a huge concert hall shake and actual wood and plaster vibrate: he can set hundreds of cubic metres of air suddenly roiling with soundwaves, like a whirlpool jacuzzi buzzed into life. And he can sustain the sound, and shape it to create words and emotions. If this were a staged opera he could do all that, and make love to a lady while wearing a jerkin and a stupid hat. As a mark of musico-sartorial achievement, it puts Kylie’s dancing and singing in gold hotpants into perspective, it really does.When Osborn's Arnold proclaims that William Tell (Dalibor Jenis) will be saved from his unjust death sentence, he spits “Non morrà!” with flashing eyes, as if his backbone were made from girders. It’s Gandalf saying “you shall not pass” but at 100-plus decibels, for several minutes, with 65 backing singers and two dozen high Cs.By the last scene I’d forgotten about following the libretto in the programme. The music tells the story - you didn’t need words to know that the showdown between courageous, hard-as-nails Tell and the Austrian tyrant Gessler (Luca Tittoto) ended badly for the latter. It culminated in all the soloists and chorus belting out “Libertà! Libertà!” at full volume – and, well, if my hair wasn’t blown straight out behind me like a flag in a Force Five, then it should have been. It’s enough to make you want to be Swiss. And certainly, certainly enough to make anyone, of any age, seek out more performances of this fabulous work by these fabulous people.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/guglielmo-tell-teatro-regio-torino-noseda-usher-hall-edinburgh,5

Not a hear-how-clever-I-am-to-get-the-laborious-operatic-joke laugh, or an I-realise-this-is-supposed-to-be-funny-so-I’m-playing-along one, but a real, spontaneous laugh that tickles into sound before you’ve even had time to register its approach. Back for its second appearance, Robert Carsen’s Glyndebourne Rinaldo is ingenious and witty, joyous and completely over-the-top, and the best possible ending to this year’s summer opera season.Back in 2011 the show was great, but still felt like a work-in-progress. Three years on, and Rinaldo is back and suddenly everything that was slightly blurry before has snapped into focus and the results are slick and seriously entertaining.A frankly daft Crusading plot is reworked as the cartoonish fantasies of a schoolboy. Bullied by his classmates and bored of his history lesson, he recasts the Crusades with himself as warrior-hero Rinaldo and his teachers as wicked queen Armida and the Saracen king Argante. Rinaldo’s beloved Almirena – a speccy blonde with Heidi-plaits, first glimpsed as a photo that the schoolboy lover is enthusiastically snogging – is captured not by the hellish Furies of mythology, but rather a troupe of feral, St Trinians-inspired schoolgirls who set about their victim with lacrosse sticks and black painted fingernails.There will be those who say that such a riotous reworking fatally undermines the opera, trading drama for cheap laughs. But really, what drama? There’s the unconvincing moment when Armida intends to kill Rinaldo but finds herself suddenly seduced by his beauty instead, or the moment Almirena talks herself out of captivity in a fairly brisk conversation and a few tears. This opera, designed as the young Handel’s calling-card for the London stage, is as much about spectacle as action. Its plot is overwrought, exaggerated beyond conviction (even by Handel’s standards) and would fall flat with a contemporary audience if played straight.Carsen’s skill here is in taking a simple conceit and extending it to its logical limits. Every detail in his fantasy schoolroom Crusade is ingenious; the jokes keep coming and the two worlds keep on dovetailing so neatly and so whimsically that you can’t but grin at the boisterous elegance of it all. From the trials of Armida’s evil monsters (an explosive chemistry lab) to rearing and prancing horses (bicycles) and the opera’s climactic battle, transformed here into a blissfully choreographed football match, the whole production glows with love and thought.Carsen’s concept is a strong one, but the cast selling it are equally strong. In 2011, Sonia Prina’s Rinaldo was ballsy and pugnacious but not terribly funny. Countertenor Iestyn Davies (pictured left with Furies) brings the same clarity and virtuosity to his coloratura, while also supplying the humour that ties this show together. He sets the tone for a cast alive to every comic possibility, while periodically pausing to remind us just how beautifully he can spin a legato line, how expressively he can ornament a da capo.Davies’ bright, projected tone finds a softer foil in Tim Mead’s Goffredo, particularly fine in his moving final aria. It’s tough competition for fellow countertenor Anthony Roth Costanzo, who makes his Glyndebourne debut as the young Eustazio, displaying a sweet but sometimes slightly nasal tone.Karina Gauvin steps into Armida’s dominatrix stilettos with panache. Hers is a pedigree Handel voice, creamily full and even throughout, and rather than play the queen as a one-dimensional villain, she finds a humanity to her violence and vengeance that helps anchor Carsen’s wilder fantasies. She’s well matched in Joshua Hopkins’ Argante, storming and plotting in some of Handel’s finest music.Conductor Ottavio Dantone’s speeds seem to have settled since 2011, and the relationship between pit and stage is greatly improved. Only Almirena’s exposed unison aria with solo violin “Bel piacere” teeters slightly. It’s good to her The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment sounding so much like a European band – bolder, more rhetorical than often – and it helps add clarity to musical drama that could easily get lost among so much onstage activity.Baroque in every way, Robert Carsen’s Rinaldo is Handel opera reimagined for a contemporary audience. Little of the composer’s original plot may remain, but all of his joyous invention and spectacle does – reanimated by some healthy irreverence and an eye for detail. This is opera, certainly, but it’s also entertainment, and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/rinaldo-glyndebourne-festival-opera-0,5

400,"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Opera Holland Park",Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,Opera Holland Park,2014-08-03,David Nice,"“What does opera have to say to the under-30s?” asked Alexandra Coghlan on theartsdesk yesterday. The question “what does opera have to say to the under-10s?” has had to wait until today. For although yesterday afternoon’s performance of Will Todd’s newish opera for children of all ages was the last in its second, sell-out run on the Yucca Lawn behind Holland Park House, it seemed essential to make my four-year-old goddaughter Mirabel available for comment, and that was the only date available in her diary. The answer? Another wildly enthusiastic “plenty”, from her, mother, aunt and me.Finland already has it right: the two children’s operas I happened to catch there on two different recent visits made truly operatic demands of the singers and gave the orchestral musicians plenty of rewarding stuff to play. We’re getting there. There was Jonathan Dove's The Adventures of Pinocchio for Opera North, and Todd’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland is a shining example, even if the “adventures” aren’t quite what Lewis Carroll had in mind. Maggie Gottlieb’s libretto uses the original text only as a point of departure for further fantasy in a canny mix of Gilbertiana with contemporary references.Alice’s dream here is rather more logical than Carroll’s fluid, picaresque journey, entering a world where animals are persecuted by over-rational humans led by a Red Queen (or Queen of Hearts, it doesn't matter) whose murderous intentions are flagged up quite scarily long before “her” appearance. Yet it also offers more of a plot, expertly steered by experienced director Martin Duncan. Christopher Wheeldon's stylish Royal Ballet version was admirably faithful to the first of the two Alice books, but also plagued even in its revision by longueurs and sometimes the victim of its own visual lavishness. Leslie Travers’ designs here are simpler but brilliant, the handful of tricks all offering an old Victorian-style magic which surely delights the kids just as much.The real pleasure is in everyone, musicians included, making four moves around the garden, the children happily adapting to take their places right at the front where few move around or fidget (Mirabel did flee back to mum in alarm at the appearance of the Red Queen). We begin in black, white and grey contemporary “Grimthorpe” – no first “e” so as not to offend the home of one of Britain’s best bands – with Alice, her parents and her greedy brat brothers, ripe for metamorphosis as Dum and Dee, taking shelter from the rain in a pet shop. The White Rabbit in the cage (James Cleverton) can sing, so why, Alice wonders, can’t he let himself out? Lack of opposable thumbs, slow evolution, he declares. So she lets him loose and the adventures begin, involving time travel back to the Victorian era.Musically the idiom is jazz meshed with Sondheimish pauses for lyrical thought and some creepy mood music for what’s wrong in Wonderland. There’s a coloratura-soprano “drink me” bottle (Maud Millar), a counter-tenor Cheshire Cat (Magid El-Bushra) whose grin appears on a stick when his blue personage disappears – and who scared the hell out of a toddler in the after-show mingling – and a laid-back, ganja-loving (one presumes) Caterpillar, the marvellous Keel Watson, whose “Wonderland Blues” are the highlight of the opera, for me at any rate.After the first three picture postcards, we spend longer under the trees with the wind made audible through them and sun dappling the shadowier scene at the Mad Hatter’s steeply-raked tea party. It's here that the Red Queen (Robert Burt, Alice’s dad in drag, very amusing) first shows up (pictured above). There’s a rather beguiling aria of all things beginning with “H” from Patricia Orr’s Duchess, metamorphosed from didactic Humpy Dumpty – I assumed she was the White Queen, but it doesn’t matter here – and seeking old love Hatter (Victoria Simmonds) and the only song adapted from the original for John Lofthouse’s White Knight, distracting a few kids from Alice's pretty, big monologue as he appears on the lawn with a kettle on his head behind the audience.The denouement is witty and swiftly done: animals put to work in the Queen’s “kitchen from hell” rise up and find out that the executions were a mere house-of-cards threat; everyone sings a big, somewhat sub-Sondheim number before the “it was only a dream, or was it?” epilogue.There’s plenty to sustain the interest. Fflur Wyn, most delightful of light lyric sopranos, charms or channels the childrens’ disquiet throughout, as Alice: no wonder she was Mirabel’s favourite (we got to meet her afterwards, pictured above). Second and third in her books were the Cat, who sang some funny things, and the “Capertillar”, who sang some more she couldn’t quite understand but liked all the same.The 11-piece “Alice band”, conducted yesterday by Natalie Murray Beale, has various textures: dark and rumbly for the blues, brass-punchy for the Queen’s music, adding a bit of dissonant spice to Alice's moments of confusion or despair, and while the players carry their chairs and the crowd moves on the continuity is provided by a Victorian choral quartet. I’d love to say go see it where you can, but – unlike the Bubble Theatre, whose Alice Through the Looking Glass provided equal site-specific magic some years back – this team isn’t going on tour. Next year, perhaps: this one should run and run.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/alices-adventures-wonderland-opera-holland-park,4
401,"Prom 6: Der Rosenkavalier, LPO, Ticciati",Prom 6: Der Rosenkavalier,LPO,2014-07-23,Kimon Daltas,"If last year’s Ring cycle triumphantly proved that world-class opera can be done at the Albert Hall, this Rosenkavalier suggests that the less epic end of the repertoire isn’t such a sure thing. That is not to say that this performance was dud, far from it; rather that its few problems were venue related. Balance was the main issue, though Robin Ticciati did a great job of whipping the London Philharmonic Orchestra into a passionate frenzy in the Prelude and then taking things down a notch and keeping them there to avoid engulfing the voices. The audience will have had a different experience depending on where they were sitting, or indeed standing: it is always said that the promenaders get the best sound though it is unlikely to have been the case here, with the singers on a platform set above and behind the orchestra.With that introductory negativity out of the way, the actual performance element deserves glowing praise. The makeshift stage allowed plenty of room for the singers to act – by no means a given – and with the Glyndebourne costumes intact and some crucial furniture and props, there was enough to nudge this into the realm of a genuine theatrical experience.Of the advertised cast – the same that appeared at Glyndebourne – two dropped out at late notice due to illness, but it is hard to imagine them being much better than their replacements, with Franz Hawlata (Baron Ochs) and Louise Alder (Sophie) taking on their linchpin roles with great assurance. Hawlata (pictured below right), who has sung Ochs many times before (most recently in Birmingham), captured the privileged buffoonery perfectly. Alder, who got a few bites of the cherry understudying her role at Glyndebourne, confirmed that she’s ready for top billing, with her delicate, floated ""himmlische"" on smelling the rose being one of the most memorable moments.Kate Royal made her journey from saucy to imperious as the Marschallin, anchoring the bittersweet centre of the piece, while Tara Erraught’s Octavian was every bit the young peacock strutting about hardly believing his luck, as well as doing a great comic turn as the bumpkin Mariandel.The richly indulgent trio which brings the three leads together in Act 3 was paced beautifully by Ticciati though, again, one suspects those listening at home on the radio might have had an improved balance between singers and orchestra.The smaller roles all worked together towards the satisfying whole, not least Michael Kraus (Faninal), Miranda Keys (Marianne), and the scheming duo of Valzacchi and Annina played with gusto by Christopher Gillett and Helene Schneiderman. Honourable mention too for Andrej Dunaev whose moment in the spotlight as an over-the-top Italian tenor was delightfully embraced.It was a shame that a choice was made to issue a full libretto to programme buyers rather than put up a few surtitle screens. On the one hand it meant that those on a budget were severely disadvantaged; on the other, that those with the booklet tended to be buried in it. Also, what was printed was the full Hugo von Hofmannsthal text, complete with stage directions, which were not necessarily followed by Richard Jones’s production (adapted by Sarah Fahie for the Proms) . From the six-foot tall ‘little black boy’ to the Baron’s flesh wound (upper arm in the libretto, more amusingly the bottom on stage) these were minor but also easily avoided distractions.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/prom-6-der-rosenkavalier-lpo-ticciati,4
402,"La traviata, Glyndebourne",La traviata,Glyndebourne,2014-07-18,David Nice,"Some of us have witnessed Traviatas where single stars were born: Angela Gheorghiu for Solti at the Royal Opera nearly 20 years ago springs quickest to mind. Some would claim a dream couple in Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazon on peak form at Salzburg. Yet how often in a lifetime do you catch an evening like this, where all three principals are not only up to the very highest vocal standards but also work as one with the conductor to make sense of every phrase, every word, in an intimate space for which Verdi's chamber opera might have been crafted?Mark Elder, conducting a London Philharmonic Orchestra responsive to each inflection, can take even higher credit at Glyndebourne than director Tom Cairns, whose layered, timeless response within Hildegard Bechtler’s tripartite, semi-abstract sets sometimes eluded me but who seems to be saying that even when happiness seems briefly so obtainable for two people, everyone – courtesan, lover and paternal pillar of unyielding society – is alone. But never coldly or impersonally so: Elder so painstakingly underpins every heartbeat, each of Verdi’s rhythms, bass lines and musical twists to the sorrow in the text that a stupendous tension, rather than just a deep sadness leading to the usual indulgent weepfest at Violetta’s last moments, informs the entire performance.For this the soprano, tenor and baritone need to be open to every nuance, and here they are; I’ve never seen a production so alive to all the emotional confusion and psychological complexity, if reluctant to provide easy resolutions. In Act One the finest flexibility seems to belong to Michael Fabiano’s Alfredo, out of his depth at a sophisticated party but determined to bare his soul, his love for the sick woman at the centre, in a context which would seem to forbid it.Russian soprano Venera Gimadieva, in another Glyndebourne debut of stunning impact, doesn’t quite match him turn for turn in the Brindisi or flash out every semiquaver of diamantine brilliance in her determination to forget the possibility of devotion and to plunge into the vortex of Parisian social life (note how in the phrase “cross and delight”, he emphasises the agony, she in her later echo the pleasure). But a true coloratura Violetta won’t have the strength Verdi's Violetta needs to face the denigration of Alfredo’s father and the laceration of sacrifice. Perhaps the very highest notes lose the incredible fullness to which Gimadieva opens up as she rises, but the climactic cries of “love me, Alfredo” pierce the heart with full vocal weight and intensity.Tassis Christoyannis, returning to cap his Glyndebourne triumph as the jealous Ford in Falstaff, portrays a man whose bluff certainty of what society expects founders very quickly on the reef of Violetta’s dignity. Father and “fallen woman” pace round each other warily and powerfully in a masterly portrayal of uncertainty and bewilderment, for which I guess we have Cairns to thank.While Gimadieva presses the right emotional buttons with her pianissimo singing at the core of the duet, as she is even more devastatingly to do in the big party-scene ensemble placed after the interval, Christoyannis (pictured left with Fabiano) also captures the right shades and colours expected of that rare species, the true Verdi baritone. Elder’s pacing allows him to sing the sentimental cavatina begging his son to remember family life in Provence in long lines which make as much sense as those of Violetta’s more swiftly paced “Addio del passato” in Act 3, a radical rethink which, as with the waltz-duet of possible happiness which follows it, takes some getting used to. And the furious response of Fabiano’s son to paternal self-regard, capped by wild jealousy when he learns where Violetta's gone, has an impassioned pressure which gives us glimpses of a possible future Otello in the young, infinitely sensitive lirico spinto tenor voice.For once, this makes a powerful curtain to a first half which stops short of the Act Two finale. After the long supper break, Elder sends even the party dances ricocheting, with impeccably alert work as ever from the Glyndebourne chorus – the very small supporting roles are also cast from strength, chiefly the Annina of Magdalena Molendowska – and ignites the almost unbearable tension of the big encounter where Alfredo believes the love of his life has abandoned him for wealth and tinsel. Cairns underlines Violetta’s greatness of soul, and its powerlessness against bigger forces, by the way she forgivingly moves slowly towards the man who’s assaulted her, and then equally slowly back as the group around her edges in.By the hour of her death the isolation is total against the now encroached walls, while the moment of greatest togetherness is underlined as the most desperate, its nihilistic message hammered home (“If you haven’t saved me by returning, no one on earth can do it”). I didn’t quite buy Violetta's final, lonely walk to a death – the mythic aspect worked better in Peter Konwitschny’s otherwise coldly calculating ENO production – but the roars of approval, the isolated attempts to get the whole house standing, which in my experience it never has, showed that this shattering work, with its pull between the sublime in the music and the bleak tragedy of the true-life story, had achieved its highest mark.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-traviata-glyndebourne,5
403,"Così fan tutte, European Opera Centre, RLPO, Pillot, St George’s Hall Concert Room, Liverpool",Così fan tutte,European Opera Centre,2014-07-15,Glyn Môn Hughes,"One of the joys of attending an opera in the Concert Room at St George’s Hall, Liverpool, is the feeling that the audience is sitting in the set itself. Now one of the city’s foremost concert venues, this Victorian gem never ceases to amaze, even though it was reintroduced to active use in 2006 after extensive refurbishment. This summer and autumn, much of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic’s musical activity has decamped to the venue as the Philharmonic Hall has closed for a multi-million pound refurbishment and partial rebuild.So it was that the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra came together with the city-based European Opera Centre for this production of Così fan tutte. In many ways, the intimate setting – the hall only seats around 500 – made the audience really feel part of the action and, unlike in large theatres, it was possible to see the small gestures, facial expressions and general camp silliness which made the production such a success. It was also musically extremely bright: there are no carpets or curtains to dull the sound and the bare walls exposed every note, leaving nothing uncovered.Joanne Milanese designed a simple set which worked perfectly. The first act was set in a photographic studio where Fiordiligi and Dorabella – two comically spoilt brats – are being photographed by Don Alfonso for various advertising campaigns. And while they are acting as aspiring starlets, Despina spends much of her time puncturing the bubble in which they live. Just as the women populate a make-believe world, so do the men with Ferrando and Gugliemo veering between bumbling idiots and suave men-of-the-world.The only mystery in the production itself was why the main characters suddenly donned 18th century costume for the first part of the second act. That was strange, bearing in mind that the whole of the black-grey and shocking pink theme of the costumes throughout was applied to modern, and often very flattering, dress. Maybe a question for costume designer Natacha Costechareire.Overall, though, conductor Laurent Pillot ran a well-paced performance with absolutely no let-up in the action. The real stars, however, were the six singers, products of one of Liverpool’s real musical secrets. The European Opera Centre was founded in 1997 and has specialised not only in nurturing musical talent but has also unearthed and produced rare and unusual repertoire, working with major performers and ensembles around the world. This foray into perhaps more mainstream repertoire is as welcome as it is rather rare.There was a real confidence on the part of the performers. Of particular note was tenor Alexander Sprague, singing Ferrando – catch him in Welsh National Opera’s Moses und Aaron at the Royal Opera House later this month. He was sprightly, funny, and has a voice which projected unstrained purity. Héloïse Mas, making her UK début, gave an assured performance as Dorabella but was rather eclipsed by soprano Nazan Fikret, whose comic Fiordiligi was excellent.But, if there was a prize for comedy and for adaptability, it had to go to Hamida Kristoffersen (pictured above, on the left), who sang Despina. It might not be as big a role as the others, but her facial expressions and, in particular, her interpretation of a wizened old lawyer, was unforgettable. With all its pointed campness, charm, assured poise of the singers and comic wit, this was a production which would be hard to rival.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/cos%C3%AC-fan-tutte-european-opera-centre-rlpo-pillot-st-george%E2%80%99s-hall-concert-room-liverpool,4
404,"Diaghilev Festival Gala, London Coliseum",Diaghilev Festival Gala,London Coliseum,2014-07-14,David Nice,"Bakst’s harem drapes and Roerich’s smoking, steaming Polovtsian camp may not have had the most lavish of recreations. But the rest of this homage to Diaghilev shone with an exuberance and even a precision one would not have thought possible from previous seasons of what had once seemed like Andris Liepa’s Ballets Russes vanity project. Mariinsky star of long standing Yulia Makhalina sprinkled gala stardust, the corps of the revelatory Natalia Sats Children’s Theatre re-enacted Fokine’s routines with theatrical flair and that energy levels were so high throughout had everything to do with the superlative work of company conductor Alevtina Ioffe (pictured below) – the real star of the visit along with the amazingly good house orchestra, as warm audience cheers and applause confirmed.The choreographic execution was never about technique, though there's still cause to wonder at the extensions and other sinuosities of the ever-compelling Makhalina, who gave a gala bonus with a “Dying Swan” not far off that of her junior Ulyana Lopatkina’s for poetry and pointe. As one balletomane I met declared, “Scheherazade is tosh, but they make it look like Shakespeare”. Which is to say that the harem naughtiness, so very 1910, was even a bit sexy for once: you could believe that handsome Artem Yachmennikov’s Golden Slave had a devoted crush on Makhalina’s utterly commanding dominatrix Zobeide.Fokine’s reading of the Rimsky-Korsakov score is mostly perverse, though he knew better than to set the opening “Sea and Sinbad’s Ship” to dance: only Ioffe’s interpretation, as compelling as any I’ve ever heard in the concert hall and glowingly executed by her fabulous orchestra, could have held the attention so while the lurid drop-curtain remained down.It’s in the big company dances, though, that Fokine excels, and the Sats corps executed them way beyond anything I’d thought possible in the fussy new choreography for The Golden Cockerel on Wednesday. Yes, they really did have the numbers and the costumes to carry off the final “orgy” – a perfect realization of Korsakov’s many strands which gave the cue to Stravinsky for what Fokine could do in The Firebird’s Infernal Dance. Fokine’s Polovtsian scenes and dances for Prince Igor have become definitive, and what fun it was to see the diminutive Maxim Pavlov give his all and flash his teeth as furry-hatted chief tribesman. The Sats Theatre’s full-bodied chorus were in the side boxes for their Polovtsian vocalizations, a little loud for the hard-working orchestra at times, but again the real thing. If the so-called “choreography” for Novaya Opera's dismally staged Prince Igor earlier this year was the worst I’ve ever seen, this was absolutely the best.We also got the whole of the (short) final act of The Golden Cockerel (pictured left by Elena Lapina), rather charmingly prefaced by Liepa taking us through the denouement like the true man of the theatre he is. I was happy to encounter again five of the six excellent singers I’d seen on Wednesday – the roles had been double, or treble, cast – above all to get the extraordinary mix of full and falsetto high notes from Ruslan Yudin’s tenor altino Astrologer. That he was supposed to be Diaghilev the presenter-impresario could have escaped no-one this time as Wednesday’s ultimate black wall behind the Goncharova recreations was replaced with a full photo of the great man, against which Makhalina danced her swansong, actually a 1905 Fokine creation for Pavlova in St Petersburg.Liepa was evidently sincere in dedicating the whole evening to Diaghilev's genius (though historical revisionist turned Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky will no doubt tell us that the great man, like Tchaikovsky, was too good to be gay). Ultimately there were two other overwhelming dominant presences: Rimsky-Korsakov, without whom even Borodin’s dances (pictured by Elena Lapina) would not glitter as they do, and Ioffe, who never put a foot wrong, dared much with her excellent players and is clearly up there with Susanna Mälkki as a conductor fit to stand with the best. If the west doesn’t poach her, may she come back with the company and – special request – can they piece together Prokofiev’s Chout with the designs of Goncharova’s almost as talented partner Mikhail Larionov for the next visit?",https://theartsdesk.com/dance/diaghilev-festival-gala-london-coliseum,4
405,"theartsdesk in Buxton: Dvořák rarity, Gluck tercentenary",theartsdesk in Buxton: Dvořák rarity,Gluck tercentenary,2014-07-14,philip Radcliffe,"Buxton has gone Bohemian, digging into Dvořák’s treasure trove and celebrating Gluck’s tercentenary. The choice of Dvořák’s The Jacobin fits the Buxton Festival tradition of rooting out neglected works, since this has been unjustly overlooked since the first performance in 1889. It’s an irony that this makes Gluck’s Orfeo ed Euridice an unexpected choice, being ever-popular since 1762. However, artistic director Stephen Barlow has linked them for the festival’s two new home-grown productions for this, the 36th festival.Director Stephen Unwin gives us a moderately updated version of The Jacobin. Instead of a small Bohemian country town in 1793, he moves it on to the 1930s Czechoslovak Republic, not that you would notice apart from the odd suit. This is a pleasant peasant opera with the community at the centre in the form of an almost ever-present 32-strong chorus, made up of the Buxton Festival Chorus and children from the local Kinder Children’s Choir. Their singing is a joy, they keep busy and they capture the togetherness of village life. Fittingly, the first performance coincided with Buxton’s annual Carnival Day, when this community celebrates with a procession, rose queens, well-dressings and funfair.The Jacobin is a heart-warming tale of family feud, love and reconciliation. It’s also about concern for peasant conditions, expressed by Bohuš, estranged from his father who rules the town as Count and believes mistakenly that while in Paris his son has become a violent Jacobin revolutionary. The opera opens with the chorus, frozen like a rear-of-stage tableau, singing a hymn, just before Bohuš and his wife Julie appear carrying suitcases. He has returned to his homeland to seek reconciliation with his father.That’s the thread. There is also an on-going love tangle between Terinka, daughter of Benda the music master at the village school, and local lad Jiří, which gives rise to some memorable duets between Anna Patalong and Matthew Newlin (pictured above). Benda, a fussy and lovable comic character splendidly realised by Bonaventura Bottone, wants his daughter to move up in the world by marrying Filip, an old officer (the excellent Nicholas Folwell).So, there is a strong narrative over the three acts. After a fairly flat start, the opera really takes off in Act Two, where Benda, conducting and counting, is rehearsing the chorus, together with Terinka and Jiří, in his own “Mozartian” composition intended to entertain the Count. This scene alone justifies the attribution of “comic opera” to The Jacobin. The final act of reconciliation is inspired by a lovely lullaby beautifully sung by Anne Sophie Duprels with harp accompaniment, a Dvořák inspiration. Bohuš, portrayed with dignity by Nicholas Lester, embraces his father (the rich-voiced Andrew Greenan) and the chorus assembles with candles and flowers.With the libretto sung in English (Rodney Blumer’s revised translation), Dvořák’s rich and tuneful score was spiritedly conducted by Barlow with the resident Northern Chamber Orchestra, reflecting the peasants’ inbred love of song and dance. The staging is plain and simple against an ever-present backdrop of a cloud-filled sky. However, designer Jonathan Fensom scores with his attention to detail in the appearance and make-up of the chorus, putting me in mind of, say, Fiddler on the Roof or Les Mis. And they are managed well by choreographer Lucy Hinds. The work proves itself worth reviving, being affectionate and essentially joyful, even if too long by at least 20 minutes.Director Stephen Medcalf has come up with an effective modern version of Orfeo and Euridice. It opens backstage at what might be Glastonbury, with Orfeo like an ageing rock star (think Brian May or Rick Wakeman) taking his bow, with his name in big letters suspended above. These moveable and multi-purpose capital cut-outs are the simple but ingenious invention of designer Francis O’Connor. Coming offstage, Orfeo is mobbed by fans wearing Orfeo T-shirts and baseball caps.This sets the tone for Medcalf’s focused and refreshing production, which wrests all the drama out of the masterpiece, the music flowing from the NCO under Stuart Stratford’s alert control. The singing is first-rate, with countertenor Michael Chance (pictured above) as an older but still passionate and affecting Orfeo. In the Italian soprano Barbara Bagnesi he has a fetching, waif-like Euridice, and rising star Daisy Brown is impressive as Amore. Another telling Medcalf touch is to link the three closely, showing Orfeo and Euridice to be in love with love as well as with each other. And the hard-working Buxton Festival Chorus not only sing splendidly, but fill in the would-be ballet interludes. As has often been the case at Buxton, it goes to show that an illuminating production can be created even on a tight budget.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/theartsdesk-buxton-dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k-rarity-gluck-tercentenary,4
406,"The Queen of Spades, Grange Park Opera",The Queen of Spades,Grange Park Opera,2014-07-11,stephen Walsh,"For my money, The Queen of Spades is one of the great nineteenth-century operas, a masterpiece of dramma per musica. There will always be pure spirits who cry “vulgar” at late Tchaikovsky. But the charge is absurd. Anyone with ears can hear the brilliance and refinement of this music, and anyone with feelings can sense Tchaikovsky’s love of his characters, all of them: the frail, the mad, the villainous, the beautiful and the damned. What more can you ask?It remains, though, essentially a genre piece with supernatural attachments, not very responsive to directorial manipulation. Antony McDonald’s production for Grange Park (revived by Peter Relton) updates it from 1790 (when it’s set) to 1890 (when it was composed), which creates a minor problem for the arrival of Catherine the Great at the masked ball. But otherwise he gives it its head, with mostly stunning results.OK, the Summer Garden and the ball itself are democratised (the ball into a carnival), but with colourful, inventive costumes (by McDonald himself and Hiroko Matsuo) that easily override the cultural solecisms. The children – girls as well as boys – are excellent, cleverly directed, singing good Russian. The crowd choruses, a slightly artificial element in the work’s design, are discreetly touched in with dance (but we lose the pastoral play at the ball, a musical if not dramatic loss).The production is at its most memorable when it zooms in on the beautiful and damnedThe production is at its most memorable, though, when it zooms in on the beautiful and damned: Lisa’s nocturnal visit from Herman, Herman in the old Countess’s bedroom, and above all the wonderful scene in the barracks with the Countess’s funeral kontakion still echoing in his mind. These moments, subtly lit by Paul Keogan, tell me that McDonald has looked at the score and projected the music on to the stage.The sinister economy of Tchaikovsky’s prelude to the bedroom scene – muted violas, pizzicato double basses, soft violins and cellos divisi – is perfectly matched by a single chair in a pool of light mid-stage shrouded in gloom. Bringing in the coffin to the sublimated 1812 music that Tchaikovsky matched to the demise of the imperial old lady (and perhaps the Empire itself) makes perfect sense. Such images need a minimum of visual support, but with strong focus. McDonald clearly understands these things.The performance itself, admittedly, is not without its problems. Mainly they relate to Carl Tanner’s Herman, well enough sung but immobilised as a character by his stately physique. Are we allowed – after the Rosenkavalier hoo-ha – to comment on a singer’s appearance? I think the theatre requires it. Herman, in Pushkin and Tchaikovsky, is a nervy, edgy individual, tormented, insomniac, who probably picks at his food and only drinks water. He might have played Cassius in Julius Caesar. He is (though Pushkin doesn’t quite say so) thin and driven. These things, for all his musical virtues, Tanner will never be.His inertia affects the others. Giselle Allen’s Lisa (pictured right) is at her best when Herman is absent, especially in the canal scene (minus canal in this case), where she is superb. With him a certain languour creeps in, though her switches of mood as he first does then doesn’t show his affection for her by the canal are skilfully handled. She also sings very prettily with Carolyn Dobbin’s Polina in their scene two duet – all three verses, though, which may be one too many.Of the rest, Anne-Marie Owens’s Countess, though healthy-looking for an old lady about to die of shock, is a strong portrait, stylishly sung, and there’s a nicely ironic Tomsky in Gocha Abuladze, though it’s a pity the director allows the rowdy gamblers to drown the exquisite orchestration of his suggestive little Act 3 song. Stephen Gadd’s Yeletsky makes the most of a studiously dull role with one studiously dull aria, and there’s good support from Timothy Dawkins (Surin) and Anthony Flaum (Tchekalinsky), among several others.Gianluca Marciano conducts idiomatically and tidily, with few mishaps, in a score that by no means plays itself. With minor reservations, this is generally a good evening for an opera that has not always been well served on the stage, however brilliant it may look on the page.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/queen-spades-grange-park-opera,4
407,"The Golden Cockerel, Diaghilev Festival, London Coliseum",The Golden Cockerel,Diaghilev Festival,2014-07-10,David Nice,"Rimsky-Korsakov’s bizarre final fantasy, puffing up Pushkin's short verse-tale to unorthodox proportions, has done better in Britain than any of his other operatic fairy-tales. That probably has something to do with its appearance in Paris, six years after the composer’s death in 1908, courtesy of a brave new experiment marshalled by that chameleonic impresario Sergei Diaghilev.So you may well have seen the opera staged before: I remember a trapeze-artist cockerel for Scottish Opera, the old tsar kitted out in a purple suit doing a Yeltsin dance for the Royal Opera. Yet unless you’ve come across it in Russia or Germany you won’t have encountered anything like this brave attempt to homage, rather than strictly recreate - hardly possible, since Fokine’s choreography is lost - Diaghilev’s mix of singers in evening wear at the side and dancers centre stage, and above all the half fauvist, half Russian folk designs of that great genius Natalia Goncharova (original design for Act 1 pictured below).I feared the worst. After all, Andris Liepa’s attempt to conjure up another Ballets Russes extravaganza, Le Dieu bleu, was a mess on every front – tacky, gaudily lit daubs meant to evoke the Bakst designs, vapid choreography and poor dancing. But the shift this time to what I’m going to call, for economy’s sake, the Natalia Sats Children’s Theatre of Moscow has yielded higher quality all round. It’s mind-blowing to think that this company, founded specifically to educate kids and teenagers by the great director who commissioned Prokofiev’s Peter and the Wolf, can yield such high standards.The house orchestra is stupendously good – supple strings, weighty trombones and penetrating trumpets, vivid woodwind arabesques – and guided with such authority by chief conductor Alevtina Yoffe that a work which can sag moves forward handsomely at every stage, with very clear cues to the excellent chorus. Yes, it's a ""she"", of whom Sats would be proud, and puts first completely to shame and then out of mind the asinine misogyny of Vasily Petrenko and Yuri Temirkanov. Another Russian anomaly, then, of the kind which Tom Birchenough describes in his take on the Russian film industry.The idea, adapting the original concept, of singers who double the danced and costumed roles, probably playing a much greater part than back in 1914, takes some getting used to: where do you look, especially when there are surtitles to grapple with too? But when the sometimes undisciplined dancing flags, you can take pleasure in a concert performance – semi-staged, since there’s a fair bit of acting out at the front of the stage. Last night’s cast – astonishing but not untypical that the company can field two, sometimes three singers in each role over three nights – was uniformly excellent. The weird Astrologer who frames the action, in one of Rimsky’s many strangenesses, is a very specific kind of high tenor, and Ruslan Yudin perfectly embodies what the composer must have expected: full and powerful in the altino register, with just a couple of acceptable falsettos.Liepa presents him as a Diaghilevian impresario, fine since he’s one of the two characters with some flesh and blood. The other is the Queen of Shemakha, symbol of the catastrophic lure of the east as she seduces the lethargic old Tsar Dodon towards disaster (eastern imperial campaigns were on both Pushkin’s and Rimsky-Korsakov’s minds nearly a century apart). Reading Cyril Beaumont’s vivid description of the June 1914 London premiere, it’s clear that Tamara Karsavina’s siren, full of ""sly cynicism"", was a manipulator of the Russian puppets around her. Not a trace of that remains in Gali Abaidulov’s choreography: dancer Natalia Savalieva’s queen is just a lithe beauty, clad like her attendants as a conventional if graceful titillator in a costume which isn’t a patch on the one Karsavina wore: the potential feminist point of a clever diva wooed by two old men - a weird enough operatic premise for a love triangle anyway - is almost lost.Making amends is the singer Olga Butenko, a high, bright soprano of a vey specifically Russian timbre, agile in all but the insanely high notes (D and E in alt) which at least she gamely tries rather than substitung or taking them down the octave. She acts out her part with a Cheshire-cat smile, the only snag being that true bass Dmitry Pochapskiy is too young, tall and handsome for the vocal soul of the silly old fool (well mimed, and danced, too, by Dmitry Kruglov). All the other voices are outstanding, led by the piercing cockerel cries of Nataliya Donskaya. Her dance equivalent Mikhael Galiev (scene above by Valerie Komissarova) isn’t quite up to the mark, hideously clad, again so surely – and in this case I’ve not seen the original design – a long way from what Diaghilev and Goncharova envisaged.The Goncharova designs are only partly realized by Vyacheslav Okunev. The drop curtain, a motif the artist had used earlier in preliminary designs for Stravinsky's Les noces (pictured right), would look wonderful if the first of several cheap lighting effects weren’t shone on it. For the action, Liepa and Abaidulov animate the corps de ballet in their toybox colours rather too often, showing us what they know of Fokine’s ensemble dances in The Firebird and Petrushka.Nothing here, then, to ruffle the predator feathers of hatemongering culture minister Vladimir Medinsky, who has the nerve to address us as “dear friends” on the second page of the programme. And Sats’s theatre, by its very nature, can rely on state funding – about which I’m glad, because its musical standards are very high indeed. The company deserves a bigger audience than it got last night. It will be worth going to the ballets to come at least to hear what Ioffe and the orchestra make of the rich scores involved. If you’re just interested in the dancing, though, you may be a bit disappointed.",https://theartsdesk.com/dance/golden-cockerel-diaghilev-festival-london-coliseum,4
408,"Pinnock's Passions, Handel's Garden, Sam Wanamaker Playhouse",Pinnock's Passions,Handel's Garden,2014-07-08,Kimon Daltas,"The latest in a series of ""Pinnock’s Passions"" concerts at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse saw the doyen of period instrument performance lead a delightful exploration of Handel the musical borrower, entitled ""Handel’s Garden"". As Trevor Pinnock writes in the programme notes, ""throughout his life as a composer he had the habit of taking cuttings, transplanting and grafting from works old and new"".In parts this involved playing the original pieces, for instance arias by Reinhard Keiser and Agostino Steffani, followed by Handel’s magpie reworking of them (in Semele and Theodora). The point not being a pedantic illustration of Baroque plagiarism but rather just a thematic link for some wonderful music making.It was a perfect example of what The Globe has been trying to achieve with its musical programming for its new candlelit gem of a theatre – not to be just another concert venue, but to offer curated events that play specifically to the enveloping intimacy and closeness of the audience.Pinnock was a sparkling host, introducing each element with a winning combination of wit and wisdom. And he had of course assembled a top-flight group of musicians to share the stage, with soloists Katharina Spreckelsen (oboe), Katy Bircher (flute) and soprano Lucy Crowe (pictured, below), along with a quintet of strings.Crowe is a versatile and sensitive singer, and had the measure of the space – when you’ve sung at the New York Met, Royal Opera House, the Coliseum, there are adjustments to be made for a room whether the furthest seat is still in spitting distance. Crowe brought her chamber voice and sang with subtlety and precision, while communicating the texts with a touch of theatrical flair. The vocal fireworks of the last item on the programme, ""Tornami a vagheggiar"" from Alcina, were a suitably celebratory finish and the audience’s applause was rewarded further with an unaccompanied rendition of ""Down by the Salley Gardens"".The other soloists got a chance to shine too, with Spreckelsen’s virtuoso turn for the G minor oboe concerto and Bircher’s trilling cameo on the ""Sweet Bird"" aria from L’Allegro, Il Penseroso ed Il Moderato. Cellist Jonathan Byers, of the Badke Quartet, apparently playing for Pinnock for the first time, seemed entirely at home and wonderfully assured in the cello obbligato part in ""What passion cannot Music raise and quell"" from An Ode for St Cecilia’s Day.Pinnock, speculating about whether Handel would approve of his added ornamentation in one piece, finished off to appreciative laughter: “But there we are, it’s my show.” And with his take on the G major harpsichord Chaconne, it certainly was, the veteran proving that he’s still got it, in droves.Pinnock's Passions coclude with ‘A Bach Family Celebration’ on 7 and 8 September.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/pinnocks-passions-handels-garden-sam-wanamaker-playhouse,4
409,"Maria Stuarda, Royal Opera House",Maria Stuarda,Royal Opera House,2014-07-06,alexandra Coghlan,"The Royal Opera House’s Maria Stuarda is the third major production of Donizetti’s historical opera in less than two years. First there was David McVicar’s kitschy-traditional production for the Met, then there was Rudolf Frey’s baffling concept-drama at Welsh National Opera, and now directors Moshe Leiser and Patrice Caurier add their voices to a conversation still trying to make sense of these passionate warring queens with their determinedly dispassionate music.The historical specificities of Donizetti’s story make it particularly resistant to directorial innovation. Whichever way you play it there’s still an awful lot of talk of axes and beheading, Catholicism and the English aristocracy. Leiser and Caurier get around this problem neatly by juxtaposing eras in their staging – keeping the two queens in the 16th century, but framing them with a contemporary cast and set.It’s a collision of contexts that takes a while to settle. Elizabeth’s opening speech, delivered at what seems to be a royal dinner function, lacks gravitas, and her opening aria risks losing its emotional simplicity in the confusion of ideas. But, given time, this collision of worlds proves itself both flexible and surprisingly effective.Just as Donizetti’s music sets the two women apart from everyone else on stage, so their dress keeps them isolated (physically, in the case of Elizabeth’s exaggerated farthingale) and out of sync with their surroundings. These are women playing at the men’s game of politics, condemned to failure whatever their choices, hindered as they are by outmoded and restrictive values and costume. Where McVicar’s visual fidelity risked Python-esque parody at times, this anachronistic setting provokes new reactions to a familiar story. Mary’s wipe-clean contemporary execution chamber is particularly effective in its refusal to romanticise.What the Royal Opera’s production and McVicar’s at the Met have in common is of course Joyce DiDonato in the title role. What the Royal Opera have that the Met didn’t, however, is the extra time for the role to settle and grow for DiDonato (pictured below with Peter Dineen). There’s a spontaneity to her ornamentation here that is less embellishment than organic emotional outpouring, connecting absolutely with body and mind. Her tone is endlessly flexible, colouring Donizetti’s four-square phrases with unexpected shades and stretching the predictable arc of his melodies into shapes that are at once unfamiliar and completely inevitable. It’s a performance that would batter its way into life on recording, and in the flesh is deeply and seriously moving.DiDonato’s intensity is pitted here against the bel canto agility of Carmen Giannattasio as Elisabetta. It’s a shame that visually the directors load the dice so completely against this caricature of a queen, because it unbalances an inequality that is already finely drawn in Donizetti’s writing. Where dignity and passion dominate for Maria, Elisabetta’s writing is all virtuosic tantrums and musical pique – beautiful, certainly, but also brittle. Giannattasio carries it off with aplomb, and if she lacks the depth of colour of DiDonato it’s an absence that character forgives, if not actively demands.The men are more than a little eclipsed by such twin dominance, and though I couldn’t help yearning for Joseph Calleja (who sang Leicester in the Deutsche Oper’s recent concert performances of the opera opposite DiDonato and Giannattasio), young Spanish tenor Ismael Jordi made an attractive substitute – silvery bright of tone, if not yet quite grounded and totally Flórez-secure. Matthew Rose’s Talbot is perhaps the better foil for DiDonato however – matching her depth of timbre, and contributing to the quietly devastating impact of the confessional aria.In the pit, Bertrand de Billy keeps thing moving, drawing some fine playing from brass, especially to balance the chattering brightness of strings and keep the opera from toppling into bel canto self-parody.There will be those who loathe this new, romance-not-included Stuarda, especially coming hot on the stripper-heels of Manon Lescaut. But where Manon felt meretricious in its provocations, there’s a carefully calculated intent to Leiser and Caurier’s anachronisms that surely insures them against any such accusation. If they can’t quite transform Maria Stuarda into a great opera it’s hard to hold it against them. That they transform it into great Donizetti is achievement enough, and no mean one at that.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/maria-stuarda-royal-opera-house,4
410,"The Barber of Seville, Longborough Festival",The Barber of Seville,Longborough Festival,2014-07-04,stephen Walsh,"Speaking from the stage before curtain-up on The Barber, Longborough’s founder and chairman, Martin Graham, stressed the hard work put in by director Richard Studer and conductor Jonathan Lyness on their two 2014 productions, this one and Tosca. He wasn’t kidding. Read the programme and you find (for both operas): director, Richard Studer; designer, Richard Studer; costume, Richard Studer. Lyness conducting both works. These are not jet-setting artists descending on Gloucestershire with their brainstorming concepts, but dedicated craftsmen doing their best for the works in hand. And it shows.Studer’s Barber, sung in English (translator, Richard Studer), is a sparkling and elegant affair which recognises that Rossini’s comedy is a period piece that can’t usefully be relocated or updated. His one conceptual gesture is towards the commedia dell’arte that can well be argued to lie behind all buffo treatments of the subject of the elderly guardian plotting to marry his ward and being outwitted by a clever young rival. So his characters wear powder and rouge, and move, much of the time, in a stylised mecanico choreography that in fact reflects a strong strain of artifice in the music.But the setting itself is naturalistic. Bartolo lives in style, a more-than-successful medico, evidently, amid Palladian columns and well-stacked library shelves. And his ward, Rosina, is not only liberated but deliciously well-dressed: kept in by her guardian but obviously not kept short. As for Almaviva, he may be posing as a poor student or a drunken soldier or a pious music teacher, but he is never really anything but the head-in-air aristo, quick to pull rank with the police, just a little slow with his largesse to his hired serenaders. All these nuances are in Rossini, by the way, and very much part of his wit. And was there ever a wittier score, one whose humour begins more plainly in the music?Sherman, whatever may be in store for her, is indisputably the star of Bartolo’s drawing roomAs ever Studer and Lyness work well together. This is a staging that focuses on movement, occasionally perhaps to excess, but mostly with an ear to the Rossinian style, with its mobile rhythms and repeating mechanisms – a style that positively invites choreography. And the young cast play up to it brilliantly. Grant Doyle is an athletic, likeable Figaro, and a musicianly if not quite memorable baritone, very personable in his “Largo al factotum”, and an excellent guitar mimic in Almaviva’s serenade. Adrian Powter is a solid, not quite detestable Bartolo, at his best in the patter, at which he seems a complete master – no mean feat in English, much speedier than anything in Gilbert and Sullivan. Nicholas Sales’s nicely sung Almaviva is the more believable for being now and then repulsive, a quality that seems to appeal to Helen Sherman’s Rosina (pictured right with Grant Doyle); and, as Figaro hints in Studer’s text, we’ll find the sequel in Mozart.Sherman, though, whatever may be in store for her, is indisputably the star of Bartolo’s drawing room. A proper mezzo, but with a seemingly effortless two-octave range, she uses every inch of her voice and her body to portray this adorable but alas easily misled beauty. Also, unlike many a mezzo, she joins up her registers; and she knows how to use her chest tones with a flicker of sensuality. This is in every way an outstanding performance, full of wit and bravura, compulsively watchable and listenable.The support, too is, good. Julian Close is the usual loud-hailer of a bass Basilio, grand in sonority if not always clear in his words; and Constance Novis makes the most of Berta’s aria, commanding the stage and giving everyone else a breather. The orchestral playing under Lyness has a sparkle that was sometimes absent in Tosca; but then Rossini works better for a Longborough-sized orchestra than Puccini. The racket is joke-racket not post-Wagnerian thunder, and more gesture than decibels.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/barber-seville-longborough-festival,4
411,"The Turn of the Screw, Opera Holland Park",The Turn of the Screw,Opera Holland Park,2014-07-02,alexandra Coghlan,"“Is this sheltered place the wicked world where things unspoken of have been?” The Governess’s question echoes through the careful suggestions and delicate temporal interweavings of Annilese Miskimmon’s The Turn of the Screw, twisting smiles into sordid suggestions, schoolrooms into places not of care but corruption.It takes a bold director to look at the evocative façade of Holland House – all crenellations and architectural ghosts – and then cover it up. Henry James’s Bly couldn’t find a more natural backdrop in any theatre in London, but Miskimmon turns resolutely away from this obvious solution and opts for something a little more layered for Opera Holland Park’s first ever production of a Britten opera.Drawing on the true postwar history of houses like the fictional Bly, Miskimmon and designer Leslie Travers turn to the institutions that gave them new life. In her vision, the Edwardian home of Flora and Miles is glimpsed only in its human echoes. The action of the past plays out in a more contemporary schoolroom, complete with blackboard, an obedient class of blazer-clad boys, and display cabinets that are not all they appear. It’s a natural duality and a juxtaposition that emerges directly from a score that establishes its own two musical worlds in the instrumental variations and the sung scenes.Having set her scene, Miskimmon lets it work itself out without interference. We’ve seen plenty of schoolroom Britten (most recently the astonishing Christopher Alden A Midsummer Night’s Dream at English National Opera), and working this conceit too hard would have robbed it of its quiet and undeveloped menace. Is the science teacher really staring inappropriately at that boy? We just don’t know.Things get rather more direct with Peter Quint (Brenden Gunnell) and Miss Jessel (Elin Pitchard), who leave little doubt of their designs on the children. Travers’ flexible set allows them to materialise with discomfiting suddenness, turning the screw just that little tighter on this operatic ghost story. Here, Quint’s red hair and that of both children proclaims final allegiances before we begin, setting them apart, marking them.It helps that in Rosie Lomas (playing Flora, pictured right with Laugharne) and Dominic Lynch (Miles) Opera Holland Park have a superb pair of singing actors. Though in her mid-twenties, Lomas is every lanky inch Flora, plausibly precocious in her singing (beautifully shaped and controlled) and winsome in her manner. Dominic Lynch’s Miles is strikingly natural, not overworking the sibling chemistry between himself and Lomas, and underplaying the tendency to knowingness that can load the dice too heavily in this opera.The adult cast are led by Ellie Laugharne’s Governess –all warm manner and silvery vocals – whose innocent intentions are beyond question. Her exquisite performance is balanced by Diana Montague's more earthbound Mrs Grose, and the vocal richness and heft of Pritchard’s Miss Jessel. Only Gunnell’s Quint (pictured above) lacks the eeriness to complete the picture as James and Britten paint it.Competing with cricket matches and peacocks for aural supremacy, Opera Holland Park’s more usual repertoire of 19th-century works do occasionally lose the battle. But there’s a wiry intensity to Britten’s remarkably spare scoring here that refuses to fight, simply establishing itself as another –and more urgent – world. Steuart Bedford ensures each essential sonic gesture is heard (underlined by Miskimmon’s thoughtful direction), and the balance with voices is spot on.The Turn of the Screw is something of an experiment for Opera Holland Park, a move away from a familiar and successful operatic formula. But it’s one that has generated the finest show yet this season, and revealed a company that can not only tackle the cast-of-thousands blood and thunder of verismo, but also the miniature delicacy of Britten. I hope that both Miskimmon and this newly extended repertoire make a repeat visit in the future.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/turn-screw-opera-holland-park,4
412,"La finta giardiniera, Glyndebourne",La finta giardiniera,Glyndebourne,2014-06-29,David Nice,"There are two avenues down which to approach the well-kept flower beds of Mozart’s early operas. One is to be surprised how rarely the muse of fire which rages through Idomeneo, his first undisputed masterpiece, descends on a work composed just a few years earlier like La finta giardiniera (The Counterfeit Garden Girl), and that’s how I felt sitting through a performance of it for only the second time in my life. The other is to rejoice in the few signs of things to come, the intimations of immortality, which was clearly the thinking behind its selection by Glyndebourne’s new music director Robin Ticciati.He has the finest of period-instrument orchestras, and seven of the best singers, to support him. Unfortunately they don’t have that much great material to work on, and the shambolic plot/libretto is further obfuscated by Frederic Wake-Walker’s strange, oblique idea of elucidation. I can see what he’s getting at. The characters are all “finti”, faking it, to begin with; the walls of illusion need to be broken down before they can truly love. Each concept, though, takes an act apiece to hammer home. In the first, it’s the 18th-century poses which are done to death, so that you’re screaming for them to stop by the time of the ensemble which brings down the curtain (and at least there are ensembles, if not yet quite in the differentiated vein of Mozart's later operas). In the second, you can see from the off that Anthony McDonald’s beautifully designed replica of an 18th-century pleasure-palace chamber is due for steady demolition; again, the conceit outstays its welcome. And nothing is funny.Most baffling is the decision to keep all the action indoors until the Lustschloss room belatedly gives way to a painted sylvan scene. So no-one unfamiliar with the plot would have a clue that the heroine, the Marchesa Violante, is disguised as a girl gardener to the local mayor; and when she’s supposed to be groping in the dark among the perils of the libretto’s “deserted mountainous spot with ancient, partly ruined acqueducts” and a “dark grotto”, the lights go up full blaze on the crumbling salon, leaving her only the fireplace in which to hide.Very well, so literalism needn’t be the key here. But we need all the clarity we can get, not so much on the “x loves y who loves z” imbroglio as on Sandrina/Violante’s motivations in going back several times on the resolve to reveal herself to the lover who tried to murder her. Even Wake-Walker’s conceit, that in the temporary madness of the main couple lies the truth, confuses, and some clumsy cuts don’t help the final stages where the music is finally at its most consistent best.Perhaps it’s a tall order to try and bring psychological interest to the work’s inconsistent characterisations, but I can’t help feeling Wake-Walker might have worked more with the temperaments of his sympathetic singers. Dramatically the most flamboyant is the wonderful Nicole Heaston as the mayor’s capricious niece Arminda (pictured above right with Rachel Frenkel's Ramiro). This is no role for her to shine consistently in, as she did when I saw her playing Handel’s Alcina in Oslo, but she carries off one of Mozart’s two rather splendid Sturm and Drang numbers with aplomb, and looks terrific in her flouncy costumes. Glyndebourne’s character tenor of choice, Wolfgang Ablinger-Sperrhacke (pictured below with Joélle Harvey, Gyula Orendt and Heaston), gets the chance to sing a little more beautifully than usual, and keeps it low-key as the foolish mayor Don Anchise, probably because he knows that in this production he's not going to make people laugh much, while the trousers role of Ramiro gave lustrous mezzo Frenkel a fine spotlight in the manner, if not the matter, of her big second act numberThe comic underling roles aren’t so much fun, but Harvey, such a captivating Susanna in the Tour production of Michael Grandage’s superb Nozze di Figaro, strikes poses well and tries hard to keep the earthy Serpetta sparkling, while we had an interesting situation with her Nardo: Orendt had developed a throat infection in the course of the day, so he sang the recits while his arias and his part in the ensembles were taken from the dress circle side of stage by Gavan Ring. He deserved the biggest applause for his superb élan in the fizziest number with its energetic violin titters, Nardo’s Act 1 railing against woman transposed to try and give extra focus to an abbreviated Act 3.Mozart’s most prophetically inventive music goes, as it should, to the predicament of the heroine and the lover who tried to kill her in a fit of jealousy – a pre-action event spelled out during the overture where we seem to be presented with the scenario that Strauss and Hofmannsthal’s Octavian might have stabbed his Marschallin during their night of passion and now needs to get the hell out of there. Only this young blade really is not a mezzo in disguise but a handsome youth, tenor Joel Prieto, who sings prettily but with not quite enough of the backbone occasionally needed for Count Belfiore’s more wayward expressions.The countess-as-garden-girl who can’t help loving her assailant is taken with plenty of character and stylistic beauty by the very classy Christiane Karg, Aricie in Glyndebourne’s revelatory Rameau – oh, for more of that – last year. You can really hear the dividends of intensive work between singer, conductor and orchestra at Glyndebourne pay off in her sotto voce cavatina of despair with muted strings There’s splendid work here, as throughout, from the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment reunited with Ticciati, but it’s not enough, and the way Don Anchise draws our attention to the lovely scoring for flute and oboes in his first aria leaves you expecting much more instrumental felicity than Mozart delivers. Still, the final duet when Violante and Belfiore re-commit brings the highest Mozartian standards all round. If only the 18-year-old composer had more to ask in that league throughout.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-finta-giardiniera-glyndebourne,3
413,"Ariadne auf Naxos, Royal Opera",Ariadne auf Naxos,Royal Opera,2014-06-26,David Nice,"Can it really be 12 years since Antonio Pappano inaugurated his transformative era as the Royal Opera’s Music Director conducting Strauss’s Ariadne auf Naxos? Christof Loy’s production seemed so radical at the time. We were put off our guard by seeing opera stars in the backstage Prologue preparing for an 18th century opera seria – to be famously interrupted by common or garden song and dance in poet-librettist Hofmannsthal's ingenious misalliance – but what we actually got in the ""performance"" was a modern Ariadne slumped on a dressing table in a hotel room the walls of which only suggested a desert island, peopled by female staff and jack-the-lad troupers.It felt true and poignant and innovative then. That it doesn’t this time around is largely due to Karita Mattila's Ariadne. She gives her passionate all, in great if sometimes gauzy gusts of prima donna opulence; but I didn’t believe in her suffering as the poor woman who's been deserted by her lover and longs for death. If anything, she more resembles an especially crazed Salome ranting over the head of John the Baptist. This is Ariadne as sacred monster, not the kind of real human being we could believe in when Petra Lang and above all Anne Schwanewilms sang in the same production.Mattila's Ariadne might as well be stuck in front of a cave on a hokum desert-island set. It’s a bad start for an opera proper where Ariadne has not just one lament in the vein of Monteverdi’s prototype, but two big arias one after the other. How the first-night audience coughed and fidgeted through them. True, the commedia dell’arte troupe led by “the fickle Zerbinetta” make their interjections early on and take over for an extended intermezzo but that, too, which seemed so pointedly anarchic first time round, now feels like an aimless mess, and even Harlequin's charming little serenade comes across as unduly aggressive from Markus Werba, maybe in line with the interpretation..Jane Archibald (pictured right), the latest contender for the coloratura crown in Zerbinetta's ne plus ultra sermon of easy loving, is characterful but not always very clear toned, accurate but never as brilliant up top as one of the two true stars of the evening’s longer half for me, Russian light soprano Sofia Fomina. Her personality in the Greek-chorus nymphs’ trio is matched by the luxury casting of Karen Cargill, a truly great mezzo and, or so Robin Ticciati told me he hopes, a future Berlioz Dido. With Kiandra Howarth just fine as Echo to their Naiad and Dryad, the Rhinemaidenish passages are the musical highlights of the opera Ariadne auf Naxos this time round.Fortunately there’s also the backstage Prologue, which sparkles, seethes and coruscates under Pappano’s now expert guidance. Solo string detail is exceptional, especially from the principal viola, while lower colours inform the slightly gone-to-seed wisdom of the Music Master (Thomas Allen, razor-sharp as ever despite an early pre-emptive cue) and the despair of his impetuous adolescent protégé the Composer. Ruxandra Donose (pictured below with Allen) is a true mezzo with the necessary ardour for the top notes originally destined for a soprano. Again, like Archibald’s, the voice can be a little under-defined in the middle register, but it’s a committed assumption, its wings clipped only slightly by Pappano’s tendency to press the great hymn to music’s holy art, as he does the climax of the parallel outpouring in the opera proper.Loy’s production doesn’t make much sense there of Bacchus as the transformative new love, much as Roberto Saccà has what it takes for this insanely written and usually thankless part. There’s plenty of bit-part work for the house’s Jette Parker Young Artists, with Jihoon Kim making his mark as an impudent lackey, and Ed Lyon camps it up as the character-tenor Dancing Master, nicely abetted by Pappano in a solemn reminder to the Composer of how greater masters than him have had to swallow their pride before first nights.Unfortunately his smug declarations that there are passages in the young chap’s work which will be perilously boring come true owing to uncertain characterization; the singing and playing just aren’t enough on this occasion. I’m in a minority here, but I found much greater truth and pathos in the Blitz-time country house hospital meeting of Soile Isokoski’s stricken patient Ariadne and Sergey Skorokhodov’s airman Bacchus at Glyndebourne. But at least Director of Opera Kasper Holten has voted confidence in that fascinating experiment’s director, Katharina Thoma, by inviting her to direct Un ballo in maschera next Royal Opera season. The Loy era, a Tristan revival next season apart, may be over, though this production is a reminder of the risk Pappano took all those years ago. It's just a shame that this Ariadne doesn't quite make the triple Covent Garden whammy after an ideally cast Elektra and Die Frau ohne Schatten to do Strauss anniversary year fullest justice. MORE RICHARD STRAUSS ON THEARTSDESKDer Rosenkavalier, Royal Opera (2009).

414,"Tosca, Longborough Festival",Tosca,Longborough Festival,2014-06-25,stephen Walsh,"For Longborough to open their new season with Tosca after last summer’s triumphant Wagner is to invoke Joseph Kerman’s famous diatribe against Puccini’s “shabby little shocker” in his fifties book Opera as Drama. Kerman used Wagner’s theories to pick holes in Puccini’s at times flagrant theatricality: which only goes to show what an untheoretical thing opera can be. Because Tosca is a work that rarely fails in the theatre, even on so apparently unsuitable a stage as that of Longborough’s converted barn, with a cut down orchestra, a barely adequate chorus, and soloists accustomed to projecting across much bigger spaces.Not that Richard Studer’s production was without its first night problems. There were shaky moments in the opening scene in Sant’Andrea, not helped by a perilous-looking floor in the form of a heavily raked grill, and updated costumes that presented Tosca and Cavaradossi as a pair of shapeless forty-somethings. Puccini, interestingly, survives reduced orchestration less well than Wagner, perhaps because there is less to spare. And certainly Tosca can’t be doing with a chorus of seven or eight in the offstage cantata of Act 2, or with a children’s choir of ten in the first act, nicely though they may (and do) sing. This is music that needs a quality of attack to go with its heady dramatic aura of brutal and unrestrained violence. It’s the operatic reverse of a limp handshake.It’s to Studer’s credit, though, that the production weathers these troubles, perhaps not entirely in the first act, but emphatically in the second, as rivetingly directed and sung as I can remember. Well, it’s also musically the strongest act and the fastest moving. Studer, who is his own designer, gets the Palazzo Farnese atmosphere – that characteristic blend of the bon vivant and the psychopath that links Scarpia to Mussolini – with the simplest means: no clutter, no interfering concepts. In the first act a few columns and a crucifix locate us in church; in the third, a single dead tree reminds us, perversely, that Cavaradossi will not hang but will, nevertheless, perish. This is exemplary stage management, which spreads also to the cast, making them the centre of attention and ensuring that the drama is conveyed through their singing and acting.They don’t betray this trust. Lee Bisset (pictured right with Adriano Graziani) may not have the vocal grandeur of the greatest Toscas, but she uses what she has with real brilliance, and with a musical intelligence that is reflected in her facial as much as in her vocal expression. She is, to the life, the frail female driven to heroism by a potent mixture of passion and piety. Opposite her, Adriano Graziani is a stylish, alert Cavaradossi, trying hard to look like an artist (in shirt and braces) rather than an Italian tenor, still slightly underpowered in his “Vittoria”, but touching and eloquent elsewhere.Simon Thorpe is a youngish Scarpia, perhaps too prone to outbursts of sexual frustration for a successful police chief, but forceful of voice and presence. His minor victims, the agent Spoletta (Richard Roberts), and the escaped political, Angelotti (Nicolas Legoux), tremble before him – as Tosca puts it over his corpse – very convincingly. Wyn Pencarreg is a nice, bumbling Sacristan, the work’s sole representative of the common man, and musically important too in his duet-asides with Cavaradossi.Jonathan Lyness, whom I heard two weeks ago conducting an excellent chamber Don Pasquale in a Herefordshire barn (for Opera Projects), switches easily to this bigger canvas. This is a Tosca as dramatic as it must be and as well-scaled. It only needs a touch more warmth and precision at exposed moments to clinch a notable production.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/tosca-longborough-festival,3
415,"Don Quichotte, Grange Park Opera",Don Quichotte,Grange Park Opera,2014-06-24,Sebastian Scotney,"Grange Park Opera has a strong penchant for French repertoire, and has been valiant, consistent and highly imaginative in presenting it ever since 1998, when Wasfi Kani and Michael Moody first started inviting opera-goers to the unique setting of a Greek revival house in the Hampshire countryside. This year's production  of Massenet's 1909 Don Quichotte is the eighth French work which the company has produced. Samson et Dalila next year will be the ninth.Stagings of Don Quichotte in the UK are rare indeed, the last one of significance probably having been English National Opera's in 1994, with Richard Van Allan playing the title role. It does have some odds stacked against it: the three main protagonists are lower voices and it is an opera which dwells on deeply unsexy subjects like honour, ageing, death. However, this production, designed and directed by Charles Edwards certainly achieves one thing: it will have proved harsher critics of the work – Leonard Gilman's page of invective about the Met's 1926 production is well worth reading, mainly for entertainment value - very wrong. This production puts the case well that Don Quichotte is a work of variety, poignancy and emotional depth, and one which deserves to be seen and heard more.Don Quichotte was not Massenet's last opera – there were three more after it – but it is nevertheless a work he was involved in completing as he was writing his memoirs. There are moments, brought out perhaps too obviously with a slightly tongue-in cheek subplot in this production, where he is clearly penning his own valediction. Massenet has his protagonist singing a prayer in Act 3 in which he asks the Lord to receive his soul, and reflects on his life and prepares for death at the end of Act 5. These were moments to which the BBC Concert Orchestra conducted by Renato Balsadonna – normally to be found as chorus director at the Royal Opera House – brought genuine emotion and beautiful shape. They felt like the emotional heart of the work, and I had the palpable sense of an audience completely spellbound.Some commentators have been particularly irritated by the windmill scene at the end of Act 2, in which a puppet-head representing Stravinsky is brought on to represent the threat to Massenet's values of modernity in music. I found it highly effective as a way to draw attention to the vividness of Massenet's take on post-Salome grand guignol.The production uses the small stage to great effect. Gabrielle Dalton's belle epoque costumes bring style and beauty to the enterprise. Paul Keogan's lighting desiign is highly imaginative in the way it differentiates parts of the split stage, brilliant in the way it calibrates mood-shifts, and felt additive throughout.Clive Bayley's characterization of the knight of the woeful countenance (pictured above) was superbly varied. Unlike Richard Van Allan who may have left it until too late to perform the role, Bayley has laid down a strong marker that he owns it. Mezzo-soprano Sara Fulgoni (pictured below) is a Grange Park stalwart; she was superb, for example, as Brangaene in Tristan in 2011. She played Dulcinée very convincingly as Carmen with more miles on the clock. Her use of vibrato can be excessive. A revelation, and perhaps the singer whose cause will have been most advanced by this production, is the Sancho Panza of David Stout. He was authoritative, quick-witted, dramatically engaging and powerful, and vocally very strong throughout.In the pit, Renato Balsadonna, in his first production at Grange Park Opera, was able to give real air and spaciousness to the more poignant moments of the score, without there ever being any question of doubt or hesitation or discrepancy between chorus, soloists and orchestra. The solo cello episode before the last act was brought out beautifuully and pricipal oboe, flute and clarinet took every one of their solo moments with distinction. Balsadonna's superb authority with the fast-moving chorus parts was very much in evidence.Grange Park is a place which the word ""destination"" (when used as an adjective) was made to describe. It is a magical place, and the level of thought and attention to detail is inspiring. This thought-provoking and visually clever and attractive production is a milestone for the Grange Park company – it will be the first recording which the BBC have done at Grange Park. The broadcaster will record the final performance of the run on 9 July for future transmission on Radio 3.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/don-quichotte-grange-park-opera,4
416,"The Cunning Little Vixen, Garsington Opera",The Cunning Little Vixen,Garsington Opera,2014-06-23,David Nice,"Rolling hills with beech-rich woods sloping upwards from a wide valley: the Wormsley Estate has more than a little in common with glorious Hukvaldy in Moravia, where Janáček was born and ended his life, and where in old age he once again saw ""his"" vixen. With an admirable independence of mind that seriously underrated director Daniel Slater has gone against the grain inside the fabulous pavilion where Garsington’s operas now resound. Instead of extending the natural scene, Robert Innes Hopkins’s simple but original designs paper the walls of the inn where most of the action takes place with leaf patterns, opening out to laddered, stylised forest, and Slater sheds animal cutesiness in favour of the human predicament.Our vixen is a foxy and enigmatic young woman who comes and sits at one of the bar-room tables. Is the protagonist Forester whose dream ends the opera attracted to her animal nature? Is there love at stake? It’s kept vague, but the bigger picture is a fine clarification of an issue Janáček, with typical whimsicality, introduces at rather a late stage in the drama – Vixen Sharpears’ identification, in the minds of three disillusioned older men, with the adored Terynka who ends up getting a fox muff from the poacher Harašta. The scene where Priest, Schoolmaster and Forester slide around a winter landscape in hapless pursuit of the ideal usually comes across as an incoherent mess but thanks to the way it's played, with the vixen coolly amused by the follies of the opposite sex, it works impressively. It also makes a convincing end for a first half which, for once, comes to a halt at the right place (rather than the vixen’s wedding, which leaves less than half an hour of drama after supper, as at Glyndebourne).All focus, then, is on the vixen and her one-time captor. Gone are the dragonfly ballets and the visual equivalents of the music’s forest murmurs, which leaves the stage a bit empty at the beginning and end, depending very much on whether the two leads and their dance doubles can carry it. Claire Booth is a riveting revelation in the title role, her spirited Czech inflections ringing out at every turn. We can’t take our eyes off her captivating personage from the minute she sits down wistfully in the first scene. As she explodes into life, her tongue-in-cheek feminism goes vivaciously hand in glove with killer instincts.The victory over rampant rooster and his knitting harem of hens (pictured above) has all the comedy it needs, but rightly nature raw in tooth and claw turns nasty when Sharpears sets about Harašta before he shoots her (Booth with Joshua Bloom's Harašta pictured below), a bloodying well in tune with the sexual ferment of Slater’s male-female confrontations. That only underlines the tenderness of the big love scene with Fox Golden Mane (Victoria Simmonds, as compellingly man-like as the other cross-dressing animal roles in Hopkins’s superlative costume designs), the vulnerability of Booth’s vixen in love as touching as it should be. The offspring in woolly hats, barkers’ dozen perhaps, are enchanting, but it’s only in the forest nuptials that Slater allows the stage to be anything like as busy as Melly Still’s rather cluttered Glyndebourne vision.Parallel to the happy natural love story are the dream pas de deux of a superb dance duo, Chiara Vinci and Jamie Higgins (pictured below), fluent and sensuous in Maxine Braham’s spare but lovely choreography. A handful of the interludes are slightly mistimed, like the climax of the vixen’s turning into a young woman, and the final scene doesn’t quite come off, though again the restraint is admirable.The problem here is that the stalwart Grant Doyle is perhaps too young and not charismatic enough to convince us of the wisdom of older age which we need to see in the Forester’s enlightenment, his understanding of the natural order of things. The Forester’s cronies, Henry Waddington’s Priest and Timothy Robinson’s Schoolmaster, are too much between two ages to suggest the disillusioned sense of having missed any chance at happiness. And this, after all, was old man Janáček’s most important thrust.All three sing well, but need to realize that you don’t have to force your projection in this admirable acoustic, where the voices can always be heard over the largest orchestra yet engaged at Garsington. Draw them in rather than push out could be the lesson here. The playing under Garry Walker’s expert thrust is mostly first-rate, and I don’t suppose the premature horn entry or later the vanishing trumpet which nearly sabotaged the endgame will happen in future performances. That penetrating oboe sound rising from the shallow pit turned out to be none other than the superb Melinda Maxwell’s, and the limited number of strings makes for mostly pellucid textures with woodwind nature-noises clearer than I’ve ever heard them.Admirable, too, is Walker’s drive with the short-lived human ecstasy burst of the second-act scene change between inn and forest landscape, one of the great melodies Janáček presents and then discards. Funny people, those Garsington punters: I could end with a catalogue of weird remarks about lack of tunes, incomprehensibility and so on as we exited. But since I was treading air through the beautiful, lantern-lit sweep of landscape, I’ll leave you with my own thoughts of country-house opera done at a very high level indeed.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/cunning-little-vixen-garsington-opera,4
417,"Glyndebourne: the Untold History, BBC Four",Glyndebourne: the Untold History,BBC Four,2014-06-23,Adam Sweeting,"Celebrating the 80th anniversary of opera at Glyndebourne, this 90-minute documentary was fascinating when it delved into the house's history, but started to lose its bearings when it came back to the present day and dwelt at laborious length over this season's new production of Richard Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier. It was as if nobody could decide what sort of film to make, so they made two and cut chunks of them together.What might be called the ""origin story"" of this most resplendently rural of opera houses took us back to the post-World War One era, when decorated Army captain and Wagner enthusiast John Christie inherited the Glyndebourne estate and began staging informal operas. He married glamorous Canadian soprano Audrey Mildmay, and after they'd made a tour of Continental opera houses, Christie dedicated himself to bringing European-style opera to England. From Germany he recruited conductor Fritz Busch, general manager Rudolf Bing and director Carl Ebert, who'd all fallen foul of the Nazi regime, and between them they devised a dramatically intense performing style (there was some great vintage film of Ebert acting out movements and dance steps for the singers). It was unveiled at the inaugural Glyndebourne Festival in 1934 (old Glyndebourne, below).Humphrey Burton, whose own films about Glyndebourne were among a cornucopia of archive footage assembled here, observed that it ""created truly professional opera in this country"", and through the clips from 40 or 50 years ago you felt a sense of boundaries being pushed and new standards being set. For some, Glyndebourne will always be pigeonholed as a bucolic toffs' playground in idyllic South Downs countryside (it might have been designed to quash any notions about ""opera for the masses""), but several interviewees described how having the company sequestered in leafy solitude builds a spirit of intense closeness and collaboration (John Christie, below).After World War Two, the house's fortunes ebbed and flowed, but it was John Christie's financially savvy son George who launched Glyndebourne into a brighter, more secure future by masterminding the building of a brand new auditorium, a masterly piece of design which could accommodate 1,200 people. Today it's Gus who's carrying on the Christie dynasty, with his wife Danielle De Niese playing the ebullient châtelaine.The story of Glyndebourne is a rich and rewarding fable in itself, and would have made a perfect hour-long film - perhaps even a 90 minute one. The film-makers must have had enough material for a separate feature about the new Rosenkavalier, but splicing it into the historical account never felt comfortable. It was as if it was saying ""we've shown you Glyndebourne's peerless pedigree, now can we sell you this shiny new opera?"" (below, Tara Erraught as Octavian with Kate Royal as the Marschallin in Der Rosenkavalier).Not that there wasn't some illuminating discussion from assorted participants and critics (including theartsdesk's David Nice) about the staging and the musical and dramatic complexities Strauss and librettist Hugo von Hofmannsthal had built into the piece, and we had a pocket biography of Strauss for good measure. But with all this going on, it was beyond superfluous to include touristic interviews with cast members such as Tara Erraught and Teodora Gheorghiu, eulogising the wonders of the east Sussex countryside during lambing season. When the cameras took off on a behind-the-scenes exploration of Glyndebourne's army of set builders and costume designers, it began to feel as if we'd strayed into of those documentaries about Luton airport or traffic wardens. I reckon that tantalising 90-minute slot was a mixed blessing.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/glyndebourne-untold-history-bbc-four,3
418,"Crowd Out/Death Actually, Spitalfields Music Summer Festival",Crowd Out/Death Actually,Spitalfields Music Summer Festival,2014-06-22,David Nice,"“I feel so alone I could cry”. As the keynote of Adam Smallbone’s Passion in the breathtaking third series of Rev, that unspoken sentiment provided a passacaglia bass line to the failure of St Saviour’s. Made explicit In the mouths of possibly 600 Londoners just around the corner from that noble edifice, in reality the relatively thriving St Leonard’s Shoreditch, it felt paradoxically uplifting and – I feel myself sucked in to use the word now that I'm signed up to Spitalfields hip – empowering.Arnold Circus, the heart of London’s first major housing project now graced by beautiful planting, a ping-pong table and - crucially for the performance - a bandstand in the middle (pictured below with Simon Halsey conducting on the day by James Berry), was the echoing amphitheatre for Pulitzer Prize-winning, New York Bang on a Can composer David Lang’s Crowd Out. Musically co-ordinated by choral supremo Simon Halsey and directed by Thomas Guthrie - more, much more, on him anon - It had two performances yesterday a week after Berlin threw down the gauntlet alongside Simon Rattle conducting Carmina Burana outside the Philharmonie. Crowd Out is the quintessence of what the all-inclusive Spitalfields Music Summer Festival has become all about, and it was moving to tears.Can I be so sentimental? Yes, because here really were people of all ages, of all religions and none, talking, shouting and singing in a meticulously orchestrated piece of street theatre. It could only have led Rev Smallbone to conclude that, dwindling as the Anglican community no doubt is, the Shoreditch/Spitalfields model of secular communion is a utopian one, the kind of heaven on earth Mozart's Sarastro anticipated. A glorious Midsummer day no doubt helped. The high London plane trees added their rustling notes in the cooling winds, dogs barked, tots on bystanders’ shoulders joined in shouting “HA!” on cue, everybody smiled non-stop or gaped in wonder.There was a point to all this. Lang, intending 1000 performers but hoping the number will go up to 50,000 to emulate the football stadium songs which were one inspiration, has taken a collection of first-person comments he found on the internet, more about isolation than joining in, and turned them into paradox in the mouths of hundreds. Four “strands” eventually converged on the bandstand from all sides of the Circus, first in normal voices, then antiphonally responding to their megaphoning leaders, taking on staggered melodic phrases set to the words “I feel like rushing into tears”, later adding four more complex patterns. “It ought to end in melody”, said a friend – one oceanic single note perhaps – but that wasn’t the message. We begin alone, we become part of a community, we melt into aloneness again.Which brings us to the dread word “death”. It's been much on the minds of those of us absorbed in Poulenc's Dialogues des Carmélites over the past two months – the fear thereof, the possibility of grace. Nothing could have felt more alive than the streets of Spitalfields on the best Midsummer afternoon. And yet that party I stumbled across in one of the historic streets, peopled among others by a splendidly-attired cast of The Wizard of Oz – prize of course to the Tin Man - turned out to be a memorial to a typical denizen, the artist and menagerie-keeper Polly Hope, who died six months ago. Read all about her in Spitalfields Life, the blog by an anonymous “Gentle Author”, which spawned a beautifully produced book and continues with its daily entries, intentionally for the next 10 years. Down at a revelatory venue, Toynbee Studios, another birthplace of social engineering, Bjarte Eike and his Barokksolistene were to wind up a three-part meditation on death with an “Alehouse Wake” (Eike pictured at the ""wake"" with colleague. Milos Valent. All Death Actually images by Simon Wall)I’d not had the chance to experience one of Eike’s celebrated Alehouse raves when I heard him and his phenomenal team as the resident orchestra for Handel's Alcina in Oslo (and it turns out its brilliant star, American soprano Nicole Heaston, soon to be seen in Glyndebourne's La finta giardiniera, was sitting behind me last night). They were the reason I signed up for this final flourish of the Festival. But it was much more than a showcase for the livest-wire fiddling in the business. Renaissance man Tom Guthrie had put together a theatrical triple bill embracing a Schubert song-cycle and Bach motets done at the highest level, all death-devoted.That dread word, “Tod”, only emerges in the 16th song of Die schöne Müllerin (The Fair Maid of the Mill), and it fairly made the spine tingle on its first appearance. But all was clearly not well from the start with tenor Robert Murray’s suitor – a manic-depressive, at least, stricken by anxiety even at his happiest. The spookiness was heightened by the puppet Murray manipulated (both pictured), more a Doppelgänger than a companion. Given a singer’s inevitably limited skill in puppetry, the figure probably moved as well as it could, though I’ve seen more lifelike headtilts and questioning looks. The main thing was that we visualized the story, the unseen girl and especially the intrusion of the huntsman on the scene as puppet and singer stared, stricken, outwards and upwards.The real coup was to add to Murray’s infinitely expressive voice, running from slivers of introspection to a heroic vein few English choral-scholar tenors can match, an arrangement of Schubert’s piano part for two guitars, percussion and four strings. How the ensemble underlined the edge of Schubert’s dance tunes, though the majority of the songs were more selectively scored, the limelight belonging to consummate guitarist John Löfving, sometimes in haunting duet with Johannes Lundberg’s jazz/classical double bass pizzicato. The doomed miller-boy's final merge with the ever-present stream floated with supernatural beauty. The performing version, apparently made by Guthrie, who else, could not have been more sensitively or skilfully done.It’s a golden age for young British tenors, and we heard another of astonishing musicality in the Bach, Samuel Boden. Nothing could have been more pain-easing than his part in the fugue which relieves the dark intensity of Jesu, meine Freude. The eight-part antiphonies of Komm, Jesu, komm pinged off the Toynbee wood and plaster in the hands of the best singers in the business. On the top lines were contrasting sopranos Gillian Keith and Elin Manahan Thomas, while the basses blended with impressive restraint.Did the movement add anything, though? Not for me: the sub-Peter Sellars semaphoring and the seemingly random rushing about brought none of the images conjured by the Schubert, and spotlighting seemed fairly arbitrary, too: there was no good reason I could see why some of the singers were in the dark. Guthrie is a singular vocalist, too, but there remained just a degree of self-consciousness in what he did, which was further exposed by his fellow musicians in the wake. On this evidence his real talents are as an arranger and an animateur, a bringer-together of superb artists in a clever context.His ubiquity in the Alehouse was good enough, though, not to curb our enthusiasm. We’d been invited to take our drinks and move around, but a tart sitter told us to go to the back of the hall if we wanted to jig about. I invited her to stand, but in the end we sat, and wished there were space to dance. The format offers plenty of freedom but has a superbly orchestrated framework guided by the ever-likeable Eike. Among the many improvised touches, those of his wacky colleague Milos Valent were surreally funny.The star turn, apart from Eike's ineffable and never attention seeking violinistic wizardry, was Steve Player (pictured). He did a kind of hybrid routine to Fredrik Bock’s brilliant flamenco guitar, Iberiana laced into baroque fantasia – “Juan Kelly”, quipped my friend – and later sang and danced, with the kind of liberating hand movements which remind us there's more to Irish folk choreography than arms-straight Riverdance, to the tune of blind Irish tippler harpist, composer and singer Turlogh O'Carolan.Did the Purcell-pop crossover work? Absolutely, because of the joy and humour with which it was done. We need much more of the Barokksolistene in this country, and there was just a hint that Spitalfields may in future be the place to hear them at greater length. Just one thing - after the wild multicultiness of Shout Out, it was all exclusively northern European blokey: are you telling me there aren't any equally vibrant women fiddlers around to leaven the tasty pudding?Next page: two short films of the Crowd Out and Alehouse experiencesHenrique Paiva's short takes on the Crowd Out event An Alehouse trailer from Barokksolistene",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/crowd-outdeath-actually-spitalfields-music-summer-festival,4
419,"The Fall of the House of Usher, Welsh National Opera",The Fall of the House of Usher,Welsh National Opera,2014-06-21,stephen Walsh,"The Fall of the House of Usher is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s mistier tales, and although it has been turned into opera a few times, there are obvious difficulties. Debussy struggled for a decade to materialise a drama out of its haunting, neurotic atmosphere, and in the end failed, I would argue, because he was unable to distance himself enough from the central characters to construct a stage action about them. He sketched, though, a good deal of fascinating music, and out of this material the musicologist Robert Orledge has put together a performable work that, if not entirely convincing as narrative, is utterly gripping as musical psycho-drama. Premiered at the Bregenz Festival in 2007, it reached Britain last week in a new production by David Pountney; I caught up with it on tour at the Birmingham Hippodrome.At the heart of Poe’s short story (a mere sixteen or so pages) is the tortured figure of Roderick Usher, the latest, and last, scion of an ancient, inbred family now in catastrophic decline. Over-cultivated and clinically hyper-sensitive, Roderick is passionately in love with his cataleptic twin sister Madeline, who flits through the tale like a distant ghost and gets buried alive (like many Poe heroes: there was catalepsy in his own family). She rises from the grave, clanking and bloodstained, crushes her brother to death, and brings the house crashing down, both literally and metaphorically, on top of them both.Pountney’s staging is superb, with brilliant use of film projectionThe story, such as it is, is narrated by an old school friend of Roderick’s, who visits at his urgent request. Much of it is description; there’s little dialogue and no other characters, apart from a sinister family doctor whom the friend meets on the stairs, and who seems to hint at unspecified evil goings-on. Debussy, in his completed libretto, enlarged this character and made him an agent of the collapse, himself in love with Madeline and her would-be murderer.But the music remained as fragments, sometimes composed out, often in shorthand, in Debussy’s minute, spiderish notation, the harmony frequently unclear, in an idiom that he was pushing towards new horizons as intriguing as those in Jeux and the late piano works. It has to be said that, whatever one may feel about this kind of creative musicology, as Orledge calls it, he has done a remarkable job in working the Usher-like debris into an integrated score that mostly sounds wonderfully like refined late Debussy. Much of the power of what this great composer must have been striving for comes across, with the odd crudity of sound, but also a lot that is rich, beautiful and highly individual. It leaves one wondering what more he might have achieved if he had outlived the war in 1918.Pountney’s and designer Niki Turner's staging is superb, with brilliant use of film projection (David Haneke) to create the unstable environment of Roderick’s mind and the dark, intense atmosphere of his house and its surroundings. Also very skilful is the portraiture: Roderick as a cross between Poe himself and some kind of dithering, neurotic Bunthorne, wonderfully well sung in true French style by Robert Hayward (pictured right); the crazed doctor, red hair on end like diabolical horns (Mark Le Brocq, also excellent); and the nameless friend, raincoated and “normal”, a solid performance by William Dazeley. Madeline looms large at the end (literally, on film), but has little to do musically. Anna Gorbachyova sings her song about “la plus verte de nos allées” very prettily. Lawrence Foster conducts an intense, finely sustained reading with much exquisite orchestral playing.This production (along with a good deal else) has been made possible by a fat donation from the Getty family, with the little quid pro quo of an opera by the composer member of that family, Gordon Getty, of the same Poe tale. Getty’s Usher House, paired here with the Debussy, is perhaps a small price to pay for so lavish a hand-out (£1.2 million), though there will be understandable grumblings in the steerage section of under-played composers who can’t wield such bounty.The music is anecdotal: paste jewels strung on a loose thread of vocal recitativeWas it worth it? Musically doubtful. Getty’s own libretto has the interest, if not the appeal, that it concretises much that is no more than hinted in Poe: the old school friends, the family history, the archives, the astrology: everything is spelt out as in some ghastly symbolist soap opera. Even the friend gets a name: Eddie (no, really: guess who). And the music is anecdotal in the same way: bits and pieces, paste jewels strung on a loose thread of vocal recitative. Orledge might be commissioned to fill it out a little. But he has better things to do.Pountney nevertheless did it proud, with still more spectacular mobile film settings (from Penrhyn Castle, North Wales), and a well-prepared, not at all skimped, musical performance. Benjamin Bevan is a vague, professorial Usher, with Jason Bridges as Poe himself, Kevin Short as the mysterious Doctor Primus, a sort of Makropulos Magus figure with bushy white Einsteinian hair, and Gorbachyova again as the frail Madeline. Excellent playing under Foster. But it’s hard to wish for their labours to be rewarded with repeat performances.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/fall-house-usher-welsh-national-opera,4
420,"Manon Lescaut, Royal Opera",Manon Lescaut,Royal Opera,2014-06-18,David Nice,"Puccini’s racy first masterpiece, like its successor La bohème, should feel like an opera of two halves – the first full of youthful exuberance, the second darker and ultimately tragic. The contrast here, alas, was between vivacious performers and a sombre, sometimes confused updating by Jonathan Kent which too often dwarfed or zapped their better efforts.On the minus side, any contemporary rendering of a slight-ish melodrama adapted from Abbé Prévost’s 1731 novel goes against the grain of the depicted attempts to send our pleasure-loving young heroine first into a convent and then, for prostitution, into exile, though I suppose Eastern European trafficking could work. A plus might be pithier correspondences of this sad tale about a girl destroyed by consumerism with Turnage’s Anna Nicole, due to make a welcome return to the Royal Opera next season (and the irony of sponsorship here by Rolex, the ultimate purveyor of must-have-but-don't-need luxury, isn't lost). In the hands of that effective show’s director, Richard Jones, this modern-dress take could have worked better. Unfortunately Kent and his designer, Paul Brown, whose elaborate spinning sarcophagus for Don Giovanni and polystylistic Rameau just about came off on the smaller stage at Glyndebourne, give little sense of place or stage topography.Why the small modern flats or hotel rooms above the casino of Act One (the meeting of Manon and Des Grieux pictured right), not to mention the wobbly lamp-post, or the lighting rig that descends in Act Three, with some unclear link to the filming before an invited audience of the sex-workers’ shipping off across the Atlantic - an action feebly represented by a rip through a giant fashion poster? The idea of Manon’s capitulation to sleazy banker Geronte’s mansion, where she’s asked to participate in another media event, a sex show for his dirty old men friends, is clearer, but manages to make even the gorgeous Kristine Opolais grotesque in an ageing China Blue wig, pink fluffy dress and high schoolgirl socks (pictured below straddling Maurizio Moraro's Geronte) – maybe part of the point, but while it’s good not to have the clichés of wink-wink rococo powder and paint, this overlards the woman-as-object theme: Geronte surely wants to keep the girl glamorous and for himself alone. It most goes against the grain that the dramatic intelligence of Opolais and Jonas Kaufmann is used to render their passionate young lovers very often as depressed blank slates, starting with a sombre stage picture to contradict the brilliant prelude and especially hard on traumatised Manon. Puccini’s music, especially in the focused vitality of Pappano and a Royal Opera orchestra on superb form yet again, never stays still and, in its youthful impetuousness, rarely gives time for the kind of inscaping which might have worked in a straight play. Vocally, this usually brilliant pair sometimes sounds a bit lost in various spots around the gigantic set, though both singers are absolutely up to the considerable demands of their taxing roles.Kaufmann starts, as usual, with darker tone than we might expect from a sunshine-and-roses Italian tenor – his lighter confrere Edmondo, more than promisingly sung by Benjamin Hulett, is better suited to the studentish pranks of the first scene – and then gets into gear, but with rather too many Italianate sobs between phrases. Though one size lighter than a Del Monaco or a Corelli, he still pulls the stops out for Des Grieux’s increasing despair, and ignites the climactic third act.Opolais has fewer opportunities for the vocal colour and inflection she does so well, and the very top of the voice doesn’t always bloom as I’ve heard it, but she is absolutely Kaufmann’s and Pappano’s equal in the love-hungry thrust of the big Act Two duet, and nails, Scotto-like, all but the very last phrase of the big solo alone, lost and abandoned midway up the stage on the desert highway (pictured below right). How good it is, too, to believe instantly when the chorus sing about a ""beautiful young girl"" or Lescaut of a ""handsome young man"". And both are stage naturals on whom all eyes are fixed.Even the baritone in this opera is very much a second fiddle, though Christopher Maltman puts plenty of energy into Manon’s medallion-man brother, and there’s an admirably understated, vocally disciplined Geronte from Maurizio Muraro. The only weak turn among the bit parts is Jette Parker Young Artist Nadezhda Karyazina, her too-fast vibrato working against the neoclassical line as a musician required to fondle and be fondled by Manon in a kind of titillating lesbian scene for the elderly.Come the curtain-call, there were enthusiastic cheers for the golden central couple, which seems fair – hard as it may have been to care much for Manon’s pointless death less than a week after witnessing the meaningful grace that descends on Poulenc’s Carmelites -  and for Pappano, no qualification needed, but some fierce booing for Kent and his team. Certainly the show doesn’t merit that, but it’s no great addition to the Royal Opera repertoire either. Close-ups in the livescreening should help to pull it all more into focus.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/manon-lescaut-royal-opera,3
421,"The Pearl Fishers, English National Opera",The Pearl Fishers,English National Opera,2014-06-17,Kimon Daltas,"Before curtain-up on the opening night of this revival of Penny Woolcock’s production of The Pearl Fishers, ENO's head of casting arrived on stage with a microphone. No doubt delightful company in person, he was an unwelcome sight here. Sophie Bevan had a stomach bug, he explained – the disappointment was palpable. But she'd be bravely singing anyway – grateful applause broke out. In the end, our goodwill was not called upon in the least, since Bevan's voice in her debut as Leïla was as strong and agile as ever.As the overture plays this production offers its most visually arresting moment, with a shimmering blue gauze giving an underwater feel and divers on wires plunging from above, their movements followed by digitally projected bubbles. This combination of technology, clever lighting and good old-fashioned stagecraft creates another stunning effect at the end of Act II as a billowing black satin sea merges with projected waves to engulf the stage. Hat tips to Dick Bird (set designer), Jen Schriever (lighting) and video design from 59 Productions. The first act’s rickety shanty-town set is enjoyably detailed and effective in placing the action on different levels, creating striking tableaux vivants in combination with Kevin Pollard’s colourful costume designs on the ragtag army of chorus and actors. The chorus is frequently called upon in this opera, and ENO’s stalwarts do a fine job. The action takes place not in ancient Ceylon, but in modern day Sri Lanka, as signposted by a looming billboard, corrugated tin roofs and oil drum floats. The point is a subtle one – that impoverished people still produce luxury goods today – and it’s in the background rather than laboured.None of this, unfortunately, saves the piece itself from being implausible, especially at its denouement – even for champion disbelief-suspending opera audiences. But it is a tighter and more dramatically engaging performance than in its previous outing in 2010, and Woolcock's production rattles along nicely, despite lacking the set-piece hit parade of Carmen, to which it is inevitably compared. Martin Fitzpatrick’s translation succeeds in maintaining a consistent tone, somewhat olde worlde, but poetic enough to match the music. A bum note is Zurga’s very realistic violence towards Leïla in Act III – its shock value does not feel backed up by a dramatic purpose.John Tessier as Nadir has an attractively bright and reedy voice with excellent diction. One could have certainly cast Nadir as a bigger, brasher tenor, but Tessier held his own, and worked well with Bevan and, crucially, in the famous Act I duet with Zurga (George von Bergen). It wasn’t, perhaps, devastating, but it was certainly lovely. Barnaby Rea’s Nourabad deserves a special mention – it’s not a role with a huge amount to do, but he was close to stealing the show when he got a chance.Conductor Jean-Luc Tingaud, in his ENO debut, lived up to his billing as a specialist in French 19th-century music, squeezing every drop of va-va-voom from this second-tier work.ENO's The Pearl Fishers at the London Coliseum until July 5",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/pearl-fishers-english-national-opera-0,4
422,"Owen Wingrave/ Pavel Haas Quartet, Aldeburgh Festival",Owen Wingrave/ Pavel Haas Quartet,Aldeburgh Festival,2014-06-16,David Nice,"What a red letter day it is when a work you’ve always thought of as problematic seems at last, if only temporarily, to have no kind of fault or flaw. That was the case for me on Sunday afternoon with Britten’s penultimate opera, Owen Wingrave, launching this year’s Aldeburgh Festival with an ideal cast fused as one with the young Britten-Pears Orchestra thanks to the self-evidently intensive collaboration of director Neil Bartlett and conductor Mark Wigglesworth.Britten always demanded the highest standards of artists he could trust (and, as movingly described in a programme article by outgoing festival director Jonathan Reekie, expected as much in terms of active listening from his audience, too, who did the vital work yesterday). But unlike Wagner or Strauss, he did not make the total work of art nearly impossible to realise, and it was achieved in this perfect fusion of talents working at an unusually intense level.The potential pitfalls are many in this, Britten’s second adaptation of a Henry James story (The Turn of the Screw was the first, and has lodged in the core repertoire as Owen Wingrave has not). The source is especially remarkable for its (pre-First World War) stance on militarism and pacifism: Owen, scion of the Wingrave family which has forged its name and patrimony out of sending young men to their deaths in countless wars, proves a higher warrior in saying “no”, but has to be sacrificed to the old mores all the same.By 1969 Britten was ready to make his second shattering musical stance as a conscientious objector, just as he had with words back in 1943, this time in a less unrelenting climate (the first, of course, is one of the 20th century’s true masterpieces, the War Requiem with its fusion of Wilfred Owen settings and the Latin mass for the dead.) By then his music was even tougher, his message uncompromising - and inevitably, given the clash between two types of inflexibility, mostly two-dimensional. He wanted to make a television opera, with all the possibilities of cross-cutting and focus on soliloquies that entailed. The result, filmed in this same Snape Maltings and watched by nearly a quarter of a million viewers, was impressive: no staging I’ve seen until this one has come close.Bartlett handles the spotlights on interior monologues well, even if lighting designer Ian Scott didn’t on Sunday afternoon quite seem to catch every cue (and that’s my only slight cavil about a production which, like Bartlett’s equally singular staging of The Rake’s Progress in the Maltings some years back, makes a virtue of shoestring economy in the designs of Simon Daw and Sue Wilkinson). Wigglesworth conducts a pared-down but never thinner-sounding chamber version by David Matthews – who better, as one of Britten’s best disciples? – with unerring turns of the screw from the first stunning gamelanish tattoo of the prelude through to interludes of surprising if always eerie beauty.The highlight of those, exquisitely played and paced, comes before the disastrous supper party at the Wingraves’ haunted house Paramore, and the denouement is almost blinding in its oddly cathartic magnesium flare. Wigglesworth’s Peter Grimes from Glyndebourne is the deepest I know on disc, Britten’s own Decca version included, and here he puts not a foot wrong. The young Britten-Pears Orchestra musicians, capped by a trumpeter playing a characteristically uncompromising, barbed part as fanfarer, are simply stupendous.As are the fresh graduates in a flawless ensemble. Two have already been seen in their roles - though not by me - in the Guildhall School's evidently less effective production last year. There’s no doubt that they have benefitted from working with their superlative colleagues and mentors: Wagnerian soprano Susan Bullock - newly CBE'd, though she's already ascended the throne as Britten's Gloriana - in the stentorian if under-nuanced role of the dragon aunt, Janis Kelly as the dependent Mrs Julian, Richard Berkeley-Steele as the ranting old-warrior grandfather (the three pictured below with Catherine Backhouse's Kate and James Way's Ballad Singer) and Jonathan Summers in still splendid voice as Owen’s not unsympathetic military tutor Coyle.None of these in any way outshines the newcomers simply because you feel – as in Richard Jones’s Glyndebourne Rosenkavalier – that everyone is absolutely in possession of the meaning and significance of every line as well as the pace and instrumental colours that guide their characters (supertitles might be helpful, though, for the many overlapping ensembles). We know that when Samantha Crawford’s Mrs Coyle, crystalline of tone and diction, dismisses Owen’s love, the entrapped and confused Kate Julian, as “hateful”, her husband is right to retort ""not hateful - only young"", because we see that while at the same time we hear only exceptionally flinty and brilliant tone from the superb mezzo Catherine Backhouse - also much praised by Alexandra Coghlan in her Arts Desk review of the Guildhall production. As Coyle’s young men, Isaiah Bell (Lechmere) and Ross Ramgobin (Owen) offer interpretations which are totally convincing and committed.Indeed, the greatest triumph belongs to Ramgobin’s Wingrave (pictured below with Summers's Coyle), as it should. He shows us an adolescent at breaking point right from the start, which makes Owen’s stands against an unrelenting fury-family and his solo in praise of peace – for the first time in my experience truly tear-jerking and desperately sad as the vision crumbles – all the more impressive. Bartlett’s strong, simple coup is to make the ""ghosts"" who threaten the objector, family portraits of implacable old Wingraves, a movement group of present-day soldiers as threatening bullies. The action proper still belongs to James’s late Victorian/Edwardian era. So when Owen sings that he is ""blockaded by the past"", we see that the future is just as impenetrable: so it goes on and on. The young Wingrave has to die not because he can’t leave behind a tradition, but because the ongoing bestiality behind war’s inflexible demands – astoundingly represented by the soldiers joining the family howls of “How dare you!” - will give him no future.There’s just one hope. As Britten moves from the jabs and glitter of the first act to the timeless ballad of the Wingrave ghosts – the father and his son whom he killed with a blow when the boy refused to fight – hauntingly sung by James Way, Bartlett is alert to the repeating drama of child abuse in Britten’s operas. Which, if we take the testaments of two of Britten’s closest associates, reflected his rape by a master at school. The new dimension of horror is offset by the ballad-singer’s final refusal to join the military salute to the tragedy. There will always be objectors, the production underlines, even if they remain a minority. See this production here or at the Edinburgh Festival; we’ll never get a better.The Saturday afternoon before Sunday’s second operatic performance offered no relaxed prelude to the harrowing. This was a two-concert epic of high Czech drama in two great string quartets apiece by Smetana and Janáček from their young compatriots - or almost, since Slovakia is now another country - in the Pavel Haas Quartet (pictured below). The players have an infallible sense of urgent communication both with each other and to a riveted audience ideal for the near-anarchic disruptions with which Janáček hedges around his late-romantic lyricism, and their earthiness made Smetana’s Bohemian folk dances sounded like something much further to the Slavic east. Underpinned by Peter Jarušek’s robust but never uncultured cello, they pierced collective souls with their resonance from the platform beneath the altar of Aldeburgh Church. The Piper window celebrating Britten's three church parables seemed to glow ever more intensely in sympathy as the afternoon raced on.Perhaps the big surprise was not so much how Smetana’s autobiography paved the way for Janáček’s two quartet narratives – the first based on Tolstoy’s tale of savage jealousy and a brutalized woman, The Kreutzer Sonata, the second on his love for the married Kamila Stösslová – as how absolutely equal the two composers are in their searing.Smetana’s Second Quartet is equally modern in its jagged juxtaposition of physical shock and bittersweet romanticism, as Schoenberg observed. But it was less the penetrating representation of his impending deafness with the tinnitus ring of the first violin towards the end of the First than the whole of that masterpiece’s slow movement which went deeper even than the Janáček companions. Aldeburgh’s intensive programming under the admirable and approachable Pierre-Laurent Aimard is to offer a full rainbow of 20th century and contemporary wonders over the next two weeks, but those who like me only caught some events in the stunning first weekend can feel that their own little slice was food for the imagination to work on for at least as long.Overleaf: two films from Aldeburgh: a short trailer featuring the astounding prelude, and Neil Bartlett's introduction ",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/owen-wingrave-pavel-haas-quartet-aldeburgh-festival,5
423,"San Giovanni Battista/The Cooper, Guildhall Milton Court Theatre",San Giovanni Battista/The Cooper,Guildhall Milton Court Theatre,2014-06-14,alexandra Coghlan,"The practical considerations and limitations of choosing a work for a student showcase can lead to some wonderfully original programming. It doesn’t get much more original than a pairing of Thomas Arne’s ballad opera The Cooper with Stradella’s oratorio San Giovanni Battista, currently being staged by the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.The new Milton Court Theatre is the natural home for something like the Arne – an intimate, close-quarters space where you can see your neighbours’ reactions as well as the action on stage. Which makes it all the more odd that the work’s broad comedy never quite caught the energy of the audience on this, the second night.Frazer B. Scott’s Scottish sot Mr Twigg seized the stage in his brief cameoIt certainly wasn’t the fault of the orchestra who claimed our full attention with a precise and idiomatic overture, full of joyful energy under the direction of Julian Perkins. Perhaps it was the decision to keep the house-lights up until almost the end of the opera, diluting the focus on Simon Corder’s narrow but cleverly designed stage space in a way that might have worked for a bawdy, boozy 18th-century audience but couldn’t for the prim formality of a contemporary crowd.The conductor’s note describes Arne’s simple work as “one in which the characters are actors who happen to sing rather than vice versa” – a challenge, then, for GSMD’s opera rather than theatre students. Piran Legg’s lecherous old Master Martin (pictured right with Schneider and Langer) is a delicious caricature, and gets bonus point for singing in a false nose and chin which must play havoc with resonance.As his nemesis, the sweet but not over-bright young cooper Colin, Gerard Schneider shows enormous promise. This is a bold, warm tenor voice and lends real colour to Arne’s simple, strophic songs. His winsome warmth plays nicely off the sharp schemeing of Lauren Zolezzi’s Fanny, who though she sings sweetly has a tendency to rush, and seems rather ill at ease dramatically. Mention must also be made of Frazer B. Scott’s Scottish sot Mr Twigg, all bulbous nose and thrusting pelvis, seizing the stage in his brief cameo and transforming both it and the audience.While I was happy to make the acquaintance of the Arne, it’s not a work I’ll feel any great need to pursue further, unlike the Stradella which is a real find. The version performed here has been created by Perkins himself, padding out an oratorio with two instrumental interludes by Caldara and by supplementing the chorus’s role. The result is very persuasive – wide-ranging emotionally, psychologically fascinating, and containing some real musical delights (John the Baptist’s exquisite “Io per me” would be enough to convert anyone, while Erode’s “Tuonerà tra mille turbini"" thunders up there with Handel’s finest).More hands-on here than in the straightforward period comedy of the Arne, director Rodula Gaitanou places the action in an exotic no-place, a court filled with cross-dressing flappers and suspender-clad lovelies, whose excess is set against the pure severity of the Baptist and his disciples. Her real success is in drawing a performance of such ferocity and complexity from Anna Gillingham’s Salome – a Black Swan inspired creature, both child and woman in her tutu, gleeful and horrible, by turns innocent and stomach-turningly knowing. Gillingham’s voice is still a work-in-progress, currently lacking power and focus in its middle register, but flowering into such a potent top, giving a glimpse of extraordinary things to come for this soprano.Joseph Padfield’s Erode (pictured left with Langer) impresses with vocal muscularity and range, holding his own against the well-matched competition offered by Gillingham and Alison Langer as her mother Erodiade – a neurotic and carefully judged performance, giving her greater vocal scope and opportunity than the precious little ditties of the Arne. Tom Verney’s San Giovanni is efficient – particularly so in the coloratura sections – but needs to find a lovelier place for his tone to sit in lyrical sections.This was an evening of discovery – new music and new voices offering stimulation on every front. Thoughtful and interesting, this is why London’s student shows are far from second best to the big houses.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/san-giovanni-battistathe-cooper-guildhall-milton-court-theatre,4
424,"Vert-Vert, Garsington Opera",Vert-Vert,Garsington Opera,2014-06-11,Roderic Dunnett,"How delicious that Garsington Opera has turned to Offenbach. The main impetus for this cheering development, taken up by Artistic Director Douglas Boyd, is conductor David Parry, who both translates (extremely well) and wields the baton.Parry was recently legated a set of Offenbach scores gathered by the late Patric Schmid, father of Opera Rara, for a planned recording project spanning extracts from many of the French composer’s lesser-known operettas. Could this open up the prospect of numerous rarities to come? Something to equal Leonard Ingrams’ teasing out of Haydn operas, then rarer Strauss and Rossini; and in the new Boyd era, Vivaldi (L’Incoronazione di Dario, L’Olympiade)? No British companies have the nerve to stage all non-repertoire fare, like Wexford: but at least Garsington has acted as pioneer (neglected Schumann, Tchaikovsky, Martinů).One applauds the intention. So why – despite a “dead parrot” sketch, quite hilariously staged - does one feel underwhelmed by Martin Duncan’s admittedly hearty, diverting, giggleful production of Vert-Vert (penned 1869 – just before Napoleon III’s permissive France succumbed to Prussia and the Commune interlude)?I felt let down because Offenbach means something subtler than this romp-type approach - which gets so many aspects right, but is not sufficiently on target. Half the opera is set in or around a vonvent, and is a limp-ish attempt by librettists Meilhac and Nuitter “and others” – that often fatal phrase – to make a jolly out of chaps in uniform trying to access or abduct their belles (in delightful school uniform: Francis O’Connor’s costumes were simply glorious, and the manoeuvrability of his chateaux and garden walls – well done, the stage crew - make one’s eyes pop out).There are some wizard performers. You want to wrap up Fflur Wyn (pictured as Mimi above with dead parrot) up and spirit her away – the very point of the opera – whether she’s in blue school lacrosse-stick togs, or kitted out as a tiny scarlet bombardier. Naughty girlie chums Katie Bray (a super mezzo) and Raphaella Papadakis are scrumptious in their opening pranks too. Yvonne Howard is fun as the prim schoolmistress. Yet when Irish mezzo Naomi O’Connell (pictured below) opens her mouth as the popular chanteuse La Corilla, the whole musical experience zooms onto a whole new level. Coloratura to the gills, O’Connell is, inescapably, the big hit of this production.Yet things are already creaking. The problem actually begins in the pit, where the invaluable Parry, who delivers a spectacularly well-played – and spectacularly long – Overture, then seems to cream it far too often. A lot of noise is generated, not always to best effect. Offenbach needs to be played à point, avec delicatesse. It’s all about refinement – not just bashing things out like so-so Gilbert & Sullivan. I’ve heard subtler, pointilliste Offenbach from a dinky ensemble trotting out a touring (and much funnier) Robinson Crusoe. Imagine playing the Tales of Hoffmann Barcarolle con fortezza.Only intermittently – two super flutes, two bassoons, an engaging clarinet obbligato for Vert-Vert – do we get the kind of lucidity and poise that proves the French composer so uniquely, and deucedly, clever.The disaster is the choreography. It’s difficult to spot where Duncan’s role ends and young, though not inexperienced, choreographer Ewan Jones takes over, but much of the dance – more jigging - is weak, wet, limp, inedequately rehearsed and polished, short on real ideas. Too much like a school production, or badly prepared Rossini.This staging could have been so much better than it proves: not by changing it all, but by effecting what the cast actually does, better. Vocally the chaps are all good. When you have old pros like Mark Wilde (Binet the bossy, huffy-puffy gardener) and Geoffrey Dolton (terrific as ever, as Balidoro, the dancing master) it’s sad we don’t hear more of them actually singing. They provide the best buffoonery. Dutch-born baritone Quirijn de Lang and his Chevalier chum, tenor Andrew Glover, score especially in their chaps’ duet, which Parry shapes beautifully.Robert Murray proves he can act decently in the hapless title role (his appellation, Vert-Vert, was originally the name of the schoolgirls’ deceased pet parrot), achieving a weedy demeanour perfect for the role, but occasionally blossoming into beefy manliness. In some ways, with his gorgeous tenor, Murray holds things together. Oxford Lieder Young Artists Winner Alessandro Fischer is the other tenor delight of this mixed evening. So with Wilde, who could outdo them both, hovering with shears and plantpots, this time Wormsley really did offer us The Three Tenors.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/vert-vert-garsington-opera,3
425,"Don Giovanni, Glyndebourne Festival Opera",Don Giovanni,Glyndebourne Festival Opera,2014-06-09,ismene Brown,"Sex farce, class comedy, crime thriller, existential tragedy, supernatural shocker - Don Giovanni is, as Jonathan Kent notes about his production in the Glyndebourne programme, a cabinet of curiosities. Mozart's music hurdles to and fro across two centuries, the baroque 18th century and the disorientating romantic depths of the 19th; the characters are either stock (Leporello the comic sidekick, Anna the wronged virgin) or so subtle that they need redefining for every staging and every time (Elvira, and the lothario Don Giovanni himself). But again and again, Mozart’s 1787 opera proves itself not simply musically unbeatable but psychologically profound, and a piece where theatre designers and directors can flex their imaginative muscles.Given that the opera was intended to entertain and seduce (its plot falls to pieces in the second act), it leaves a wide-open field to make Giovanni anything from one of life’s wild delicious rebels, to philosophical sceptic, to appalling sex addict. Whatever he is, though, the audience needs to be seduced into taking leave of their sensible heads and falling headlong for him. Kent’s 2010 production, setting the opera in a Fifties Dolce Vita-meets-The Godfather Italy, flopped first time out, criticised as bland - but there's nothing bland at all about this return with a vivid new cast who play up the violence and sexual powerplay in the approach and deliver some exciting singing (the revival director is Kent's young protegé Lloyd Wood).By making Giovanni a reckless young mafia Don, Kent gives him an accurate setting for the clashes of sex and prudishness, law and licentiousness. Here, in a location made iconic for our own culture - Fifties fashions are so fab right now - is a parable about a male celebrity who believes in his entitlement to sex on demand beyond any form of correction, on earth or beyond.It’s a stylish way to reincarnate the themes of Mozart and his librettist Lorenzo da Ponte's opera, but more than that it connects some problematic characters into a behavioural world we totally understand. Leporello here becomes the corrupt paparazzo photographer who buzzes around the gangster, feeding his myth, Polaroid camera at the ready to snap the thousands of conquests (above, Crossley-Mercer humiliating Serena Farnocchia's Elvira). It could equally be Twenties America, or modern Russia - in this perverted, pseudo-religious setting it all makes sharp sense: Anna’s aristocratic weariness with men, passionate Elvira’s middle-class insignificance, and Zerlina’s knowledge, from the bottom of the social pile, of how to fight dirty and get back at the men who own the working classes.Designers Paul Brown and Mark Henderson realise the concept with flair and bravura, creating not just the location atmosphere but some expert coups de théâtre. Brown’s ingenious built set is a giant cube which is realistically a grand stone building until it begins revolving and unfolding. Like both zoëtrope and magic box, and animated by Henderson’s wizard lighting, it disgorges extravagant interiors and shapeshifting exteriors - a crumbling turret (with Giovanni shinning down it and almost falling off), a cathedral (Zerlina seduced on its steps as she emerges from her wedding, pictured below), Don Giovanni’s kitsch palazzo.Huge projections of 18th-century art - a sorrowing virgin, lusty lovers, and some startling sadistic porn - comment on the irrelevance of reason when the sexual urge is unleashed. The Catholic church is made strikingly present in Act 1 but there’s the whiff of cordite rather than sulphur in the manic disorderliness of Act 2's scenery meltdown. The Don is given a humiliating decline (his serenade in the cold street ignored, in the snow), and a dismal end, which might work on the page but it's downbeat on the stage.Still, the attention to detail in staging the many tricky group scenes has vivid wit and also psychological perspicuity (a tense argument about rape and betrayal taking place over the Commendatore's coffin in the cathedral). One doesn't expect singers to produce such expertise in stage use and committed acting naturalism, but I suspect this new cast has been selected to provide it. The reinvention of Leporello sets the tone, with the tall French-Irish baritone Edwin Crossley-Mercer as a charmingly louche hack whose morals are as depressingly ambiguous as the Don’s. With one of three very fine baritone voices on stage, and such a winning physical lankiness, Crossley-Mercer is also an amusing comic actor whose UK debut surely heralds a lot of love from British audiences.Canada provides two exceptional singer-actors in Layla Claire (Anna) and Elliot Madore (Don Giovanni). Both are strikingly handsome figures on stage (and it helps - for opera is theatre, as some of my colleagues were at pains to point out in the ""Dumpygate"" scandal over Der Rosenkavalier). The tall, blonde Claire has a ravishing soprano voice of trumpet-like clarity with creamy tragic colourings, and she comports herself with a stillness that gives a real moral intensity to Anna's ambiguity about her boyfriend Ottavio. Madore's Don is lithe and burnished of voice, a wholly persuasive, hyperactive young Roman gangster, scuttling up walls (pictured above, with Anna) and even riding bicycles as he sings, and swiftly beating Anna’s father to death.Someone should be credited for coaching the uninhibited nature of the frequent lovemaking, in which Madore and Lenka Máčiková’s platinum-blonde minx of a Zerlina look exceptionally convincing. The Slovakian soubrette proves the Don's equal in appetite and cruelty: when she catches Leporello in his disguise, she relishes tying him up, sexily peeling off her stockings to taunt him - it's pure theatre (making up for the dubious musical number). She’s also a delight of a singer, her piquant soprano complementing Brandon Cedel’s rather dignified Masetto, another impressive UK debutant.The only native Italian on stage (which shows in the enunciation) is the Elvira of Serena Farnocchia, who handles her character's loser aspect - and drab outfits - with unfailing musicality and dramatic sincerity. I thought Ben Johnson, the English tenor, was below his vocal best as Ottavio on first night - as a character he is doomed to be visibly overwhelmed by Claire’s dominant Anna, but he is given back the stage in a touching, subtle way for ""Dalla sua pace"" (Mozart's much better Vienna substitution for ""Il mio tesoro"") and the singer should rise to the occasion.The whole is excitingly tied together musically by the LPO under the rising star, the Vienna-trained Colombian, Andrés Orozco-Estrada - treating the score with a theatrical modern immediacy and very free all-colour effect that is almost Verdian in ensembles, but also enjoying the character potential of period textures (he gives “Ah, fuggi il traditor” an unexpected baroque starchiness that instantly labels poor Elvira po-faced). It works entirely in this staging and this house. Mozart intended a sparkling night of music theatre, and this is that, for today.Find @ismeneb on Twitter",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/don-giovanni-glyndebourne-festival-opera-1,4
426,"Benvenuto Cellini, English National Opera",Benvenuto Cellini,English National Opera,2014-06-06,alexandra Coghlan,"Tumblers, confetti, stiltwalkers, flags, crowds, a giant skull, and that’s just the overture. If anyone thought that Terry Gilliam might struggle to match the scope, scale or impact of 2011’s Damnation of Faust with his follow-up then they’re probably feeling rather foolish right about now.Gilliam’s Benvenuto Cellini is one of the most expensive productions ever seen at English National Opera. It’s also a notoriously challenging, rarely-staged hybrid of a work that failed (repeatedly) during the composer’s lifetime, and has since been largely consigned to the concert hall. So was it all worth it? Can all that glitter really translate to operatic gold?It doesn’t take a long look at Terry Gilliam’s CV – the sprawling Brazil, the ill-fated The Man Who Killed Don Quixote – to realise that the director has a fondness for noble failures and grand, doomed schemes. It doesn’t get much grander or more fatally flawed than Benvenuto Cellini – a work even the composer himself acknowledged “lack[s] the essential ingredients of what is known as well-made drama”.Berlioz’s debut opera started life as a comic opera, was rewritten as a serious drama and ended up settling somewhere between the two as an “opera semi-seria”. In Gilliam’s vision it’s more opera barely-seria – a giddy, naughty, baroque fantasy of itself, always poised right at the brink of theatrical hysteria. Author of one of the most vivid autobiographies of his day, Benvenuto Cellini was a self-dramatising master of semi-fiction. This is the story of the rebellious Renaissance goldsmith/ murderer/ rebel/ Casanova/ genius as the artist himself might have told it.Gilliam trades 16th-century Rome for a gleefully anachronistic Victorian anyplace, peopled with masked revellers, troglodytic foundry workers and extraordinary Church officials. Cellini (Michael Spyres) becomes a rapacious Bohemian in a sweat-stained wife-beater, while his beloved Teresa (Corinne Winters) is a curled and corseted Disney princess in her tower, oppressed by her overbearing father, but still perky enough to sing a pretty little cavatina and pout her way to true love with the man of her (rather limited) dreams.A plot too convoluted to bother untangling drifts between artistic ideals (Cellini must cast the mighty statue of Perseus for the Pope or else face death) and a token love story, but actually it’s everything swirling around these two strands that is most interesting. Prescient orchestral writing casts the instruments as commentators and narrators rather than accompanists – a detail not lost on Gilliam who gets some of his biggest laughs by flagging up these sardonic little comments in his affectionate direction. Just occasionally, however, he risks dulling their sotto voce wit by narrating them visually fortissimo.Berlioz’s triumphs in Cellini are the set-pieces: the carnival; the casting of the statue; the arrival of the Pope. The former sweeps through the opera house, dangling from boxes, cartwheeling down aisles and waving an oversized cucumber phallus round the stage. Gilliam revels in the teeming details, though wisely makes little attempt to yoke this orgiastic frolic to any serious subtext.Breaking through the frenzy and its aftershocks, Willard White’s worldly Pope Clement VII (as inevitable and right a bit of casting as Morgan Freeman playing God) glides in on a pimped-up Popemobile accompanied by some scene-stealing acolytes who see his camp and match it with their sci-fi-bondage clerical chic. White sings better than we’ve heard him for ages, and has a ball with this absurd creation.Spyres (pictured left), so excellent in the Royal Opera’s recent Donna del Lago, vaunts and vaults his way around Berlioz’s extreme writing, lovely even in the highest registers. Vocally less poised than her Violetta, Winters’s Theresa nevertheless brims with personality and blooms into some impassioned highlights, which make up for a little early strain. Both meet the challenge of Edward Gardner’s ferociously swift speeds, as do the swollen ENO Chorus who must chatter and chew their way through Charles Hart’s wordy libretto.A miracle of wit and invention, Hart’s freely-translated rhymes are one embellishment too far here. Jerking us out of the drama to marvel at verbal contortions (while acrobats perform gymnastic ones for our visual benefit), Hart misses the opportunity to offer a white wall against which Gilliam’s grotesques might better shine.With his generous, ambitious approach and restless visual daring, Gilliam’s production gets to the core of Berlioz’s opera. If only that core weren’t hollow he’d have an unqualified hit. As it is, even if the composer’s rebel artist is more bronze than goldsmith, ENO’s new production successfully gilds him with Gilliam’s signature sparkle.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/benvenuto-cellini-english-national-opera,4
427,"Peter Grimes, Grange Park",Peter Grimes,Grange Park,2014-05-31,alexandra Coghlan,"It takes a brave opera company indeed to stage Peter Grimes this summer. Benjamin Britten’s 2013 centenary celebrations took us to “peak Britten”, with performances of all his major works as well as the unprecedented, outstanding Grimes on the Beach. Then, this January, David Alden’s production of the opera returned to the Coliseum: direct, theatrical and if anything more potent than five years before. How then, could Grange Park – a David to the Goliaths of the Aldeburgh Festival and ENO – possibly compete?The answer, in Jeremy Sams’ quietly inventive production, is very well. Sams takes us back to poet George Crabbe’s 19th-century Borough rather than Britten’s 20th-century Aldeburgh. Among bonnets and wicker baskets, beards and fishing boats, and framed in the stern wooden embrace of the docks, the confinement and uncomfortable intimacy of these lives come back into focus.Francis O’Connor’s designs give us stylised realism – a digital ocean rolling at the back of the stage, a simple, flexible set that opens up gradually to let us peer behind the bleak facades and into church, home and hut. If it’s all a little too clean, a little too euphemistic a visual treatment of this harsh coastal life, then Sams’ direction steps in to rub a little dirt on its face.The Sea Interludes become the basis for a sequence of flashbacks that show us the young Peter and Ellen as children. We see Peter, already an outcast, attempt to break free from an abusive and alcoholic guardian, beaten violently at one point, at another sneaking a drink from the passed-out man’s hip-flask. Too often Ellen’s unshakeable devotion to the gruff, unfriendly Peter seems implausible, built on nothing, so to fill in these childhood blanks does help. It does however risk turning into an extended apologia for Grimes – demanding sympathy that Britten’s writing might provoke but never asks.There’s an elegance to this cycle of violence of old against young, where a larger question of the role of fathers (absent and otherwise) is raised as well as some topical issues about the nature of abuse. “Home! Do you call that home?” shout the chorus of Grimes’s hut – a question that’s a long way from being rhetorical here, and all the more interesting for that.Peter Grimes is the ultimate operatic ensemble piece, and Grange Park deliver quite the ensemble. When you have the wonderful Clive Bayley in the (very) supporting role of Swallow, it sets the tone for some very fine singing. Stephen Gadd’s Balstrode is bluffly personable, making free with Britten’s recitative to pleasing effect. He’s matched by Gary Griffiths – a Ned Keene with a twinkle in his eye as well as a pill in his pocket – and is if anything outdone by Andrew Rees’s superbly-sung Bob Boles, delivered at a sustained pitch of righteous hysteria.Rebecca de Pont Davies (last seen as Auntie in ENO’s Grimes) undergoes a transformation here to re-emerge as a crazed Mrs Sedley, relishing her “Murder most foul” with disturbing glee. Anne-Marie Owens’ Auntie, however, lacks anything of the character Davies found in her, the role sitting too low for Owens’s voice ever to flourish freely. The quartet rocked a little, never quite settling into that harmonic certainty that this rare moment of female alliance suggests.At the core of the action are Georgia Jarman’s Ellen (pictured left) and Carl Tanner’s Grimes – a pair of thwarted lovers as believable as any we’ve seen in the UK of late. Tanner, suffering from sinusitis, was fighting to deliver – a struggle only really evident in softer sections. Once compelled into the demands of “Now the Great Bear” or the mad scene, his muscle memory seemed to kick in and carry him through. Dramatically Tanner is an effective Peter – never tender, even for a moment, but interestingly damaged. Jarman’s Ellen was beautifully sung. The soprano’s voice is a rounded, glossy affair – perhaps almost too youthful and healthy for a role that needs suffering and struggle as much as it needs beauty.As in any good production of Grimes however, the chorus are the stars here. The small auditorium gives a dangerous intensity to their cries, and some subtle choreography and individual characterisation makes the mob scene particularly potent. It’s just a shame then that among so much intensity Stephen Barlow’s conducting keeps things so matter-of-fact throughout, generating energy, but never quite daring to linger and let the music do its work.It may be a year late, but as Britten tributes go Grange Park’s Peter Grimes is up there with the big boys.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/peter-grimes-grange-park,4
428,"Dialogues des Carmélites, Royal Opera",Dialogues des Carmélites,Royal Opera,2014-05-30,Edward Seckerson,"Poulenc’s Dialogues des Carmélites is a special and very particular opera. There is nothing else quite like it. Just as the drama - set to the composer’s own libretto - teeters between fear and faith, so too does Poulenc’s score, an extraordinary apposition of austerity and lushness where belief is harmonically consonant, festooned in seraphic harp glissandi and warmly homogeneous middle-voices. But fear is omnipresent in the shadows punctuating the score with a succession of precipitous dissonances and the alien sonorities of instruments like the piano.Robert Carsen’s beautiful staging has somehow imagined these stark contradictions visually, beginning with designer Michael Levine’s blank canvas of a stage (which Jean Kalman lights like one of those dark meditatory Rothkos - all grey, black and shadow) on which revolutionary turmoil and the inner lives of our God-fearing sisters unfolds like a ballet, figures in a hostile landscape. It sounds coldly abstract but it plays like a highly emotive dream.Imagine the restless populace as a pitiless tsunami washing across the stage, leaving a trail of debris, human and otherwise - that is one of Carsen’s recurring images. Sometimes this teeming shoal of humanity (a 67-strong Community Ensemble) is static in the shadows, sometimes it advances on us, the audience, impassive but somehow accusing. Lighting changes are locked into the rhythm and chordal punctuations of the score so the whole show, musically and dramatically, feels organic.But fear is the key, and two wonderful scenes - the death of the Prioress, Madame de Croissy (a no-holds-barred Deborah Polaski), who does not go quietly into the dark night of her soul, and Sister Blanche’s own crisis of faith - mirror what is happening on the streets of Paris. Polaski gives the former a gothic grandiosity while Sally Matthews’ Blanche is a transference of the Prioress‘s terrible doubt in the face of death. (Polaski and Sally Matthews pictured below).The intensity and fearlessness of Matthews‘ performance cannot be denied but the indistinct middle voice might well now be the casualty of her shift to a weightier repertoire where top and bottom are pushed to dramatic effect. Still commanding, no question, as is Emma Bell as Madame Lidoine displaying faith and vocal resolve enough for all her charges.Simon Rattle, conducting, so obviously loves this score, and what a spell he casts with its wonderfully diaphanous colours and especially rapt pianissimi. The precipitous fortissimi are not compromised, either - so a startling dynamic range - and I loved, too, the way he and the ROH Orchestra and Chorus make no apologies for the sumptuousness of Poulenc’s “religiosity”: the Lazarus and Gethsemane moments were almost indecently gorgeous.The always upsetting final scene brings the production’s most affecting dramatic coup, beginning when the nuns in unison disrobe from their black habits so that their white undergarments shine out from the black mass (in more ways than one) of the crowd. As the Salve Regina soars, now punctuated, violated, by the sound of the guillotine (now we know precisely what Poulenc’s precipitous chords foretold), each of the martyred sisters drop to the floor where their habits lay neatly folded - effectively waiting for their calling - at the start of the evening. A poetic symmetry indeed.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/dialogues-des-carm%C3%A9lites-royal-opera,4
429,"Der Rosenkavalier, CBSO, Nelsons, Symphony Hall Birmingham",Der Rosenkavalier,CBSO,2014-05-25,David Nice,"A trio of Rosenkavaliers: what more could one want as we near Richard Strauss’s 150th birthday? Well, more of the less often performed operas, for a start. But as this is the Straussian cornucopia, it’s not going to tire those of us who love it beyond reason, and Andris Nelsons’ concert performance with his devoted City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra eventually delivered as much in its rather peculiar way as the Barbican excerpts earlier this month and Richard Jones’ gobsmackingly original, disciplined take at Glyndebourne.So it was time again to forget the wigs, and at first it looked as if any whiff of stagecraft might go to pot as well, with Soile Isokoski’s Marschallin clasping her hands self-protectively before her in what should be the post-coital reflection and relaxation after the princess’s night of love with 17 year old Count Octavian (fresh and vivid memories of Anne Schwanewilms and Sarah Connolly so sensuous and entwined on the concert platform didn’t help). But here, too, was Alice Coote, the mezzo I’ve most wanted to see as Octavian, trying her best to interact, and once we got to the all-action second act, there was a new love to react to in the shape of the ever richer soprano of Sophie Bevan and a heightened sense of comedy from Franz Hawlata as the exuberantly sexist pig Baron Ochs, a bass so relaxed on the concert platform that he seemed to bewilder Nelsons with his podium interaction.As a concert version, it really hadn’t been thought through – considering how Justin Way liberated the platform in his Proms Wagner, or how Jurowski worked with Daniel Slater on the semi-staging of Peter Grimes, also seen in Birmingham, this seemed sloppy. If I were Nelsons (pictured above by Marco Borggreve), I’d have insisted on every singer discarding scores and stands, as only Isokoski, Coote and Hawlata did (Bevan knows her role too, from ENO performances, but maybe needed the prop for singing in German rather than English). Some singers, like Bonaventura Bottone as Valzacchi, didn’t seem to have learnt their parts thoroughly, and after the splendid male quartet of the LSO/Elder performance, the footmen with their tricky exclamations weren't uniformly good.Then how did it work as music? Liberation from the pit brought forth ripe, orgasmic-whooping horns at the start, and the amount of lacy detail throughout, especially from the woodwind and above all the consummate clarinet team, was staggering: this is a rococo score in every way. It was good to have the Elektraish uproar of the Ochs household chasing the Faninal maids in Act Two and the continuation of the Act Three tarantella as pantomime without the stage business – though the latter scene is one of Jones’s finest suits as Glyndebourne.Nelsons’ largesse with tempi didn’t always work for me in Act One, and sometimes stretched the singers a breath too far: the Marschallin’s monologues should be reflective but not sad and weighty, and with Isokoski sometimes over-weighting the chest voice, they verged too much on tragedy. All this, and the waltzes, were a long way from that ""certain Viennese sentimentality"" Strauss wanted at key points.Isokoski is a lovely singer, with poise and sympathy to spare, but only for me really hit her stride commanding the situation and untangling the love-mess in Act Three. The real first-act frisson came from the Italian tenor of Ji-Min Park, gliding in to his aria's difficult range with ease and charm.From Act Two onwards, though, the performance fired on all cylinders. You can take the Presentation of the Rose as slow as you like, like Bernstein, and so long as the singers are up to it, the magic will work. As it did here, with Bevan’s ripe sound (the soprano pictured above by Marco Borggreve) making hers at times a more voluptuous upper voice than Isokoski’s,even if its slimming to float was not as ecstatic as Lucy Crowe’s for Elder. The second duet, usually cast in the shade, was as luminously other-worldly as I’ve heard it, and with Hawlata (pictured below) waxing ever more boisterous, the shape of the act from its rumbustious climax down to the famous waltz scene went like a dream.It usually feels strange when our Knight of the Rose takes the last bow, and rarely gets the biggest applause, but mine was certainly that for Alice Coote’s Octavian: full-toned and ardent, effortlessly brilliant at the top of the voice, when needed, but also magically soft from the tenderest exclamation of “Marie-Theres’!” in the breakfast scene right to the final pianissimo. She seemed to be enjoying every minute, too, and kept her femininity with two floaty wraps over a black trouser suit.Nelsons might have opened up the cuts in concert, but that would have meant experienced singers learning more music, and we did get more of Ochs’s Falstaffian soliloquy before the waltz than at Glyndebourne. But finally we were there at the last hurdle. “It is at the end that a composer can achieve his finest effects”, wrote Strauss of the path to the great Trio and beyond; and Nelsons did that too, with an infinitely velvety cushion of sound for three great voices. Did I shed tears? I had trouble keeping the sobs from bursting into song. The ovation was mostly standing and absolutely ecstatic. That’s the magic of Rosenkavalier, and it doesn’t come more supernaturally bittersweet than this.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/der-rosenkavalier-cbso-nelsons-symphony-hall-birmingham,4
430,"Moses und Aron, Welsh National Opera",Moses und Aron,Welsh National Opera,2014-05-25,stephen Walsh,"Schoenberg’s last, unfinished, opera, seldom staged, might almost have been written for the Welsh. At its heart is some of the most refined and intricate choral writing since Bach, but linked to stage directions so complicated that one wonders whether the composer had any idea of the technical difficulties he was putting in the way of a fully realized production. The fact that this new WNO production funks most of the stage business is not the fault of the company’s truly marvellous chorus, whose musical performance alone would be worth twice the ticket price.As a conception, Moses und Aron is one of the most richly fascinating of “modern” operas (it was completed, so far as it ever got, 82 years ago). Its underlying subject, the chasm that separates spiritual ideas from their expression in terms that people can understand, is a direct allegory of the music in which Schoenberg cloaks it, composed according to a serial method as rigorous and abstract as the Mosaic law itself.A strange idea for a stage drama, you might think. But you’d be wrong. On two distinct levels, Schoenberg makes excellent theatre out of his idea. By casting Moses as a profound but inarticulate thinker who can speak but not sing, while his brother Aron “explains” his thoughts in lyric song that everyone can appreciate, he sets up an intriguing series of dialogues that, on the second level, trigger the brilliant choral sequences – as vivid in their way as anything in Wagner or Musorgsky – which climax in the bloodcurdling violence and abandon of the dance round the Golden Calf.The music overrides the stage nonsenseThis is a fine, Verdian design: the public and the private feeding on, and eventually destroying, one another. But it needs space: an empty stage, perhaps, Aron emerging from the wilderness like an aerial spirit, the people as a mobile and eventually uncontrolled throng, Moses seen from a distance bearing the tablets. These are outdoor settings. Jossi Wieler and Sergio Morabito absurdly locate the entire action in what might be a modern debating chamber (Act 1) or – the same without the microphones – a cinema (Act 2). There are hints at a Middle Eastern politics; an Egyptian flag is set on fire. But the chorus, in day dress, is stuck in a huddle at the back of the chamber, or in the seats, being harangued by Moses or Aron; and when it comes to the Golden Calf and the eagerly awaited orgy, the directors throw in the towel completely and offer a mirror audience watching these events on a screen which, like Moses’s God, is invisible and inconceivable to the rest of us. A more abject failure of theatre would be hard to imagine; unless of course the metaphor, though wrong, is deliberate.The music, though, overrides the stage nonsense. As the increasingly helpless, bewildered Moses, John Tomlinson gives a performance that is as touching as it is masterful. Few singers make sense of Schoenberg’s speech-song notation; Tomlinson does so completely. Hardly less impressive is Mark Le Brocq’s smooth-talking, shallow-thinking Aron, taken over at the last minute from an indisposed Rainer Trost, but sung with an assurance that belies the extreme difficulty of music whose lyricism is constantly moulded to a fixed and somewhat angular sequencing of notes. Le Brocq (pictured right in Opera North's House of the Dead), though understudying the role, had I gather never sung it with the orchestra or on stage. You could hardly have known.The rest of the cast are soloists who step out of the chorus. All are excellent, despite costumes and production that largely undermine their particular character. At one point in the score, Schoenberg nervously indicates that his Four Naked Virgins should be naked only “to the extent that the rules and necessities of the stage allow and require.” With Wieler and Morabito he needn’t have worried. The girls are never out of their jeans, even when being “violated” in the cinema seats, a spectacle about as sensual (or believable) as sex in Ambridge.At the helm, Lothar Koenigs is in his element. This dark, intense, intricate score is very much his thing, and he pilots the chorus and orchestra through it with few tremors and much exquisite detailing. Whether its esoteric music will ever be whistled by taxi drivers, as Schoenberg optimistically hoped, it still makes its impact in such expert hands, even without the theatre it deserves.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/moses-und-aron-welsh-national-opera,3
431,"Eugene Onegin, Glyndebourne",Eugene Onegin,Glyndebourne,2014-05-19,David Nice,"Is this the same Tatyana whose life depended on every word of her letter to straw idol Onegin at the 2009 Cardiff Singer of the World Competition? Then, Ekaterina Shcherbachenko – she’s since dropped the first “h” in transliteration – gave the most convincing, nuanced interpretation of Tchaikovsky’s famous Letter Scene, his reason for setting Pushkin’s verse-novel about youthful idealism and lost illusions. She enjoyed some success in Dmitri Tcherniakov's strangely compelling Bolshoi re-think. Now, though she looks ideally young and vulnerable, it’s all semaphoring gestures and telephone-directory phrasing – a void at the heart of a production that only fitfully delivers.Graham Vick’s Glyndebourne Onegin, graced by the clean lines of designer Richard Hudson, its elegant stage compositions and austere focus on the three main roles, became an instant classic on its first appearance in 1994, thanks largely to the white heat of that great, sadly short-careered singing actress Elena Prokina. Unlike Vick's stupendous Birmingham big top projects, it’s never been a very deep or psychologically nuanced production, and I find it difficult to adjust to its black and white characterizations after the sorely underrated subtleties of Kasper Holten’s much-maligned Royal Opera debut.This revival has been undertaken by Vick himself, and I’m fairly sure that his collaborator Ron Howell has added details to the choreography of country-house waltz and St Petersburg society polonaise (pictured right, the chorus in Act Three). That last is very funny where you want comedy and tragedy commingled as Onegin returns to his old stamping ground after trying to escape his guilt at the pointless murder in a duel of his best friend Lensky. It felt wrong that his first Act Three line, “here, too, I’m bored”, got a great post-champagne-and-supper laugh from the audience, though Andrei Bondarenko is charismatic enough a singer to draw us in to his predicament. The baritone sound is so handsome, the articulation always intelligent and musical, but last night he was in vocal trouble at the top, and like most of the other singers couldn’t be heard well midway back on the stage.This was partly the fault of the dressed-to-impress conductor, Israeli Omer Meir Wellber: a high-profile phraser who went for boldness and dash, effective in the dances and especially the Act Two Mazurka/Cotillion. But the orchestra was too loud, especially in the final scene, and not always adjusted to the singers’ needs. There was little of the subtlety we heard from Robin Ticciati in the Royal Opera Onegin – hard, too, to adjust after his infinitely sophisticated Rosenkavalier the previous evening – and from Vladimir Jurowski when this production was last seen at Glyndebourne.The most meaningful intensity of the evening came from Edgaras Montvidas as young poet Lensky (pictured left). The romantic looks, the ardour, the desperation at the party where Onegin keeps grabbing his girl out of pique at local gossip, the high notes: all were as good as I’ve ever found them in a Lensky, and we’ve had many excellent tenors in the role recently. Perhaps the vibrato is rather fast, but that suits the impetuousness well.It was unfortunate for Ekaterina Sergeeva’s rather loud Olga, his unthinking love, that Vick settled for presenting the less interesting sister at hyperactive face value (again, think of what Holten made of her). The elders, experienced Madam Larina Diana Montague and naturally plausible Nyanya Irina Tchistjakova, did all that was asked of them by Vick – not enough, perhaps – and the cameo couplets of the French tutor Triquet were elegantly delivered by François Piolino.At least Act Two did fire on all cylinders, with the chorus excellent as throughout and the stage pictures riveting. But Act Three was defused by a woolly-voiced Prince Gremin, Taras Shtonda, over-indulged in his action-freezing aria, and by the void that was Scherbachenko’s Tatyana, making it impossible for Bondarenko to fire up the crucial final duet of dashed hopes. For those who like opera-lite, it won’t have been a disappointing evening; for the rest of us, it rarely got under the skin of Tchaikovsky’s naturalistic masterpiece.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/eugene-onegin-glyndebourne,3
432,"Der Rosenkavalier, Glyndebourne",Der Rosenkavalier,Glyndebourne,2014-05-18,David Nice,"What spontaneous use might a silver rose take on after its formal presentation by a chubby cherub of a cavalier to a bartered bride-to-be? This and a thousand other score-co-ordinated details are things you never can predict in the hands of that chameleonic yet rigorous director Richard Jones. He throws out most of the meticulous stage directions in Hugo von Hofmannsthal’s rococo libretto for Richard Strauss and finds his own. You may not like them – I mostly did – but you can’t say that this isn’t quality work in tandem with a team of near-ideal Glyndebourne singers and beautifully if often unobtrusively paced conducting of the London Philharmonic Orchestra by Robin Ticciati.Jones gets you thinking, as always, about the myriad implications of a musical fantasia composed in 1910, looking back to the 1740s and perfectly capable of taking on 1930s film references (Marlene Dietrich as Catherine the Great is one of many striking templates). Much of the strictly choreographed action, with input from Sarah Fahie and performers in straight lines downstage, is counterintuitive to the naturalism Hofmannsthal had in mind, but it works if you let it.The re-imaginings are sometimes dark, always done with the light touch recommended by the opera’s principal character, the 30-something Marschallin with her consciousness of passing time. (Pictured below, Kate Royal's Marschallin with Tara Erraught as Octavian playing maid Mariandel.)Let’s start with the stage coup that sets up her soliloquy on that theme, extracting a general meditation on instability from the prospect of a middle-aged man marrying a young girl for money and her own situation as the lover of a teenage boy. She’s not alone; a bald, bespectacled, bearded gentleman with a notebook materializes at the back of the room. The minute she lies down on the long couch, we get the reference. There are ripples of knowing mirth in the audience, but only for a few seconds while the chamber orchestra sets up its “once upon a time” framework. As Kate Royal, unpredictably poised and diamantine as the opera's heart and soul once the fluttery vibrato settles, launches into her meditation on how this young girl doomed to a churlish older man is just like her younger self, we listen. You can hear a pin drop in the silences Ticciati judges so well, and time stands still with her monologue on stopping all the clocks, as it has the minute she’s observed that her hairdresser has “made an old woman” out of her.What women are made of by men is a crucial theme of the opera, even if Strauss and Hofmannsthal’s pre-feminist stance never allows the social straitjacket to be loosened. The Marschallin first appears stark naked under a shower, Venus Anodyomine – the first surprise, no bed onstage for the sex scene of the orchestral prelude, where the only rumpled sheets on the first night were in the orchestra, soon smoothed as Ticciati got the players under flexible control. Our gracious lady’s styles are dictated by an accordion-card of fashion plates, deliciously mirrored (all is symmetry in a Jones production) by the semi-clad girlie pictures unfolded by Baron Ochs’s lunkish retinue to the climax of the famous Act Two waltz. Sophie, the horse at a dealers’ fair, is made to stand on a table while bids are placed; did the Marschallin realize that sending her own lover was the girl’s only chance of escape?There are no boring bits, which may delight the many folk who dread the Act Three masquerade in a louche tavern. Jones is the master of making sticky operatic moments work, as his party scene for Tchaikovsky’s Queen of Spades spookily proved. This is inspired, too, and it made me cry with laughter. Mimi Jordan Sherin’s lighting, the Dayglo designs of Paul Steinberg, and Nicky Gillibrand's hybrid costumes do their genius work setting up the Baron’s discomfiture as the hired helps do weird routines and a noose drops from the triangular ceiling. There are three doors, too – all we need to set up a climactic trio which Jones leaves well alone, other than a sudden look from the older woman to the younger. After it, Sophie goes to follow the Marschallin as if magnetized, then Octavian does the same. The most wrenching moment in the final scene belongs not to the renunciatory Marschallin but to Sophie, as she crumples in despair at the thought that her new love has just walked out of the door for good.Do we believe in Tara Erraught’s naughty, dimpled little Cupid as the 17-year-old lover of the experienced Marschallin? Not really, though that may be part of the intended weirdness, and her vocal ardour, if often pressed to sharpness, is informed by meaningful physical gestures at each point (everyone knows how to lead, and be led by, their hands). What a funny, lovable mug, too. She/he is utterly convincing when lovestruck at first sight by a spirited virgin in Act Two (pictured above with Teodora Gheorghiu's Sophie). The scenes between the rosebearer and his circumscribed object of desire (Gheorghiu, perfectly spirited if vocally a little pale at times) are among the best, beautifully detailed as their second duet gives way to the apprehension by intriguers Valzacchi (Christopher Gillett) and Annina (Helene Schneiderman, wonderfully weird in the letter scene and when she apes a discarded peasant “wife”).Lars Woldt’s Ochs is riveting and original: not repulsive, as he too often can be, but genuinely funny, uncouth and Bunterish in his Austrian country wear. We begin to sympathise as, bum-sore and humiliated, he takes up a position on the couch in nouveau-riche Faninal’s proto-fascistic hallway as self-protective as the Marschallin’s in the previous act – though a glass of wine or three stop him resorting to her foetal position (Woldt pictured above with Helene Schneiderman's Annina). Vocally, it’s a nuanced performance – and the first time I’ve heard “heu”, in the phrase “you must have a haystack in the vicinity”, sung on a high note piano as Strauss asks. Very well, no bottom C in Act One, but you can't have quite everything.This is the biggest voice on stage, but the others don’t have to battle since Ticciati keeps the glinting, jewel-studded orchestra down as a magic carpet, stupendous in the velvety conspiratorial tarantella that launches Act 3, and vitally rosy for the last 20 minutes. The singing may be variable but the performances aren’t: everyone is there to serve Jones’s off-kilter and unyielding slice of story-telling, down to Miranda Keys’ opulent-sounding, red-wigged duenna, Alun Rhys-Jenkins as Faninal’s insistently sinister Major-Domo and the non-singing charactacterisations of Joseph Bader as Ochs’s tall, goofy bastard son, bemused but ultimately dazzled as we all are by Andrej Dunaev’s Italian Tenor and of Daniel Francis-Swaby as a winningly Marschallin-struck adolescent Mohammed (pictured above with Royal's Marschallin).So out with every drop of tired old business, in with the new order. In an utterly natural and admirable speech before the Prelude, Glyndebourne chatelain Gus Christie told us how his dear, recently departed old dad George might have had something to say about certain aspects, but would have gone with it. Go with it, too, and you’ll be tickled as well as touched and amazed. MORE RICHARD STRAUSS ON THEARTSDESKDer Rosenkavalier, Royal Opera (2009).

433,"Gawain, Barbican",Gawain,Barbican,2014-05-17,Kimon Daltas,"Part of the Birtwistle at 80 series at the Barbican, this not-quite-semi-staged Gawain ended up being held back a little by its shoestring production, where a straight concert performance might have transcended its limitations.The music, however, in all its dark, unremitting intensity, was extremely well served by an extended BBCSO, conducted by Martyn Brabbins, and outstanding solists, including John Tomlinson returning magnificently to the role he first created over 20 years ago. Leigh Melrose (Gawain), Jeffrey Lloyd Roberts (King Arthur), Laura Aikin (Morgan Le Fay), and Jennifer Johnston (Lady de Hautdesert) were impressively undaunted by the difficult score, and ably supported by the rest of the cast: a veritable showcase of British talent.John Lloyd Davies, who designed and directed, used lighting effectively to shift mood and create the sense of different spaces. Two large projection screens featuring digitally altered photographs for scene-setting (castle vaulting for the court, trees in silhouette for the journey, etc) might have been a neat addition if it hadn’t been for ye olde Celtic typeface used to announce the scenes, and occasionally comment cryptically and unhelpfully on the action. Other touches were much more potent, like the Green Knight’s first appearance, bathed in green light and smoke like all Arthur’s ghosts of Christmas come at once.The turning of the seasons, the protracted coda to the first act, typified some of the problems. As each season passes, Gawain is given chain-link, helmet and sword; but the props budget only stretched to a sword, so they kept re-giving it to him. Then Gawain would join Arthur and Guinevere in a conga line and walk round in a circle - to turn the season, presumably, but the result, exacerbated by repetition and the tight space, was faintly comical. They could all have stood still instead.The text also remains patchy, with lines – some oft-repeated – misstepping the line between allusive and just elusive. What does “This is the hour of vanity or choice” actually mean? With such rich source material, it is eyebrow raising to hear fortune cookie aphorisms like “Tomorrow will stumble on yesterday’s promise, cancelling everything”.There was much in the programme notes about the theatricality of Birtwistle’s conception, but the organisation is better understood as architectural. The ritual element of this Gawain, reflected in blocks of music, with the plot constantly turning in on itself – the seasons, Gawain being kitted out with armour, helmet and sword, the three hunts/kisses, etc – brings to mind the solidity in repetition of cathedral buttresses more than a concern for dramatic momentum. The tension is constant, ulcer inducing – you long for a shard of light to pierce through the cloud, but there are only occasional waves of bigger, louder tension.In the 1994 Covent Garden production (pictured above), the opera was the first outing of the short-lived Hecklers, but there was no such dissent at the Barbican, the composer’s arrival on stage being greeted with a standing ovation. Well-deserved too, for what remains an impressive achievement.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/gawain-barbican,3
434,"Così fan tutte, English National Opera",Così fan tutte,English National Opera,2014-05-17,alexandra Coghlan," A cheeky series of signs raised at the start of Phelim McDermott’s new Così fan tutte for English National Opera promise “Big Arias”, “Intrigue”, “Lust” and “Chocolate” (among other things). Big pledges, all. And almost all delivered by this witty, exuberant and quietly revisionist production of Mozart’s challenging comedy.The two young couples find themselves on holiday in Coney Island in the late 1950s, swapping twinsets, sensible flats and suppressed desires for the wild delights of the fair, where men wear lycra, women wear beards (and little else), and no fantasy or fetish remains unfulfilled.On the basis of McDermott’s two previous shows for ENO – Philip Glass’s Satyagraha and The Perfect American – it was hard to know what to expect of a director still finding his feet in the opera house. What looked like visual fussiness and a lack of musical trust in Glass (cascading papers, projections, giant fantastical creatures, mythic cityscapes) was here recast as a quite natural desire to fill in the gaps. Faced with the complicated excess of Mozart’s score and the complexity of his central quartet, McDermott didn’t so much do less, as do what he does more joyously and intelligently.Given characters rather than Glass’s awkward ciphers, he discovered wonderfully human details in them (aided throughout by a characteristically nimble and witty libretto from Jeremy Sams), relishing every foible and facet as well as those of their colourful surroundings. Together with designer Tom Pye, McDermott crafts an intoxicating world – part visual camp, part hallucinogenic horrow-show – in which everything is exaggerated, excessive. Love comes gliding past in a giant fibreglass swan, while despair sends you soaring into the air in your own personal hot air balloon.  A “Skills Ensemble” of real circus performers completes the scene – a freakshow into which Mozart’s figures dissolve with disconcerting ease.While the production is a winner, there were some musical kinks to this first performance (and, I suspect, this first run) that leave room for growth. Casting is the main culprit, a haphazard affair that had me wondering whether they had picked names out of a hat.Neither a show-stealingly charismatic Roderick Williams (Don Alfonso) nor an almost equally impressive Mary Bevan (Despina) felt like a natural fit for their roles. Although Bevan has charm in buckets and proved that she can sing wonderfully well in any accent asked of her (with or without line-dancing accompaniment), she still feels a bit light and a bit high for the worldly maid. Williams, by contrast, seems far too youthful, too energetic for her cynical fellow-schemer.Combine the youth and baritonal colours of Williams and the excellent Marcus Farnsworth (Guglielmo) and you lack those proper bass shades that would help root vocal action that often seemed in danger of losing its anchor. Everything about the show trades tragedy for laughs – an approach which works well dramatically, but which musically lacks that depth and power.Christine Rice as Dorabella (pictured left with Valentine) is luxury casting, and the mezzo seems to relish a rare opportunity to give her comedic skills an airing. But while I’m fully prepared to believe that Kate Valentine has a good Fiordiligi in her, this just wasn’t it. A voice that carved so delicately heartbreaking a path through “Porgi, amor” in the recent Figaro just wasn’t finding the same range here, forcing “Soave il vento” into a much more strident place than it should sit, and never quite feeling in command of the music. Tenor Randall Bills (Ferrando) had a tough night, almost coming off the rails entirely at one point, and feeling blurred and unfocused when compared to the HD of Farnsworth’s delivery. Ryan Wigglesworth’s pit was often at odds with the stage, which didn’t help, holding back as singers dashed forwards and never quite persuading them to settle into the orchestral tempos.No Così can be called great (or even good) until its ending, and here McDermott scores his final trick. The unusually feisty and appealing women are too human to default obediently to their original lovers, and the final ensemble stages a brisk communal wife-swap, with each trading each quite happily for another, no longer concerned by fidelity, loyalty or commitment. This is sexual politics Enlightenment-style, and in a cast of bearded ladies and flesh-eating demon-boys, what’s most shocking is just how contemporary it all feels. A sexist parable has become an anarchic fantasy – a transformation that’s no sideshow illusion.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/cos%C3%AC-fan-tutte-english-national-opera,4
435,"Yende, Vaughan, Cadogan Hall",Yende,Vaughan,2014-05-16,David Nice,"Lovely singer, consummate pianist, shame about the programme. “Art song” is a rather prissy term, but we could have done with a few to ballast a diet of old pop – French chansons, Italian canzonettas, Spanish canciones, Victor Herbert tralala. Even a few substantial operatic arias with piano accompaniment made have made a difference. Not that Pretty Yende didn’t reveal her instinctive musicality and the lessons of her bel canto training in Milan at some point in every number, but an evening of encores is just too much for even the sweetest tooth.In fact it was one of the genuine encores which told us why Yende is already so much in demand at the Met – Pamina, Lucia, Adina and Rosina are in prospect there, according to the programme -  and by several of the big European houses. Lauretta’s “O mio babbino caro” from Puccini’s Gianni Schicchi revealed it all in two minutes – the bloom on the bright lyric voice, with its forward placement much assisted by what sounded like idiomatic Italian, the artistry on the advancing and retreating note towards the end – pure messa di voce, not for the first time in the evening – and above all the interpretation of the role. Yende went not for sentimentality but for the urgency of Lauretta’s plea: the girl does threaten to throw herself in the Arno if her father won’t let her marry the man she loves, after all, and that’s a bit more than the mere coquetry we usually get outside the operatic context.The trouble, in short, with most of the numbers was that they gave little or no chance to forge the distinctive characterisation at which Yende would seem to excel. She's clearly a stage animal with the most natural of musical instincts, but most of the lyrics and their settings yielded only the most generalized possibilities. To do her credit, she made us realize how sad she was even when the bland, cheerful music of Donizetti’s “L’amor funesto”, too similar to the Rossini and Bellini songs before it, is so at odds with the sentiments. ""It is still an art,"" declares composer Flamand on an Italian duo in Richard Strauss's Capriccio, ""to use so cheerful a tune to express a terrible sorrow.""Yende is better than a lot of her materialThere were a couple of gems, at least, in the French quarter of the concert. The coloratura highlighted in Dell’Acqua’s “Villanelle” is something Yende does well, and much better than Anna Netrebko, if not yet at the very highest level, and the pitch very occasionally sags; I wonder if pure lyricism won’t remain her strongest suit. Pianist James Vaughan was especially good at encouraging and complementing the freedom of his singer with stylish lilt in waltz songs like Poulenc’s “Les chemins de l’amour” – but six specimens of the genre, however varied, were four too many. There are much better zarzuela numbers than the ones we heard by Geronimo Giménez, though they did at least allow Yende change into a much more fetching (flamenco) dress than the one she'd worn in the first half and begin to relax further, and one of Victor Herbert's sentimental ditties is quite enough (we got three).If all this sounds mean-spirited – and to be fair the audience, with its singalong contingent and a smattering of noisy Italians, absolutely loved it all – then it’s only stated with the concern that Yende is better than a lot of her material. Vaughan, Head of Music Staff at La Scala, where Yende trained at the Academy, must have felt a little unrewarded, too, though he did everything needed to support his singer. Strauss’s lighter songs, a more probing look into the French repertoire, even some better operetta numbers would have made all the difference. Still, the bottom line ought to be that we're lucky to hear such a quality voice at all. Of one thing I’m confident: when we see Yende in an operatic role here, and a Royal Opera debut is on the cards, she’ll own the stage and captivate us all.  ",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/yende-vaughan-cadogan-hall,3
436,"Down by the Greenwood Side, Harvey's Depot, Lewes",Down by the Greenwood Side,Harvey's Depot,2014-05-13,Bernard Hughes,"The question about Harrison Birtwistle’s Down by the Greenwood Side is: what is it? Designated by the composer as a “dramatic pastoral”, which is not very enlightening, it is not really an opera, nor a play with music, nor a piece of performance art, but somehow a winning combination of all three.Commissioned by the Brighton Festival in 1969, the revival of Down by the Greenwood Side is part of the celebrations for the composer’s 80th-birthday year, and Sir Harrison was in the sold-out audience at the Sunday performance. But it is hard to connect the present Birtwistle, elder statesman of the new music scene, with the feisty, aggressive iconoclasm of this early piece.The site-specific performance took place in the inspired location of a disused brewery depot in Lewes. The show started in the concrete yard, as the audience arrived. Nine bedraggled women quietly sang folksongs before moving in formation through the audience. St George (James Garnon) arrives on horseback, in a green string vest; a shaven, blindfolded prisoner arrives on a chain from the stables where he is kept. Four bowler-hatted and bow-tied Fight Club Men make preparations for a fight between St George and the shaven prisoner known as The Slasher (Nick Tigg). This is all before any music has started, except for an occasional tolling bell and gentle drum beat.Once we have moved inside, and the music starts, the story develops in two strands. In the middle of the room, on a raised boxing ring, St George (representing the coming of the new year) and The Slasher (representing winter) fight. St George is killed, twice, but returns to life. Meanwhile, on the raised grassy hillocks around the outside, a lone woman, Mrs Green, sings the ballad of a countrywoman who murders her twin sons. There is no interaction between these strands until the very end, when the stories start to blur.This production of Down by the Greenwood Side is a riotous, baffling, bawdy and eclectic thing, but a definite success. The music from the nine-piece band underpins the spoken dialogue and the sung sections, but offers a discursive commentary on the action, rather than accompanying in a traditional sense. The music is typical Birtwistle, determined, resolute, noisy and unsentimental, and operates as a force of nature. The band and conductor Christopher Stark were excellent. Aside from the knockabout action on stage, which was well choreographed, the emotional heart of the music is in Mrs Green’s ballads. Here, Elizabeth Cragg’s singing was raw and heartfelt, although the words were hard to distinguish from the other side of the space.But most praise must go to the director, Susannah Waters, who found a visual language that made sense of the more insane elements of the score, and created a performance which fit so snugly into its venue that they could have been made for each other. Ultimately, it does not matter what Down by the Greenwood Side is: it is, gloriously and eccentrically, what it is, and that should be celebrated.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/down-greenwood-side-harveys-depot-lewes,4
437,"Schwanewilms, Connolly, Crowe, LSO, Elder, Barbican",Schwanewilms,Connolly,2014-05-09,David Nice,"Mozart usually makes a fine concert bedfellow for his most devoted admirer among later composers, Richard Strauss. With the proviso that the 39th rather than the 38th Symphony would have made a better prologue to excerpts from Der Rosenkavalier last night – Mozart's later work has a minuet which Strauss imitates in the breakfast badinage of his Marschallin and Octavian, while the “Prague” Symphony has none – Sir Mark Elder made the companionship shine last night. The Barbican Hall took on a brightness for the Mozart, while the hall dazzled and spun as it must in any great Rosenkavalier encounter. And you wouldn’t find a better trio of ladies in any other performance, dare I say ever.Elder struck the right balances in the symphony. Literally so, by having first violins to his left and seconds to the right, for the “Prague” reminds us that Mozart was a pioneer in the antiphonal effects we tend to associate more with Wagner, Strauss, Mahler and Elgar. And as an interpretation, featuring all repeats including the second half of the finale, it had a near-perfect mix of light and shade, space and buoyancy. Conducting period instrument bands as well as lush ensembles like last night’s London Symphony Orchestra, Elder knows where to keep the strings vibrato-free and how to articulate phrases long and short. Besides, to my ears no authentic woodwind could gild the lily quite as beautifully as the LSO’s flutes, oboes and bassoons in the finale.If there’s a fault about Elder’s late-romantic conducting style, it seems to me that it lacks the ideal elasticity, the rubato, which bring the last degree of vivaciousness to Der Rosenkavalier in interpretations by Christian Thielemann and the late Carlos Kleiber. But he is a conductor whom singers can trust, as Anne Schwanewilms (pictured as the Marschallin above by Javier de Real) suggested in her interview with theartsdesk and bore out last night in her subtle interaction with the conductor when she stood next to the podium. Unaffectedly as tall, beautiful and magnetic as a classic film star in her signature red dress, Schwanewilms’ regal but always human Marschallin fixed all eyes on her from her first easy loveplay with Sarah Connolly’s impetuous Octavian (pictured below). Both singers have plenty of experience in their roles, so no wonder it all felt real, if with that extra frisson in concert of a lesbian relationship which once so repelled the prim Benjamin Britten.We got the orgiastic horns of the Prelude followed by post-coital bliss and Mozartian breakfast, the minuet-into-waltz properly cadenced for concert (Sir Charles Mackerras’s work, I believe). We then had the full emotional sweep of the Marschallin’s anger at the puffed-up, vulgar Baron Ochs’s easy assumption of marital privilege, her memory of a girl just like victim-to-be Sophie, herself, and the changed mood about ageing and instability it induces, baffling her young lover.There was perfect equilibrium here between the ardent boyishness and desolation of Connolly, pushing for proper effect, and Schwanewilms’ intimate inflection of Hofmannsthal’s magical text, silvery middle range, flawless white notes and full, womanly chest voice. She floated the high setting of “Ros’n” in her penultimate line of the act with a perfection I haven’t heard since Kiri te Kanawa moved us to similar tears back in the 1970s and 80s. For once, there was perfect synchronicity from the quartet of footmen - students from the Guildhall School's postgraduate courses, one of whom, Johannes Kammler, got to sing a crucial line later, very well indeed - and LSO leader Carmine Lauri led the “certain Viennese sentimentality”, as Strauss called it, of the quiet curtain to its hallowed conclusion. How right that Schwanewilms surprised him with a kiss at the end.Pretty young thing Sophie  always gets a tough time as romantic second fiddle – not least from our own Edward Seckerson in his comment on the role of Octavian – but she’s spirited and sympathetic, especially in the hands of as consummate a singer as Lucy Crowe (pictured right by Scott Rylander), who'd outshone the other ladies the last time the Royal Opera revived the opera. Here, of course, she was on equal footing, at least as far as the role demands. Her supernatural ectasy at “Wie himmlische, nicht irdische” (“how heavenly, unearthly”), reeling at the scent of Persian attar in Octavian’s silver rose (last night a real one), even made us momentarily forget our Marschallin as we were wafted up to the Barbican ceiling. How we felt for the girl’s pain and embarrassment under the kind but inevitably condescending inspection of the Princess, whose breaking heart Schwanewilms so consummately suggests between the poise of the final scene.The famous, ineffable trio? Never better, with Schwanewilms luminously nailing the big opening phrase of “Hab mir’s gelobt” – and if the orchestra swamped the voices at the climax, that’s the one point in the opera where it's allowed. The Strauss 150th anniversary celebrations roll on with two complete Rosenkavaliers this month - Richard Jones's production at Glyndebourne and Andris Nelsons conducting a Birmingham concert performance - but they'll be lucky to hit such heights. Heavenly, unearthly indeed.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/schwanewilms-connolly-crowe-lso-elder-barbican,4
438,"Thebans, English National Opera",Thebans,English National Opera,2014-05-04,alexandra Coghlan,"It’s been a bloody week on the London stage. First Titus Andronicus maims and mutilates at the Globe, and now at English National Opera Frank McGuinness and Julian Anderson bring us a distillation of Sophocles’ three Theban plays, complete with eye-gouging and assorted hangings. But while Lucy Bailey found eloquent meaning in Shakespeare’s brutality, could Anderson do the same in this, his first opera?This is thoughtful, hard-fought art that resists immediate assimilation. Thebans is the considered response to recent ENO premieres – the baffling Sunken Garden and insubstantial Two Boys – which concealed intellectual voids behind their digital trickery and gimmickry. Gone are the cutting-edge techniques and contemporary cool, and we’re back in opera’s favourite holiday destination of Ancient Greece.Each act condenses the action of one play from the original trilogy. We open with Oedipus the King, before reversing the chronologial sequence to place Antigone at the centre, finishing with Oedipus at Colonus. Labelled “Past”, “Future” and “Present”, the effect of the re-ordering of the three sections is to undermine any sense of narrative or contextual continuity. Individuals are less important than their repeating urges, motives, instincts, and though Anderson’s writing draws us in with intensely-felt arioso, his broader musical structure and ever-present chorus hold us at a distance.The trouble is that, with the longest act playing at around 50 minutes (and Antigone dispatched in an efficient 20), we’re given little time to care. With the action so telescoped, we open in tragedy and close in tragedy, with none of the ineluctable descent that makes the original plays so powerful. Instead of the usual sequential character development, we’re encouraged to embrace a more meditative approach. These are three variations on a theme: human frailty and desperation. Anderson and McGuinness are not telling us these stories, they are telling us about them.There’s no better painter of human weaknesses than Frank McGuinness, whose libretto is clean and direct, never indulgent in either word or emotion. His Creon is weak and urgent, lashing into action before doubts can even be acknowledged. Peter Hoare’s tenor is glossy and persuasive, a perfect musical politican and the natural father to Anthony Gregory’s radiantly-sung Haemon (a career-launching performance, surely). The vocal warmth of Roland Wood’s Oedipus (apparently ill, but with no sign of  weakness) is the only sympathetic element of a character beset by doubt and anger. The jaunty dance rhythms that suddenly invade the writing as he describes his past (revelations that will ultimately lead to tragedy) are delicately horrible, the musical universe playing a joke on a still-happy man.Creon is defied with passion by Julia Sporsén’s Antigone – ferociously sung, desperate and beautiful. It is she who has the opera’s final word, crying out desperately in an empty wasteland. There’s no consolation here, no resolution, no lessons learned from so much bloodshed. Anderson and McGuinness leave us battered and baffled but aesthetically satisfied.Anderson’s characteristically glowing musical textures – shifting soundscapes lively with colour and texture – take on a harder edge here. There’s a rhythmic propulsion to the music, driven by a large percussion section, that offers the counterbalance to the high, denatured noises of woodwind and strings. This is music changing and growing in time, and the themes of each act all emerge out of the one before. Andersons’s writing is at its best for the chorus, muscular, architectural lines that offer the scattered figures (dusty, linen-clad peasants for Act I, fascist followers in Act II, and disembodied voices in Act III) a corporate identity stronger than any individual.Pierre Audi’s direction gives the chorus a wonderful fluid unity, especially to their movement, finding the same shoal-like instincts as Willy Decker’s Peter Grimes. His soloists must exist within Anderson’s world of symbol and archetype, and they find a language of gesture and movement that effectively straddles the two.Thebans isn’t confronting or provocative as Mark-Anthony Turnage’s Greek so memorably was. Myths are beginning and end for Anderson, rather than a point of departure and difference. He revisits familiar tales in order to meditate and enrich rather than challenge, and the effect is subtle and satisfying. This is a serious piece of music-drama, a quiet opera whose full worth will take time to emerge. It deserves an ongoing life.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/thebans-english-national-opera,4
439,"La Calisto, Hampstead Garden Opera",La Calisto,Hampstead Garden Opera,2014-04-28,alexandra Coghlan,"Baroque operas are like buses. You wait years for some Cavalli to come along, and then three of his operas arrive almost at once. It all started with English Touring Opera’s Jason last October – a witty and endlessly shape-shifting work – followed by the Royal Opera’s glossy L’Ormindo at the Globe’s Sam Wanamaker Playhouse last month. Now, undeterred by larger rivals, Hampstead Garden Opera continue the trend with La Calisto.HGO are a fixture of London’s fringe opera scene, staging considered, well-funded productions with strong young singers in the theatre above Highgate’s Gatehouse pub. This latest is no exception, and if the vocal performances are more variable than sometimes this can be explained by the unusual challenges of Cavalli’s music. Rather than the formal recitative and aria divides of later opera seria, the composer’s music exists in a fluid space that drifts freely between recitative and arioso, rarely settling anywhere long or giving its singers a chance to settle into sustained musical set-pieces.Slashing the original score down to a brisk two hours, Joe Austin’s elegant production transplants the action to a post-apocalyptic landscape. Diana and her band of virgin huntresses roam over scrap-heaps and deserts in combats, Hunger Games-style, struggling for survival, while the Gods (apparently styled by Liza Minnelli) descend to meddle and seduce. It’s all a natural, plausible extrapolation of the original until the English libretto gets involved.The composite product of Anne Ridler and Austin’s own translation, its awkward, Anglo-Saxon architecture batters the ear with infelicities. This arisoso writing is unforgiving to anything but the smooth curves of Italian, but would have been better served by a more neutral translation than this effortfully current and colloquial approach. Once you get over that, however, there’s much to enjoy.The cast is dominated by Philippa Boyle’s ferocious Juno (pictured right). Here’s a woman you really wouldn’t want to wrong – all sequins and scheming vengeance, and in possession of some of the finest coloratura of the evening. Boyle took charge of Cavalli’s lines, playing with them texturally just as she toyed deliciously with Teresa Pells’ Calisto. Her wayward Jove (Peter Brooke) was a worthy consort, balancing schoolboy silliness with his spivvish henchman Mercury (Tom Dupernex) with some decidedly manly singing – finding a sustained melodic line through even the more fragmented moments of this music.Strong support comes from James Hall’s Endymion – surely this is a young countertenor we’re going to hear a lot more from – and his beloved Diana, the poised Felicity Turner. Special mention must also be made of Madeleine Sexton, as the oversexed “goat-boy” Satirino, whose grubby knees and gangling awkwardness are the perfect echo of her forthright vocal delivery, and made me long to see her Cherubino. Vocally miscast in the central role, soprano Teresa Pells (pictured left) struggled to contain her large instrument within the role’s fidgety, nimble contours. Tuning and precision both suffered, and she gave us power where we wanted delicacy and beauty - particularly frustrating when her acting was so good.Directed from the harpsichord by Oliver-John Ruthven, the band – Musica Poetica London – are a delight. Theorbo, recorders, harp and violins enrich the continuo core of cello and harpsichord, anchoring us firmly in the 17th century, and offering enough authenticity to chafe fruitfully against Austin’s stylized contemporary direction. So if you missed Jason or couldn’t get tickets to L’Ormindo, you could do a lot worse than explore Cavalli up in Highgate.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-calisto-hampstead-garden-opera,4
440,"Khovanshchina, Birmingham Opera Company",Khovanshchina,Birmingham Opera Company,2014-04-23,stephen Walsh,"Has anyone ever sat through Musorgsky’s last, not quite finished, opera about the struggle for power in Moscow at the time of Peter the Great’s accession in the 1690s, and come away with the slightest idea of what it’s all about? If Khovanshchina had depended for its impact on any kind of Verdian clarity or dramaturgical shape, it would long ago have sunk without trace.But then there’s the music, page after page of inspired, vivid, unforgettable choral writing and solo portraiture that at times even matches Boris Godunov in sheer immediacy and power. It’s a work that, against the odds, demands performance; and of all operas it’s one that justifies rethinking, which is what Graham Vick brings to it in his spectacular production for BOC in the Freedom Tent of Edgbaston’s Cannon Hill Park.Vick cleverly rechristens the piece Khovanskygate: A National Enquiry (for Musorgsky’s National Music Drama) and half-transplants it to modern Russia, where the Khovanskys (“say no to change”) are engaged in a violent campaign to seize the throne from the modernizing Tsar Peter (still so-called), in the face of the corrupt liberal politics of the west-sympathizing Prince Golitsyn and the ultra-conservative, banner-waving True Believers (“homosexuality is a sickness”). There are armies of uniformed, dayglow jacketed, peak-capped British-style police, continental riot police (of course), and crowds of woolly-hatted, flat-capped leaflet-distributing freedom protesters (""Hungry? Eat a banker""), both inside and outside the tent.This is all very exciting, though it can’t be said to clarify a great deal. On the contrary it introduces further layers of confusion. For instance, one can understand the drunken orgy of the streltsy (Ivan Khovansky’s private militia) in the original; but, whatever you may think of the Met, the idea of them rollicking en masse on the streets, and being bashed and berated there and then by their wives is pure cloud cuckoo land. If only! Max Hoehn has produced a partly recomposed English text to match Vick’s concept, but since it’s as indecipherable as most sung texts one is still baffled as to what all these characters are arguing about.Meanwhile the improbable emotional subtext – Andrey Khovansky’s drooling, unrequited and very public obsession with a young German girl, Marfa’s highly sexed and (in this production) possibly lesbian form of religious hysteria – remain as mysterious as Musorgsky, who spent years researching the Old Believers and the socio-ethnic context of late seventeenth-century Moscow, made them.So why is this production by a long way the most gripping of the half dozen or so I’ve seen in the past thirty-odd years? The uniformly superb quality of the singing and playing is obviously the most important factor. Without that, Khovanshchina would crash on take-off: a less performance-proof opera hardly exists. But I have reluctantly to admit that it also responds brilliantly to the mobile context. In the Freedom Tent the audience stands for the entire three hours of Musorgsky’s score, turning this way and that to face a series of platforms and arenas (designers Samal Blak and Giuseppe Di Iorio), being pushed around and kettled up like any crowd of innocent bystanders at a perfectly legal demonstration. The choral scenes, especially, take on terrific energy from the sense of mobile space and the sheer presence of top-class choral singers elbowing their way through the audience, or popping up next to you, so that for a minute you wonder if you aren’t supposed to be joining in (I did once – the music is so irresistible.Another factor to do with this extraordinary space is the placing of the orchestra, on a rostrum along one side of the tent and a good ten or twelve feet up. To be able to hear the orchestra in this way – in Shostakovich’s powerful if sometimes anachronistically scored version – is a marvellous bonus which, on the whole, doesn’t prejudice vocal balance or (with some minor exceptions) ensemble. The playing by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra under Stuart Stratford is beyond praise. And in this version we hear so much music that Rimsky-Korsakov, in his original “completion,” left out, including the marvellous, incomprehensible scene in which the Scribe is tormented by a crowd of Muscovy homeless and his booth smashed up. Oh dear! Why couldn’t Musorgsky have lived to be seventy instead of dying of drink at 42?The cast needs listing in detail: Eric Greene’s majestic, larger-than-life Khovansky, Robert Winslade Anderson’s sinister, trilby-hatted Shaklovity (described here as the tsar’s “policy adviser,” though in Musorgsky his allegiance is much less clear), and Keel Watson’s stately Dosifei (pictured above). These three wonderful black singers hint at a modern political dimension very far from the Moscow of any age. Also excellent are Jeffrey Lloyd Roberts’s shambling Golitsyn and Paul Nilon’s nervy Scribe, one of several sharp-eyed character inventions in a scenario whose main personages are (more or less) historical figures.Musorgsky saw Marfa as a complex, sexually motivated thirty-somethingBut the best of these inventions is certainly the contralto, Marfa, whom Musorgsky saw as a complex, sexually motivated thirty-something, but who is usually played as a frumpish matron with no more than the embarrassing memory of a glad eye. Claudia Huckle’s reading of this role brings it to life for the first time in my experience. She makes Marfa both physically attractive and believably a hysteric, without over-playing, but with superb vocal sonority and control. She even – with a  lot of help from Hannah Mason – manages to give her strictly irrelevant scene with fellow Old Believer Susanna some dramatic point, though the lesbian implications perhaps raise more problems than they solve. The scenes with the German girl Emma (Stephanie Corley) and Andrey Khovansky, excellent though Joseph Guyton is in the role, remain problematic.Finally the Birmingham Opera Chorus, brilliantly stage managed by Vick and the movement director Ron Howell, sing their hearts out, inspired – one would like to think – by their proximity to the paying customers. More Russian opera, please, in the Freedom Tent.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/khovanshchina-birmingham-opera-company,4
441,"La Traviata, Royal Opera",La Traviata,Royal Opera,2014-04-20,Sebastian Scotney,"The German soprano Diana Damrau has had the role of Violetta Valéry in La Traviata in her sights for a very long time. As she has explained in interviews, seeing the Zeffirelli film of the opera, with Teresa Stratas in the title role, as a 12-year old was a decisive moment in making her want to become a singer. That was 30 years ago. Now, as the pre-eminent high soprano in the world, she is performing the role in several leading opera houses. Last night she made her debut as Violetta at Covent Garden.Damrau's musicality and security of vocal line are spellbinding. It is impossible to imagine the role being more cleanly, accurately or musically sung. Her sense of line and phrase are impeccable. The top E flat (her choice, the score gives no instruction) at the end of “Sempre libera” in Act One rang out strong and completely true. It didn't feel shrieky or dangerous, but rather what Damrau is there for. According to the people who know and care about these things (see video overleaf), that note sits comfortably in her vocal range, which can extend up to a fourth higher – to a G sharp.Damrau also brought a consistent and clear definition to the character. The moments in Act Two and Three when she beseeches either the men around her, or God, to understand the wretchedness of her fate were made to count, and were extremely affecting. Her singing of ""you cannot understand all the love in this heart"" as Alfredo abandons her was particularly poignant.The male protagonists were the Sardinian tenor Francesco Demuro as Alfredo and Dmitri Hvorostovsky (pictured below) as his father. Demuro has a pleasing tone, more lirico than truly spinto, and sings the role well rather than remarkably. Hvorostovsky received his first round of applause, rock-star style, for the mere fact of having walked onto the stage. His Act Two aria was delivered with beautiful full tone, his contrition in the final act seemed genuine, but overall what he brings to the role is an air of coldness and detachment. A defining moment came when Violetta asked him to accept him to accept her as a daughter and threw herself at him. He stood there implacably like a statue; she just fell away.A voice in a minor part which stood out as strong, characterful and distinctive was that of another Russian, the Bolshoi-trained mezzo-soprano Nadezhda Karyazina. Jihoon Kim as Doctor Grenvil was another strong piece of casting.The production, which was Richard Eyre's first venture into opera directing, with designs set in the historically correct period by Bob Crowley, is now 20 years old. It has developed its own performance history and frames of reference. It has been issued on DVD in two different versions. One element of continuity is the presence of Director of movement Jane Gibson, who has handled the gipsy/ matador episodes with finesse and understanding since 1994. The chorus and dancers made a superb contribution here. Although they had given some of the highlights of the evening, the whole ensemble didn't get the curtain-call they deserved.Israeli conductor Dan Ettinger did not have a great first night. People recalled in the first interval the sparks which Solti had generated right from the start of the very first performance of the production, and by those standards, this one seemed very underpowered. Ettinger's real problems came later, however, in handling the many allargandos and morendos which bring numbers to a quiet close. His slowing-down of the pulse failed to communicate properly to either stage or pit, and several of those moments sounded very hesitant indeed, rather than fitting in as a natural part of Verdi's musical and dramatic language. Things are bound to get better during the run. But this was Damrau's evening. Opera-lovers and devotees of fine singing will not want to miss her authoritative, vocally triumphant Violetta. She takes the role on more six evenings between now and early May, when another cast, led by the American soprano Ailyn Perez and Simon Keenlyside, will take over.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-traviata-royal-opera-0,4
442,"Powder Her Face, English National Opera, Ambika P3",Powder Her Face,English National Opera,2014-04-03,alexandra Coghlan,"The opening gyrations of Thomas Adès’s bluesy, schmoozy overture to Powder Her Face beckon you into a world of cheap sensation and excess. Accordion, saxophones and sizzle cymbal add their indecent, after-hours suggestions, and you have a microcosm in moments. Almost 20 years on from its premiere, Adès’s opera about the scandalous “Dirty Duchess” still has all the moves. What a shame then that these are obscured in the baggy, cavernous space of English National Opera’s latest field-trip venue – the University of Westminster’s Ambika P3 concrete bunker.Press notes might insist that the venue (used here for opera for the first time) is “intimate”, but I can’t work out whether it’s the exposed pipe-work or the towering, tiered rows of seating that is supposed to give this impression. Powder Her Face is a work that enjoys clandestine assignations in hotel rooms and private apartments – barely leaving the bed, let alone the bedroom, except for a shattering scene in court – and framed in this boomy, vertical space doesn’t give up its charms willingly.Director Joe Hill-Gibbins, making his opera debut, clearly has a plan. Seated in stiff, upright wooden rows, peering down on the action from above, it’s clear that we’re in the public galleries of a law court – voyeurs on the scandalous action playing out below. On paper it’s a clever device, forcing us into uneasy complicity with the journalists and photographers that hound the Duchess. Practically though it’s a problem.Opera is never ideal in the traverse; you lose a lot of tone and almost all verbal clarity every time the singers turn around, and if (as here, bafflingly) there are no surtitles to help you then you might as well give up and enjoy the music. Adès’s colourful band is placed centrally, and although partially dulled by a helpful overhang, pretty much overwhelms all in its path. With a libretto as tight and witty and Philip Hensher’s this is close to criminal, and much of the opera’s off-the-cuff naughtiness is lost.Which is shame, because everything else here is pretty excellent. Alan Ewing’s extraordinary, flexible bass was made for the role of the Hotel Manager (who doubles as the Duke and, in a wonderful coup de theatre, the judge). Roaming from floated falsetto to the rumbling lowest registers, he (pictured right with Amanda Roocroft) comes into his own in the courtroom aria, torn musically between gruff, objective formality and wild personal rage. Ewing’s lurching shifts of mood were skilfully handled – a rare moment of abandon before the horrible control of his final encounter with the fading Duchess: “Your car is here. That is all, Madam.”Amanda Roocroft makes a rare foray into this repertoire as the Duchess. Vocally it’s a impressive performance, giving her real stature and gravitas, and transforming the final scene into something almost Janáček-like - a tonal shift this impersonal space and Hill-Gibbins' alienation really does enhance. Directorially I question the decision to style her as old throughout. An opera that travels swiftly through time is tricky to manage, but a more obviously youthful, attractive Duchess at the start would make for a greater shock and contrast to her final desperate moments as an old woman, still clinging to long-faded attractions.Alexander Sprague (electrician) and Claire Eggington (maid, pictured left with Sprague) tackle Adès’s virtuoso vocal writing with easy skill. It’s a shame that Eggington’s high register collides so hard with this acoustic, obscuring much of the detail she and the forces around her are putting in, but there’s no doubting the blossoming loveliness of her Strauss-inspired moments of release. Sprague too sits happily at the extremes of his voice, and it would be wonderful to hear this young tenor with his agile, muscular instrument in the Coliseum itself again.Ultz’s designs are stylish and perfectly too-much, from his neon-glowing portions of meat in aspic to a mauve bathtub, but it all lacks impact with the audience so far removed. When I wasm’t straining to hear the libretto or peering to see what was happening so far below I was yearning for the claustrophic intimacy and confrontations of Carlos Wagner’s 2008 production at the Linbury Studio Theatre. Up close and entirely too personal, that was a show that really got the (blow-)job done.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/powder-her-face-english-national-opera-ambika-p3,3
443,"Prince Igor, Novaya Opera, London Coliseum",Prince Igor,Novaya Opera,2014-04-02,David Nice,"Had this Moscow production any serious ideas in its head until its suddenly effective epilogue, much might have been pertinently said about an opera in which an imperialistic campaign ends in disaster, and where the Polovtsian “enemy” shows far more signs of a civilized life and wartime courtesy than the corrupt, crumbling court at home. Unfortunately veteran director Yuri Alexandrov’s very selective take on Borodin’s fitfully wondrous score asks for not a moment of dramatic truth from its principal singers: a great shame, because the voices are never less than stalwart, the chorus and orchestra under Jan Latham-Koenig’s mostly secure direction the kind of high Russian quality you might expect.I don’t remember the Kolobov Novaya Opera Theatre of Moscow, to give its current full name, ever being as crass as this when I saw it in its ostentatious new theatre three years after its founding in 1997. Then there were high hopes for a production style which, if not as wifully radical as that of the very hit-and-miss Helikon company, could forge a strong alternative to Bolshoy tradition. Now it’s the Bolshoy which is welcoming in new directorial talent, albeit from abroad, while over at the Novaya Opera the spare, well-designed sets I remember from the 2000 Boris Godunov have been replaced by vulgar, tinselly awfulness in the one “exotic” act we get here, lacking even the charm of the painted flats in the old style. Stage and costume designer Vyacheslav Okunev has clearly been given too much new money to fling around.The scenes in 12th century Putivl, Igor’s base in this anachronistic piece of nationalism with a twist, go well enough to begin with. Alexandrov postpones Glazunov’s marvellous work on the second-best Russian operatic overture after Glinka’s Ruslan and Lyudmila until after the Prologue (and then only gives us half of it). That makes us think we’re in for a journey along the Dnieper to the Polovtsian camp where Igor is quickly made a hospitably treated captive (Sergey Artamonov pictured below) – acts have previously been reversed in the Mariinsky version – but we stay in Putivl and, overture apart, have to wait for the big tunes until after the interval.Warning signs soon creep in. The chorus are still up to the bad old sashaying, overacting tricks that bedevilled their Kirov counterparts 20 years ago; they sing well, but lack stage discipline. More worrying are the hunchback sisters busying themselves around Igor’s deserted wife Yaroslavna – first of much nonsensical (sorry, in this case  nunsensical) movement business bedevilling every character who should be left alone. Much could have been made of corrupt Prince Galitsky (“Prince of Galich” here) and his drunken henchman lording it over defenceless women. But while an updated, Russian plutocrat debauchery might have been a latter-day cliché, here the stereotypes belong to the old school, everyone on stage having way too much of a good time to make any serious point about the roles of the sexes in a decadent patriarchal society.Still, we’ve had stalwart singing from Sergey Artamonov’s legs-akimbo Igor and Evgeny Stavinsky’s not unattractive Galitsky – the only singer who shows any acting ability, albeit way over the top – and serviceable if typically squally-Russian-soprano work from Elena Popovskaya’s Yaroslavna (a sign of the company’s musical strengths is the double or triple casting; you may get better or worse if you go).It all starts to fall risibly apart in Borodin’s gem, the uninterrupted sequence of pure inspiration in the Polovtsian camp – or is it the Polovtsian sex club in downtown Moscow? Why dress the Khan’s daughter Konchakovna (Agunda Kulaeva, another useful singer, stereotypical Russian mezzo this time) in the Russian equivalent of Ann Summers lingerie for large ladies? There’s no reason for her not to be an alluring but chaste eastern woman. When her would be lover Vladimir, Igor’s son, comes on, he seems to be addressing his love to two girly catamites, though it soon becomes clear that Kulaeva's butch, straddling dominatrix is the object of his desires. Tenor Aleksey Tatarintsev provides the most stylish singing of the evening, but is sabotaged by the ludicrous stage wrestling with his big beloved.But you ain’t seen nothing yet: the ensuing farrago would have been jettisoned even from ENO's ill-fated staging of the kitschy Borodin musical Kismet. I gaped in disbelief at the so-called “choreography” for the rightly celebrated Polovtsian Dances: writhing, bare-bellied ladies wheeled on in baths or rolled out from carpets, hand-waggling Al Jolson style instead of any leaps from the men as the music demands – Fokine would jeté from his grave in horror – and a general melée of unpretty figures in what I guess is supposed to be Igor’s nightmare. It was certainly mine, and the urge to boo – which I never have done and never will – had to be suppressed.Having cut the seven musical numbers Rimsky-Korsakov pieced together for Act Three, Alexandrov didn’t detain us long with the last act either. Yaroslavna’s lament was pierced last night by loud male hubbub behind the drop curtain. Then we got the duet with returning hubby, hair highlights for ageing added courtesy of the Polovtsian salon, and then no celebration, only the plangent a cappella lament about Russia’s devastation by the barbarian hordes: beautifully sung by a chorus at last completely still (pictured above).Did Alexandrov have something to say after all? “We have forgotten to repent and acknowledge our mistakes,” which is what he writes in the programme, might even be a veiled hint at his country’s disastrous present course. But it was too late for that; the ultimate impression remains one of a musical world which can still field the strongest singers and players, but drowns their sterling virtues in a sea of bling, stand-and-deliver hokum and muddled messages.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/prince-igor-novaya-opera-london-coliseum,2
444,"L’Ormindo, Royal Opera, Sam Wanamaker Playhouse",L’Ormindo,Royal Opera,2014-03-26,Kimon Daltas,"The Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, the new indoor Jacobean theatre at The Globe, is an absolute jewel of painstaking historical research and craftsmanship. It is small, seating around 350, and with its thrust stage lit by around 100 candles (with electric light only on the musicians’ gallery in this performance), it is a challenging space to put on an opera, but also a uniquely atmospheric one.It many ways this Royal Opera/Shakespeare’s Globe co-production is experimental, with everyone involved having to learn from scratch how to work within these limitations, and also what opportunities for theatrical magic they may provide: no fancy video projection has ever delighted an audience as much as a white-clad ‘Music’ being lowered on wires though a trapdoor in the heavens to sing her prologue.The candles are also used imaginatively, with various ‘lighting states’ created by adjusting the height of the six chandeliers, or by cast members carrying lanterns and candelabras to create the 17th-century equivalent of a followspot. A cowled Death methodically snuffing out flames as the (apparently) doomed lovers sing their duet is a particularly memorable moment.There is no staging other than the panelled and painted back wall itself, but visual interest is maintained throughout by the costumes of haute couture trained Anja Vang Kragh, some merely exquisite, others fantastic and hilarious – such as the one designed to depict Erisbe in bed, complete with cushions and bedstead.Kasper Holten’s direction is high on farce, and the audience chortles appreciatively throughout. Having turned on the laughs, however, this production mostly fails to escape them and, though the piece can’t be anything but a happily-ever-after rom-com, it ought to have space for poignancy, even sombreness.An unexpected star of the show is Christopher Cowell’s translation and adaptation of the libretto. It is certainly funny but also elegant and poetic in a cod-Shakespearean manner, with the odd glaring anachronism thrown in for good measure.The small period-instrument band, on the gallery above and behind the stage, is made up of musicians from the Early Opera Company Orchestra, conducted by Christian Curnyn from the harpsichord. One can imagine it is a challenge to communicate with the singers from that position, but there is certainly no sign of difficulty. The ensemble cast includes three Royal Opera debuts, which suggests that this intimate theatre may play a useful role in nurturing young voices.  The ones here certainly deserve nurturing, with star turns from debutants Samuel Boden (Ormindo), Susanna Hurrell (Erisbe), and Joélle Harvey as Sicle (pictured above cameoing as Lady Luck). Most of the rest of the cast are up-and-coming too, with Ed Lyon (Amidas), James Laing (Nerillus), Rachel Kelly (Mirinda) and Ashley Riches (Osman) all doing themselves proud. Old hands Harry Nicoll (Eryka) and Graeme Broadbent (Ariademus) complete the very enjoyable picture.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/l%E2%80%99ormindo-royal-opera-sam-wanamaker-playhouse,4
445,"Die Frau ohne Schatten, Royal Opera",Die Frau ohne Schatten,Royal Opera,2014-03-15,David Nice,"The big message of The Woman Without a Shadow, brushing aside the narrower, moral majority preaching that you’re incomplete without children, seems clear: fulfillment can’t be bought at the cost of another’s suffering. Yet the path towards that realization in this ""massive and artificial fairy-tale"", as an increasingly alienated Richard Strauss called it, is strewn with magnificent thorns in both his complex, layered music and Hugo von Hofmannsthal’s elaborate symbolic libretto.Stagings tend to have gone either for a series of pretty, unconnected fairy-tale pictures to throw light and colour around the usually stolid team of heroic singers – as in the Royal Opera’s previous production directed by John Cox but dominated by David Hockney’s hit-and-miss designs, and Jonathan Kent's fizzle-out Mariinsky show – or for pure psychology without the magic context (Christof Loy’s compelling but sometimes too confusing Salzburg Festival production). Claus Guth’s dream-interpretation, arriving at the Royal Opera after a run at Milan's Teatro all Scala, seems to me somewhere convincingly in between. It’s illuminated by strong ideas of its own and is very much of a closely-detailed piece with five superb singers, all of whom hit the ridiculously frequent loud high notes head on, and very impressive, impeccably well-prepared orchestral playing under Semyon Bychkov.A woman tosses uneasily on a hospital bed in an oppressive wood-panelled room with only one murky window – familiar-looking but impressive designs by Christian Schmidt – attended to by husband, doctor and nurse. She could have had a miscarriage, she may be suffering from mental illness; invent your own back story. What it certainly means is that this is an “it was only a dream” kind of production where anything goes. But that’s fine, given that Guth convincingly follows through the parallel of the heroine’s stuck marriage with the dysfunctional relationship between the mortal wife whose shadow her Mephistophelian Nurse says she must obtain to stop her Emperor turning to stone, and the second woman’s husband, the rather placid, good but ox-like Barak (a butcher rather than a dyer in this production).The other woman, the so-called Dyer’s Wife, is the Empress’s shadow here, or vice-versa, as they act out mirror-image reactions to frustrating spouses (Elena Pankratova and Emily Magee pictured, above right), and it’s to Guth’s credit that he follows through the argument to a final court room “reunion” akin to the nightmarish trial scene in Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. It's an oddly appropriate denouement when the score – in which Strauss, having begun so brilliantly, seems to have lost faith, waiting on Hofmannsthal for the completion of the libretto during tricky First World War years – is strident and overloaded in its supposed jubilation.The magic is conveyed from the pit, of course, in the chimerical shape of an incandescent Royal Opera Orchestra, and on stage through three animal-headed figures. Chief is mathe gazelle who, in Pullmanesque terms, is the Empress’s daemon (Hofmannsthal’s idea, that she was shot and captured by the possessive hunter-Emperor). So it makes sense that her father, spirit-world ruler Keikobad, is a stick-propped antelope in frock coat. Most haunting is the falcon which the Emperor used to capture his wife, a bird-headed, winged young woman whose haunting cries punctuate the score. The executors of Keikobad's will are black-winged angels who invade the basement world of Barak's room (pictured below). Andi A. Müller’s video projection does the rest with sperm-like fish, foetuses, even the necessary fire and water in the cataclysmic end of the turbulent Second Act. Out of the strong singers playing the two couples only Emily Magee as the Empress, onstage nearly throughout (as was Anne Schwanewilms in Loy's production), is required to act much, which she does with enormous sympathy and a gracious presence. Sinuous, magnificent, even amusing, is that mistress of German speech-melody Michaela Schuster (pictured below) as the Nurse. She looks fabulous, and her low notes are as resplendent as Magee’s tireless upper register.Also hitting the heights are top heroic tenor Johan Botha, who never moves much and doesn’t have to as the stonebound archetypal domineering romantic, and Elena Pankratova, magnificent in the Wife’s big rejection-of-childbearing scene before going on to unfurl ideal long Straussian phrases in a stricken repentance aria and duet at the beginning of Act Three. She can do the quiet, intimate stuff, too: the production's slant towards the women is never clearer than in the significance of her reproach to her husband that he has failed to ""win any fruit"" from her in two and a half years of marriage.Partly because of that take, Johan Reuter’s Barak remains a cipher, if a dependable one. Reuter lacks the nobility of tone which once made Norman Bailey the supreme interpreter of the role and which we might have got from, say, Michael Volle, but comes into his own for the later stages of separation before a reunification of sorts.Bychkov matches the dream logic of the production with well-balanced textures from ever-clear bass clarinet up to piccolo and harp twitter, big expression in the emotional high points and earthy power. Air isn’t quite his element, but that’s a small price to pay for so assured a view of a monstrously difficult score. Crucial cello and violin solos for Emperor and Empress respectively match the quality of the singing.Covent Garden's Jette Parker Young Artists programme has been able to call upon luxurious voices in smaller roles, among them David Butt Philip as the apparitional youth wielded by the Nurse to try and seduce the Dyer's Wife, Anush Hovhannisyan as a plangent Falcon (pictured right with Magee) and Dušica Bijelić as the Keeper of the Threshold urging the Empress to drink the water of life and take the shadow in her ultimate trial. So it’s a real company achievement, already to be notched up as one of the triumphs of a Strauss 150th anniversary year which still needs more surprises beyond the end of a so-far reasonably predictable season. MORE RICHARD STRAUSS ON THEARTSDESKDer Rosenkavalier, Royal Opera (2009).

446,"Le docteur Miracle, Pop-up Opera, The Running Horse",Le docteur Miracle,Pop,2014-03-11,David Nice,"An orchestral musician recently told me that only one per cent of graduates from UK music colleges go on to take up a post in an established opera company or orchestra. You’d think, given such an alarming statistic, that there would be a lot of very good voices floating around trying to drum up work. Young talent is enterprisingly putting itself out there in a new wave of pub or site-specific fringe performances. I’ve shied away from pocket Verdi and Puccini stagings because I really wonder if those operas can take any but the most highly-trained, opulent voices; anything less is selling them short to newcomers, though you might just hit gold. But surely a modest staging of a bagatelle like Bizet’s precocious one act opérette Le docteur Miracle can’t go far wrong, can it?I’m afraid it can. The main problem with Pop-up (or is it Popup? Choices must be made) Opera's latest venture isn’t so much the voices as the slapdash and – to me, at any rate, though others laughed – cringingly unfunny staging. Director Darren Royston lists in his biography past experience as a choreographer and movement director, so he should know better than anyone that in a tiny space, the action has to be taut, decisive, stylized if necessary. Especially if you’re going to give silent-film style captions to the plot which attempt to give a contemporary metatext, and not in a good way, to the French songlines and dialogue.The 18-year old Bizet’s flippant librettists Léon Battu and Ludovic Halévy adapted their most basic of farces from Sheridan’s St Patrick’s Day. It’s pure commedia dell’arte: the Harlequinesque young lover disguises himself first as a factotum in the household of his beloved’s pompous Mayor-father and then, having cooked a disastrous omelette, resourcefully returns as “le Docteur Miracle” to cure a bad case of poisoned Papa: let me marry your daughter, and I’ll let you off the bill for the remedy.Why this should all need a parallel dumb-show of over-semaphored mobile phone and Masterchef references beats me. Young buck Silvio in camped-up cook disguise repels rather than amuses (Christopher Diffey pictured right); the plot has barely got underway before we’re expected to take a 20-minute break while the omelette (or ommelette, as the captioning at one stage has it in mortifying multiplications) is drummed up.What’s the site-specific gimmick, given that the setting is a bourgeois household which could be conjured up in just about any space? You’d have thought some parallel culinary activity involving audience tasters would have done the trick. Sadly there isn't any; only alcohol is available, at least at The Running Horse in Mayfair where I saw the show for one night only. Spectators are infantilized into wearing soldiers’ hats and rattling tambourines and triangles in an interpolated Carmen sequence; later they’re asked to “participate” in a game of Hangman. Fun maybe for playschool, not for anyone who has any experience of operatic sophistication or irony.Helen Bailey takes the limelight with aplomb in the first of three wedding-party encores At least the trios and quartets fizz a little with expert accompaniment from Elizabeth Challenger: the teenage Bizet may not have lavished the melodic gift he shows in the near-contemporary Symphony in C, but it’s an accomplished piece of work. Two of the four singers in the cast I saw did shine at times: Christopher Diffey doesn’t have the high French-tenor ease to take on Nadir’s lovely aria ""Je crois entendre encore"" from The Pearl Fishers as a preludial croon, but otherwise he’s the real article, if lacking in comic charm, while Helen Bailey, who described herself, uniquely in my experience, as a ""Zwischenfach Soprano” but sounds like a perfectly good mezzo, takes the limelight with aplomb in the first of three outrageously grafted-on Carmen wedding-party encores, a stylish Seguidille.Yet this final arbitrary divertissement only points up how young Bizet’s miracle elixir is simply not enough to sustain even a half-evening’s entertainment. Certainly not when the company is hell-bent on pointing up 'Allo 'Allo absurdities with a wit that’s anything but gracious or focused. And since last night’s establishment was asking £40 a ticket, it’s hard to accept the heavy hand with the good will that might have made it bearable.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/le-docteur-miracle-pop-opera-running-horse,2
447,"La Fille du régiment, Royal Opera",La Fille du régiment,Royal Opera,2014-03-04,David Nice,"Roll up, roll up, to hear Juan Diego Flórez deliver his nine cheek-by-jowl top Cs in the umpteenth performance of Laurent Pelly’s slick, often funny Donizetti comedy. Does the whole thing still fizz? Only up to a point in Christian Räth's revival. Yet I’d still rather see this – or Don Pasquale, or L’elisir d’amore – any number of times than endure any more of the composer’s “unjustly neglected” tinpot tragedies.Let’s be fair: Covent Garden’s ever-personable Director of Opera Kasper Holten warned us that Patrizia Ciofi was recovering from a virus. And that may have explained the cloudy middle register if not the spread top of her coloratura high jinks as heroine Marie, a French regiment’s tomboy darling but unfortunately for her also the lost daughter of a once-naughty Marquise. It meant, unfortunately, that there was something of a mésalliance with Flórez’s cut-glass, brilliantined tenor, which six years in the role of her Tyrolean lover has done nothing to diminish. She did at least unfurl her arias of pathos in each act with palpable musicality and style, but it wasn’t quite enough for the icing on an ever so slightly stale and wobbly cake.There’s also the drawback that though Ciofi works overtime on the routine, elle n’a pas [assez] de charme – and charme is what the inimitable creator of the role in this production, Natalie Dessay, had in spades. Flórez gives a brief shot at cute acting as Tonio, the gauche partisan who all too readily deserts his national cause, before stepping to the footlights, looking slightly round-shouldered in his army uniform, to stand and deliver his set pieces. The big number with the Cs, “Pour mon âme”, is infallible and predictably brought the house down; in more sustained legato, the slight bleat intrudes a little.There's little variety in his arias discs, and it’s not a voice I find I can listen to for long, but then in La Fille du régiment one doesn’t have to. Around him a male chorus produces variable quality – near-inaudible in the Act One “Rataplan” chorus – and ham acting, not much helped by the am-dram routines, a bit of a surprise from choreographer Laura Scozzi now that I’ve seen her unique take on Rameau’s Les Indes galantes, but then she’s not working with dancers here.Pietro Spagnoli produces firm, bright baritone tone as Sergeant Sulpice, Marie’s No. 1 regimental “daddy”, but mugs a bit too much; he, too, is short on charme. Whereas star Polish contralto Ewa Podleś (pictured with Spagnoli above) cuts with the trademark redoubtable chest notes and makes us actually like her snobbish Marquise de Berkenfeld in Act Two (and isn’t that her playing the piano in Marie’s unsuccessful music lesson?) Here she comes into her own as a kind of Miss Mapp to the Queen Lucia of la Duchesse de Krakentorp, arrived to offer the still unhousetrained Marie a “respectable” marriage. And regal she is, because Dawn French, Pelly’s first grande Duchesse, is now Kiri te Kanawa, no less (pictured below).Poise she has; breeding, no, because in what I presume is a virtue made out of Kiri’s weird French, La Krakentorp is clearly a Kiwi married in to the European aristocracy. She sings more than a bit, too: namely the arietta “O fior del giorno” from Puccini’s second opera Edgar, an obvious anachronism alongside the Donizetti, but germane to Pelly's pre-WW1 setting. It’s what you might have anticipated from a nearly-70 year old with form (though expect fireworks at Thursday’s birthday performance).Yves Abel start well with the orchestral pastoral of the overture, surprisingly high-quality stuff from Donizetti, but doesn’t generate the last degree of bounce or lilt to the tuneful score (it doesn’t help that Marie’s camp song can’t really become a proper waltz the way it’s staged). It’s still fun enough, and Chantal Thomas’s design of hilly campaign maps, giant dropped-in sentimental postcards and a skeletal stately room lends distinctive visual style, though playing up the realism makes the war-in-Europe comedy a tad distasteful under the present circumstances. Total escapism this isn’t, but it does a good operatic comedy proud. Now it’s time for the Royal Opera to give us a luxuriously cast G&S Pirates of Penzance – then we’d have the wit in the words as well as in the music.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-fille-du-regiment-royal-opera-1,3
448,"Rodelinda, English National Opera",Rodelinda,English National Opera,2014-03-01,David Nice,"If they asked me, I could write a book about the way one number in Richard Jones’s ENO production of Handel’s Rodelinda – the only duet, after 18 arias, and nearly two hours into the action – looks, sounds and moves. Because it doesn’t happen often in opera that all the elements combine for total musical theatre that stuns: in this case, two great voices – Rebecca Evans’s soprano and Iestyn Davies’s countertenor – at what sounds like the peak of their stylish careers, an orchestra under the exceptional Christian Curnyn totally fused with what’s happening on stage, and an ingenious set from Jeremy Herbert, singularly lit by the infallible Mimi Jordan Sherin, that not only does its stuff silently but tear-jerkingly underlines the very core of Jones’ concept.Which is, I take it, that at this point, just when two people really (re)connect, they’re torn apart by the unstoppable vendetta of warring clans. For most of the three acts, six of the seven characters locked in internecine combat are on top of each other. It’s supposed to be the Lombards of Milan, but it feels more like the Camorra of Naples, the ‘Ndrangheta of Calabria or the Sicilian Mafia in a surprisingly deft, even elegant portrayal of blingy, raw and often stupid power struggles, with absurd violence lurking round every jokey corner. Try and escape the family, and you’re walking or running on the spot (three treadmills at the front of the stage). In the inescapable mansion, there are two rooms, an impersonal capo headquarters training its cameras on the grubby cell stage left.How does this work in Handel's favour? Well, it means that whenever one voice is dealing with its da capo aria - and there's an awful lot of setting up with standard numbers in Act One, as usual with the composer - there’s help on hand from the relatives to flesh it out, back it up, contradict: a much better solution than random, distracting action going on in the background, as has so often been the tendency in Handel stagings. So the highlighted singer doesn’t always have to do all the business, though we see Evans’ presumed widow Rodelinda flinging usurper Grimoaldo’s jewels around the room and pouring coffee on a proferred stole; later, John Mark Ainsley as the tyrant urged on by his nasty sidekick to dispatch the husband who’s still alive expertly tackles a bravura aria wielding knife, blowtorch and explosives while he still hesitates to kill his victim.Curnyn sets up a sleek, muscular sound which the classy principals are more than able to emulate, filling the Coliseum with authentic Handelian style and none of the disappearing notes you get with pipsqueak early music singers (I’ve heard too many of those over the past month). Evans, unrecognisable like Ainsley in black wig, the black putative widow to the life, has help from Handel and Amanda Holden’s bold translation from the start but still gives a special kick to Rodelinda's opening “I have lost him”. Here’s a queen of lyric sopranos as lethal matriarch, stunningly abetted by young Matt Casey as her silent but far from passive son Flavio (his mimes of what his mother will do to slimy mafia henchman Garibaldo – Richard Burkhard, a slick operator – when she’s married the master steal the limelight).Ainsley provides wit and even warmth as the inept capo, “Rodelinda” at one point tattooed on his back as well as in his heart, his 1 o'clock pastoral of repentance up there with similar earlier numbers for queen and resurrected victim. And is there a more sheerly beautiful and more musicianly countertenor sound than Iestyn Davies’s, now with added edge and intensity, in Bertarido’s isolated musings? Those have the usual Jones symmetry, adding to the balance of photo-campaigning and weapons of individual destruction: the first is at the foot of Bertarido's fascistic monument in the first act which shatters in the third - Evans, Davies and Ainsley pictured below - while the second is a drink-drowned sorrowful meditation beneath neon gigantism in Act Two's garish bar central, pictured above. Let's also not forget the perfect timing for Steven Williams' two video projections, all the better for their spare use.At first it seemed like a cruel ploy to give Davies a sidekick of similar vocal pitch but lesser tonal lustre. Yet Christopher Ainslie’s Unulfo fulfils some terrific physical demands from Jones and eventually hits vocal silver. There's also a touching moment when he reveals his own name-tattoo to match the others. Last but not least, Susan Bickley's opportunistic bitch sister Eduige manages to keep in vocal focus throughout despite tottering around on high heels. Costume designer Nicky Gillibrand must have had fun with the ladies' frocks.Ultimately, it’s a total team effort, providing image after image you won’t forget. And that duet isn’t the only limelight-holder: see how brilliantly Jones sets up a husband-wife reunion just before it which could have been thrown away in recitative. A first-night audience unusually vocal in its approval for each number was stilled at the end of Rodelinda’s lilting aria: Bertarido throws open her cell door not after, but on, the last chord. Now that’s clever stagecraft. So is one solution to scene-changing which you anticipate drowning out a sensitive repeat. Evans’s last big number, the lament we’ve all been waiting for, moves from quiet heartbreak to mother-son vendetta oath as Curnyn once again swells the bass-rich orchestra to match the soprano’s heroic-dramatic escalation. This, again, is what opera can do that straight theatre can’t, but it rarely happens. ""Sheer genius"" was the buzz word at the second interval, and genius it remains right through to the last outrageous gambit.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/rodelinda-english-national-opera,5
449,"Boulevard Solitude, Welsh National Opera",Boulevard Solitude,Welsh National Opera,2014-02-27,stephen Walsh,"Reviewing WNO’s Manon Lescaut a couple of weeks ago, I suggested that its director, Mariusz Treliński, had devised the production in terms of Henze’s Boulevard Solitude, “and simply tyre-levered the Puccini into it.” QED. Here are the same railway station, the same trains flashing by, the same barman, the same slinky, raincoated – or less – Manons (plural), the same general air of transient sleaze. Boris Kudlička’s designs have changed in detail but not in essence. The one essential difference is that, whereas the idiom was completely unsuited to and effectively shipwrecked Puccini’s version of Prévost’s novel, it fits Henze’s setting like a glove. This show, in a word, is as intriguing as the other was vacuous and dysfunctional.But the main news is Henze’s opera itself. It was his first, composed in the early Fifties in the shadow of post-war Berlin, a time of aimless wandering through still half-ruined streets, and the frenetic search for one or another kind of oblivion. Grete Weil’s libretto filters out the charm of Prévost’s Amiens, and hurries on to a Zola-esque world of high-class whores, loveless sex, drugs, alcohol and murder. It might seem an unpromising – or too promising – mix for an opera. But somehow Henze breathes musical life into it, and without the tendency to droop and drift that came to typify his music after he moved from Germany to Ischia in 1953.Like all German composers after the war, Henze was assailed with influences that had been inaccessible under the Nazis, and it took him a while to sort them out. In his early works Stravinsky, Schoenberg and Hindemith often do battle. But in Boulevard Solitude they’re absorbed into a style that, for want of any better term, one has to call Henzean. Traces of Stravinsky there still are, alongside a kind of post-Bergian lyricism that lies well on the voice; fragments of jazz fly past, Rigoletto is quoted. But beyond all these memories is an individual sensibility that is both modern and approachable, intense yet vibrantly warm and direct.Things that stick in the mind: astonishingly delicate writing for a large percussion section, including a highly original overture that perfectly pre-echoes the uneasy, provisional, somewhat unreal encounter of Manon and des Grieux in the railway station; wonderfully refined woodwind polyphonies and richly coloured string textures; a flow of ideas that never seems in danger of drying up yet never gets overloaded.An unexpected feature of the score is its transparency. Henze had learnt from Stravinsky how to economise in terms of sound, and he understood the importance of interior movement. This is in the best sense body music, full of rhythmic impulse even when slow moving – something that German composers before Henze often found elusive. And it’s this fastidious physicality that maps so well on to a libretto which makes no bones about the sexuality and venality that destroy its heroine in the end. Lothar Koenigs paces it all marvellously, and the orchestral playing is near enough flawless.Treliński predictably makes the most of the physicality. With him movement is a motif, obviously to some extent inspired, like the opera itself, by film: at the start, slow motion (à la Robbe-Grillet) offset by the normal movement of Jason Bridges’ well-drawn des Grieux – the one human being on stage, and the real emotional focus of the opera. Also circling repetition: Lilaque (Henze’s Geronte figure – the elderly lover) murdered twice, Manon – or her double – arrested at the start as well as the finish. In the surreal environment of Henze’s one-acter these devices work well, where they made nonsense of Puccini; and they go with the music. Some may find Treliński’s voyeurism – his toying with the female body – offensive. But it’s hardly out of place in Boulevard Solitude: disturbing no doubt, inappropriate hardly. His obscurities of locale are more bothersome (there are no scene changes, though Henze’s shifts are important). Read the synopsis before curtain-up.The performance is superb down to the smallest role. Bridges, a bookish student in jacket and jersey, sings a nicely focused and eloquent des Grieux, and Sarah Tynan preserves immaculate control while being variously displayed and pawed at by assorted pig-masked sugar-daddies. Benjamin Bevan pulls no punches as Lescaut, an unredeemed villain compared to Puccini’s wastrel; Adrian Thompson (pictured above with Sarah Tynan) is still in fine voice, if a shade too likeable, as Lilaque. Treliński is for some reason obsessed with cleaners: in Manon Lescaut it was the student Edmondo, here des Grieux’s friend Francis (the same character, presumably). Alastair Moore makes an impact vocally, and wields a mean brush and pan. Treliński’s characters may be dirty, but at least his stations are clean. And Henze’s opera is a real find.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/boulevard-solitude-welsh-national-opera,5
450,"The Fairy Queen, Bury Court Opera",The Fairy Queen,Bury Court Opera,2014-02-25,Roderic Dunnett,"Bury Court Opera acquired a pearl of great price when it persuaded Simon Over, music director of the Southbank Sinfonia and the Parliament Choir, to bring his 2010 production of Dido and Aeneas from Anghiari in Tuscany to perform in the beautifully appointed restored old barn just west of Farnham in Hampshire. It proved the launch of an alluring undertaking. Rigoletto, Cenerentola and Onegin followed, plus a clutch of visiting productions, while Over provided leadership that showed in the assurance of his young players.This year it’s the turn of Purcell’s The Fairy Queen. A stellar medley of disparate arias and choruses all shorn of an actual libretto, it requires dazzling invention to form some kind of cogent narrative, if it to have the impact of a Dido. Bury Court has found one - and a responsive cast to match her. Julia Burbach has a CV, as assistant to half the continent’s top directors – above all, Christof Loy. The motivation and precision of her cast is exceptional.She starts with an exceptional wheeze – dangerous, unless it works. She sets the opera in a school, of the St Trinian’s era, and concocts a story full of interweavings, impassioned monologues and tentative eclogues, rearranging the set-pieces to suit. She devises ingenious vignettes, as it were off-camera. To cap it all, Over supplies – whether with delicate or cheerfully bombastic touch - choruses (the leads singing en masse) that sweep you away. His continuo aptly adds enchantment.The academic hurly-burly furnishes huge fun. It allows everyone to be tumbling over one another, but engaged about their detailed duties. The watchful Caretaker (shuffling, sidling, non-singing Jon Shaw) presides over controlled mayhem like a deity. It is a clever conceit, and Burbach’s blocking of the “students” mesmerising: the stage is like an enlarged yet compact kaleidoscope which she filled with event, all relevant textually and emotionally.If everything about this production is brilliant, the cast come near it too. The plum performance is Aidan Smith, the baritone headmaster figure: the timbres of his voice are quite gorgeous. Lilly Pappaionnou (the English Teacher, a reawakening Titania: “No, no, no kissing at all"") is an unusual, old-fashioned mezzo. The girl pupils – Grace Carter, Flore Philis – sing appetisingly throughout. Richard Latham yields one super aria as the Music Teacher, and Helen-Jane Howells half a dozen exquisite ones, all on target, as the Science Teacher.The cast’s enunciation was beyond one’s wildest hopes. There are several other gems. The Sudan-born, RCM-trained Magid El-Bushram, whose disembodied offstage aria (as the others evanesced) is the highlight of the entire performance.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/fairy-queen-bury-court-opera,4
451,"Paul Bunyan, English Touring Opera, Linbury Studio Theatre",Paul Bunyan,English Touring Opera,2014-02-18,Kimon Daltas,"Paul Bunyan, best described as a ""choral operetta"", was Britten’s first foray into the operatic, and much of its value is surely gleaned through the prism of subsequent successes. The composer withdrew it after its poorly received US premiere in 1941, and its rehabilitation didn’t begin until over 30 years later. In its use of American folk and popular music styles, steadfastly melodic score and exploration of Americana, it was almost certainly bidding for a Broadway slot (interesting to imagine a parallel universe where Britten was embraced by the musical theatre world).Despite its appealing music and witty libretto by WH Auden, it remains a problem piece, and hardly a gift to stage directors. Its allegorical storytelling has little forward narrative thrust, and the cast of characters is too large for any one to acquire any significant depth. Paul Bunyan himself, being a mythical giant lumberjack, is represented by a disembodied voice – as a piece of theatre, it suffers many handicaps. This ETO production by Liam Steel cannot entirely transcend these peculiarities, but it is certainly inventive in getting round them, peppering proceedings with what the work as written is missing – action.The single set is a barn in weathered timber – what an estate agent might call a live/work unit – with three-tiered bunks along the side and tools of the lumberjack trade lying around. It is always interesting to see how a production will deal with the Linbury’s limited black-box theatre, and here the orchestra has been placed behind the stage – the slatted barn allowing sound through, though not perhaps with the immediacy one might have wished.Paul Bunyan (a non-singing part) is voiced by a pre-recorded Damian Lewis, of off the telly, and represented on stage by an Uncle Sam hat and a stars 'n' stripes sash, either propped atop a ladder or worn by a member of the cast as a chunk of narration is acted out.In a large and well-balanced cast there are no weak links – a few fluffed lines would hardly have been noticeable if it weren’t for the surtitles. Caryl Hughes as Tiny gets some good solo material and sings it brightly and sensitively. Wyn Pencarreg is an impressive Hel Helson, one of the few characters who have any sort of development, and whose dream sequence marks one of the definite high points of the production – thanks also to the combined efforts of the director, set/costume designer (Anna Fleischle) and lighting designer (Guy Hoare).The band, under conductor Philip Sunderland, swoons, lilts and gambols through the quirky score, but will almost certainly sound better in some of the more conventional theatres on tour in the coming months.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/paul-bunyan-english-touring-opera-linbury-studio-theatre,4
452,"HMS Pinafore, Hackney Empire",HMS Pinafore,Hackney Empire,2014-02-17,David Nice,"Showboys will be boys – gym-bunny sailors, in this instance – as well as sisters, cousins, aunts, captain’s daughters and bumboat women. We know the ropes by now for Sasha Regan’s all-male Gilbert and Sullivan: a loving attempt to recreate, she says, the innocence of musical theatre in same-sex schools (mine, for which I played Sir Joseph Porter with a supporting army or navy of recorders, two cellos and piano, was mixed).This time, the naval high jinks allow Regan to evoke a kind of Privates on Parade scenario, the show-without-the-show set below deck on a World War Two battleship – or so we’re told, though it’s not a great deal clearer than the school dorm context of her Iolanthe. But there nobody minded because the casting and the surprising pathos were perfectly nuanced. Here, what deeper sentiment there is works well in the experienced hands of Alan Richardson’s class-conscious Josephine, but Pinafore is smaller grog than the longer, richer Iolanthe. Two roles are not so strongly taken and the vasts of the Hackney Empire, beautiful as it is, defeat so much of what must have worked so well in the intimate space of the Union Theatre (my fault for not seeing it there).Devotees – and, indeed, newcomers – should be well satisfied by the company routines, neatly choreographed by Lizzi Gee to accompany most of the solos as well as the ensembles; they're so much better than the more-is-less overkill of Scottish Opera's mostly unfunny Pirates of Penzance. Much play is made with a barrier rope: most amusing as Alex Weatherhill’s understated, coy Little Buttercup hints at dark secrets to the Captain Corcoran of Neil Moors, whose ""what never?"" ""hardly ever"" entrance number (pictured above) takes the working-out stuff to brilliantly executed heights. The chorus bifurcates delightfully into sailors and the First Lord’s fluttery entourage in Sullivan’s clever double chorus, and Sir Joseph Porter’s arrival brings with it a show-stealing characterisation of the usually colourless, here much exploited Cousin Hebe by Richard Russell Edwards.The weak links are Aidan Crowley’s way-OTT Dick Deadeye and Keith Jack’s Ralph Rackstraw; the unusually eloquent seaman, an upper-class infant switched with a child of the lower orders by erstwhile baby-farmer Buttercup (I trust no spoiler notice is needed), ought to deliver his poetic speeches to the lass above his station with far more stylised aplomb, and his arietta calls for a sweet tenor, not a straining show voice. Moors is also guilty of belting out what should be a low-key romance at the beginning of Act Two.David McKechnie’s Sir Joseph is a crisp, professional piece of work, though never likeable (and I’m not sure the arselicking political operator who never thought of thinking for himself at all, and never went to sea, is supposed to be). The star, undoubtedly, is Richardson’s daughter of the waves (pictured above with Jack's Ralph), beautifully balanced with deft gestures between sadness and snobbery; and while some of the notes in the hard-working falsetto are inevitably squeezed, he hits the heights with the aplomb of a bravura countertenor.Although Ryan Dawson’s bunk-bed design and Tim Deiling’s lanterns cleverly fill a large stage, and the near-darkness for the attempted elopement of Ralph and Josephine is wittily manipulated, the Empire is no substitute for the intimacy of the Union or even Wilton’s where Iolanthe wrought a special magic. While the mess's resident recorder-player gives a haunting summons and farewell to the let's-put-on-a-show, hard-working Richard Bates’s piano accompaniment sounds tiny even when miked – a second piano is a must, in Hackney at least – and needs more classical zip (only listen to the Mackerras recording). The choruses can be forced. Tour venues, at least, will embrace all shapes and sizes, so do go if your local theatre isn’t too big. If you haven’t seen the Regan Savoy opera style, you’re still bound to be impressed. Me, I'm back to the Union at the first opportunity.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/hms-pinafore-hackney-empire,3
453,"King Priam, English Touring Opera, Linbury Studio Theatre",King Priam,English Touring Opera,2014-02-14,David Nice,"Tippett’s selective, often compelling and mostly well-structured take on Trojan War myths will never capture the wider public’s imagination as much as even the least of Britten’s operas. His ideas sometimes pierce the soul but don’t stick there in the same way, and the human interest level never goes so deep. The sounds, though, are something else: a splintering of interest groups, or even a single instrument, to flank each character.We ought to be gripped by the selective clusters from the opening trumpet fanfares – “heralds before the curtain” – and yowling offstage chorus. James Conway’s production opens not with the fireworks I expected, but with a whimper: brass at the back of the stage, onstage chorus blocking them. It’s the first of many blunders in an almost relentlessly clumsy piece of stagecraft.What would I do? Keep the chorus - and ETO's is superb - in the wings when the original stage directions say so, strike Anna Fleischle’s ungainly set, bring the instrumentalists down to share a third of a bare performing space with the singers, as they did in the Linbury production of Gerald Barry’s dazzling The Importance of Being Earnest, and there’d still be more space for movement.The costumes - all feathers, silly hats and warpaint, as in a bad Star Trek episode - give as much cause for mirth as some of the lines in the libretto. Tippett’s own, it isn’t bad for the most part, but observations like “life is a bitter charade”, with the orginal extra syllable on the ‘-de’ now dropped, occasioned a few giggles among younger audience members, especially when repeated in an increasingly knotty trio for the Old Man (Andrew Slater), Nurse to the baby Paris (Clarissa Meek) and the Young Guard who carries him away to safety (Adam Tunnicliffe). These three have an especially thankless choric task in Tippett’s larger scheme of showing the mystery in human choice.Is that really all it’s about – Priam’s wavering to kill the son the seer tells him will be his death, the resurgent, grown Paris’s choice to go with Helen and give the golden apple to her double Aphrodite (the judgment scene pictured right)? I don’t know and, given Tippett’s schematic characterizations, I didn’t often care. And I don’t want to be told to “feel the pity and the terror” of war if the music, for all its harsh ingenuity, doesn’t make me do so.The vocal phrases are too relentlessly declamatory, in any case. They seemed to be defeating the Priam of Roderick Earle – either exhausted or under the weather (I hate to say it can only get worse as the run progresses). They give promising heroic tenor Charne Rochford a hell of a time as Achilles sits in his tent not so much musing as hollering about his homeland, soulful as the accompanying guitar undoubtedly is. I haven't heard a more uncomfortable rant since Helen Field’s awful Mother in Poul Ruders’ The Handmaid’s Tale at English National Opera.The rest of the cast deals incredibly well both in synchronising with conductor Michael Rosewell and his invisible orchestra - Iain Farrington has given them a reduced instrumentation, though as Tippett's original is so spare, it rarely shows - and in embracing the taxing, tiring lines. Lyric tenor Nicholas Sharratt committed his familiar musicality to the sheer intensity of febrile Paris; he’s a perfectly fine looking chap, but Tippett the librettist should have known better than to advertise him as “the most beautiful man alive"". Paris’s childhood incarnation was impeccably well taken by treble Thomas Delgado-Little, keenly tabbed by oboist Louise Hayter. Grant Doyle kept decent Hector on the boil despite headgear the daftness of which was only matched by Adrian Dwyer’s Hermes. Perhaps if Dwyer had sung a little more softly when the messenger of death waxes lyrical over ""divine music"", we might have believed it, for just a flute and a harp do not sublimity make if the substance isn’t transcendent.Best of all were the women – edgy Hecuba/Athene (strong soprano Laure Meloy) with a solo violin for support as too often (Tippett wanted the full ensemble), seductive cipher Helen/Aphrodite (Niamh Kelly) and above all the most compelling presence and voice in a mostly strong cast, Camilla Roberts as Andromache (pictured above). Unfortunately the ladies' ritual return before Priam’s too long postponed death only highlighted the drama’s dying spasms, and the final inevitable demise was weak.Yet so it is in Tippett’s work too, and though the opera has had more propulsive advocates in David Atherton’s dream cast recording and Nicholas Hytner’s more focused Kent Opera production happily still on DVD, you can’t help remembering that Britten’s War Requiem appeared in the Coventry Festival alongside King Priam back in 1962. The great was the enemy of the good then; so it remains with the passing of time. And there's pity and terror for you.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/king-priam-english-touring-opera-linbury-studio-theatre,2
454,"Rigoletto, English National Opera",Rigoletto,English National Opera,2014-02-14,alexandra Coghlan,"Old sins, the saying goes, cast long shadows. These are nothing, however, to the shadows cast by old productions. Jonathan Miller’s Mafia Rigoletto looms larger than most in this regard – a lowering giant of directorial inspiration, with 30 years in rep and as close to cult status as opera gets. As Christopher Alden’s new Rigoletto made his way through the darkened streets yesterday more than just assassins lurked in the shadows.I say new, but of course this Rigoletto has almost as long and tortured a history as Verdi’s hero. It started life back in 2000 at Chicago’s Lyric Opera. Abandoned after a single run on the insistence of sponsors, it disappeared until 2011 when the Canadian Opera Company and English National Opera decided to resurrect it. Toronto saw the result first, and now – almost 15 years after its premiere – it’s ENO’s turn.At first glance there’s really nothing here to merit the frenzied criticism and cries of betrayal that North American critics have hurled at Alden. The curtain rises on a Victorian gentleman’s club – all palms and oak-panelled walls, lovingly detailed. It’s Zeffirelli, Visconti, and calculated to put opera-goers at their ease. Which is when Alden pulls the Persian carpet out from under them.Instead of a straight relocation to Verdi’s own 1850s we get a stylized (and, it must be said, stylish) social exegesis, with what might or might not be a memory play thrown in for good measure. There are so many ideas ricocheting around the production’s single room that the result keeps battering you to think when Verdi’s music is pleading with you to feel.Foremost in Alden’s thoughts are social networks of power. His gentleman’s club (which could just as easily be an army barracks or a corporate board room) mirrors a score in which there’s no female chorus. Women enter the action of Rigoletto only as silent adjuncts – wives, daughters, servants – to be raped and discarded, we are reminded. But by picking this era Alden gets a rather intrusive set of ready-made illustrations.A Mrs Rochester-esque woman (later revealed as Monterone’s daughter) darts wildly around the room in her petticoat – the mad woman in Victorian art’s attic let out to play. Sprawled across a sofa among all the suited male figures, she also bears more than a passing resemblance to André Brouillet’s notorious painting Une leçon clinique à la Salpêtrière, in which a young women slumps half-dressed, a human teaching aid in a room of medical students. It’s unfortunate that Stephen Langridge’s I Puritani at Grange Park has so recently mined this particular seam for effect, perhaps dulling me to Alden’s careful blurring of public and private, his claustrophic collapse of Rigoletto’s world and the Duke’s kingdom into a single room, always filled with observers.Symbolically it works. Rigoletto’s self-deception is painted in every bar of Verdi’s music, in the stylistic lurches from his “Cortigiani” railings to his softness with Gilda. These are two worlds that cannot co-exist discretely and must eventually blur and bleed into one another, just as Alden demands in his direction of Hawaiian baritone Quinn Kelsey (pictured above).Unfortunately technically the single set throws up problems. A veil-curtain often falls between Rigoletto and the action. Whether this is sleep or memory or yet another deferral is unclear, but it leads to long pauses in the action while shufflings and set-shiftings go on behind him. Between Act I Scenes I and II you just can’t afford this if the dramatic screw isn’t to lose all its tension. It also gives the opera little to play for. If we know we’re watching a memory, a story already played out, then there’s nothing at stake – none of that sense we get in the score of a drama inventing and reinventing itself structurally as we watch.The principal fascination for Verdi in tackling Victor Hugo’s Le roi s’amuse was the character of the jester. In Quinn Kelsey, Alden has a singing actor eminently capable of carrying the composer’s close psychological scrutiny. Singing with a looseness, almost a roughness, he makes Verdi’s ferociously high writing sound completely instinctive, conversational (if that conversation has been scripted by Shakespeare). It’s a performance worth going back a second time for.By contrast, Barry Banks’ Duke is polished and pretty. Like a too-skilled bassoonist tackling The Rite of Spring, he finds an ease to it that perfectly suits a character who doesn’t go in much for endeavour. He is matched for quality by Peter Rose’s Sparafucile. A world away from the spivvish take on him we’ve often seen from Brindley Sherratt, Rose is bluff and grandfatherly – an assassin with a code of honour and low notes as magnificent as his beard. Soprano Anna Christy (pictured above) was such a natural fit for the cold passion of Britten’s Tytania, but I struggle to find Gilda’s innocent warmth in her characterisation. Vocally she suits the role well, projecting nicely in the quartet and spinning an elegant if rather unmoving “Caro nome”.None of the singers were greatly helped by Graeme Jenkins’ rather haphazard conducting. There’s pace and direction here, but last night too few speeds had settled and there was a lot of tugging between stage and pit.There’s no denying the thought Alden has put into his Rigoletto. I haven’t even mentioned the onstage hanging of Monterone, the Giovanna who may or may not be Gilda’s mother, or the perplexing physical relationship between Gilda and her father. But I wonder if his vision of the opera really is shared with Verdi? This is a revolutionary work that casts aside the traditional structures of ottocento opera and discovers a new music-drama. It’s not a play about society, it’s about the psychology that society creates – the freewheeling, tragi-comic, rule-breaking humanity that can’t be contained in stand-alone arias and choral finales. And this is what Alden’s wide-shot Rigoletto lacks. We never get close enough to feel, and in so smart a show that’s the real tragedy.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/rigoletto-english-national-opera,3
455,"Manon Lescaut, Welsh National Opera",Manon Lescaut,Welsh National Opera,2014-02-09,stephen Walsh,"As before, WNO have a theme for their new opera season: this time it’s Fallen Women, a topic that might well attract the attention of the Equal Opportunities Commission. Surely men have the right to fall as well; we await, in June, The Fall of the House of Usher, a much fairer piece than Puccini’s Manon Lescaut, which opened the company’s winter season in a new production by the Polish director Mariusz Treliński. In Debussy’s Usher brother and sister both fall, and the house falls on top of them.Treliński is in any case much taken with the theme. Not only is his Manon (Chiara Taigi) already fallen when she first appears in a red plastic raincoat and dark glasses, a gangster’s moll to the life, but by the last act he has two fallen Manons, both very much alive and kicking but still falling. Poor Des Grieux (Gwyn Hughes Jones) doesn’t know which way to turn, and nor perhaps do the audience. In between, whole processions of fallen women pass in review, culminating in the prostitutes with whom Manon is being transported to America, all dressed (if that’s not too strong a word) like strippers in a fairly advanced state, their hands tied high above their heads, their abject humiliation in direct contradiction of Puccini’s stage direction, which has them saucy, nonchalant and laughing.There is other evidence of Treliński’s somewhat dubious taste in male voyeurism, and more or less continuous evidence of his contempt for the verbal and musical text he’s supposed to be presenting to his eager public. When this slinky Manon reveals that she is about to take the veil, one checks one’s programme for a possible error. Then the penny drops. Puccini’s opera is being run in tandem with another piece loosely based on Prévost’s novel, Henze’s Boulevard Solitude, in which Manon is indeed a cigarette-smoking slag and Des Grieux goes druggy. If you assume that Treliński, who is directing both operas, has devised his Henze and simply tyre-levered the Puccini into it, you’ll get some flavour of the perversity and stylistic dysfunctionality of this wretched show.Leaving aside the libretto's specific 18th-century settings, which are anyway semi-contradicted by Puccini’s richly textured late 19th-century score, we’re left with a depressing repertoire of directorial clichés. Where else have we seen these dark-spectacled, black suited and brief-cased zombie executives masquerading as an opera chorus? Or these rectangular black-and-white sliding screens and whizzing city lights and back projections; this permanent airport lounge, whether a square in Amiens or a Paris mansion or a Le Havre prison (to say nothing of the Louisiana desert: just imagine dying of thirst in Terminal 5 – but then, precisely, Treliński’s Manon doesn’t really die at all). Boris Kudlička and Magdalena Musial designed all this, but they might as well have bought it second-hand on Amazon, for all the relevance it has to this soaring music. As for the warmth and human intricacy of Prévost’s heroine, torn between the need to be loved and the desperate attachment to material possessions, you might as well forget them.Musical virtues remain, though they do not consistently shine. Hughes Jones (pictured right by Johan Persson) is a vocally stylish if slightly reedy Des Grieux but an inert actor; Taigi slinks well and has the figure for it, but the voice lacks real colour throughout the range, and the director makes sure her presence is charmless. David Kempster is a strong Lescaut, though unable to make much of his volatile character. Stephen Richardson plays Geronte convincingly if disagreeably as a high-class trafficker in (fallen) women, re-emerging unexpectedly in the third act as the ship’s captain. The chorus is excellent as ever, students no more but faceless middle management, and their chief spokesman, the amiable Edmondo (Simon Crosby Buttle), is ludicrously recast as a kind of clairvoyant airport-cleaner, who sees everything and cleans nothing.The main saving grace, however, is some superb orchestral playing, eloquently masterminded by Lothar Koenigs. Some dodgy ensemble can be partly attributed to Treliński’s frequently unhelpful upstage placings. He must have hoped that distance would lend enchantment. It doesn’t.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/manon-lescaut-welsh-national-opera,1
456,"Don Giovanni, Royal Opera",Don Giovanni,Royal Opera,2014-02-04,David Nice,"If you don’t believe in the angels, or at least the good, of Don Giovanni, don’t stage it. Mozart may well be telling us, as Kasper Holten partly seems to be, that the antihero is a void, a mask-wearer and a creature of thrusting appetites, on his way to the abyss. But he also gives the young avengers, bent on punishing the libertine for his murder of Donna Anna’s father, music of such diamond-cut beauty that only someone bent on the text alone would ignore its force (whether we happen to be more compelled, dramatically speaking, by the rake’s enigma is irrelevant). To shed all but the last of the final six minutes, sung behind the impenetrable wall which shuts off the protagonist from an already unreal world, isn’t an option – least of all when you have six fine singers to make it work.Holten starts unacceptably, too, in my books: whatever went on behind the door between Giovanni and Anna – and I see no reason, along with Deborah Warner whose Glyndebourne production remains a benchmark for me, why Anna should be lying about attempted rape – the music’s vital energy doesn’t tie in with post-coital contentment. Everything that happens between that and the no-hell-for-the-antihero in this production has moments of insight and always looks good as Luke Hall’s endlessly resourceful video projections illuminate the centre-stage revolving rectangle crucial to Es Devlin’s designs. But it hovers uneasily between realism – including a messy Act One party finale – and brainsick fantasy (the realm of Act Two).There’s the usual problem of over-design in that the characters and their relationships are dwarfed by the psycho-visuals – a problem which may be partially solved in the livescreening. This is the sort of thing that only La Fura des Baus can get away with, and then only under special circumstances (Tristan und Isolde in Lyon, Le Grand Macabre at ENO). Why diminish Mariusz Kwiecień (pictured above with Malin Byström's Donna Anna), possibly the best singer-actor available for the impossible protagonist’s role, in this way? He’s handsome and charismatic and can sing the first three and a half bars of “Là ci darem la mano” in a single seductive line – a blandishment replicated elsewhere, under the supportive baton of Nicola Luisotti, that Malin Byström’s Donna Anna and Antonio Poli’s Don Ottavio replicate elsewhere.Yet Kwiecień pushes Giovanni’s manic-depressive final stages too far. Similarly Elizabeth Watts, vocally a dream Zerlina, flounces around dementedly from the start (the wedding scene pictured left) and there’s lots of unattractive rasping in trying-too-hard recitatives from Alex Esposito’s Leporello, whose Catalogue Aria is an apogee of unfunniness (though people laughed at the supertitles). Byström is even more of a vocal goddess than Watts, making the thrust of “Or sai che l’onore” absolutely thrilling even as Holten seems determined to expose it, along with the preceding narrative, as a lie, and Poli does Italianate honour to both his arias even if he can’t act and isn’t asked to.Only the glamorous Véronique Gens as a grand Elvira falters slightly at her final hurdle. “Mi tradì”, which from a purist’s point of view needn’t appear - along with ""Dalla sua pace"" it was an inspired addition to the Vienna production after the Prague premiere - can’t flow as limpidly as it should given Gens' fast vibrato which activates her character elsewhere. The alternative recitative before it, which I hadn't heard before, is at least no less moving than the more familiar one. Dawid Kimberg's Masetto is, as often, a bit of a cipher and Alexander Tsymbalyuk's Commendatore bleats too much to terrify as the stone guest.Luisotti’s fortepiano recit accompaniments are either flamboyant or self-indulgent, according to taste, but he mostly has the right fingers on the pulse of the score. Unfortunately the orchestra sounded dullish from where I was sitting: blame the stalls circle overhang which affects the acoustic impression from the second row back. But I couldn’t succumb to passing enchantments given what Holten was up to, or not.His production is certainly an improvement on the last at the Royal Opera, Zambello’s vulgar waxworks show, and it has its moments – not least a giddying realisation of the great Act Two Sextet (pictured above) and a romantic ache expressed by this Giovanni when enviously watching Zerlina and Masetto in love or showing up in Anna’s last aria (this Ottavio, as too often, never stood a chance). But given that I was in the minority who believed in the human heart of Holten’s Tchaikovsky Eugene Onegin – and it works even better on DVD – this came as a hellish descent.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/don-giovanni-royal-opera-0,3
457,"Acis and Galatea, Mid Wales Opera, Cardiff",Acis and Galatea,Mid Wales Opera,2014-01-31,stephen Walsh,"Handel’s “little opera”, as he called Acis and Galatea when he was composing it in 1718, probably survived while his true, full-length operas vanished from sight precisely because it was little, compact and manageable, like Purcell’s Dido or Pergolesi’s Serva padrona. But little isn’t the same as easy; and these days a production like the one with which Mid Wales Opera is celebrating its 25th anniversary can find itself asking more questions than it can readily answerOn the face of it it’s an utterly competent, workable, musicianly show, perfectly adapted to the touring that is MWO’s chief raison d’être. Nicky Shaw has devised a clever, foldaway Arcadian box set, bang ready to be forklifted from the Royal Welsh College’s Richard Burton Theatre on to the lorry. The design itself may be more Jacquie Lawson than Fragonard, but never mind. With the orchestra stage left (as it will have to be in some other pitless tour venues), director Annelese Miskimmon has to manoeuvre her cast tidily within the frame of the box, using hidden doors and windows and much coming and going round the edges. The young singers are uniformly good, nice-looking, stylish; the orchestra (Rachel Podger’s Brecon Baroque) is superfine. Nicholas Cleobury conducts crisply and with energy.Yet with all these virtues the piece drags. Acis and Galatea, it seems, is a more complicated work than its rather dull dramaturgy might suggest. After all, not much happens. Demi-goddess loves shepherd boy, happy they (end of Act I). Enter the cyclops Polyphemus, in love with demi-goddess, and, violent because disappointed, drops boulder on shepherd. Sad Galatea turns dead shepherd into fountain. Curtain.What’s missing from this cod synopsis is the element of sensuality, which turns, with the arrival of Polyphemus, into a wistful, rustic pathos. Without the sexiness, to put it bluntly, the first act is nothing but pretty melodies too much repeated. And without a certain stylised coarseness, the Polyphemus scenes fall flat. But the Galatea, Jane Harrington, is about as flirtatious as a country housewife, while Matthew Stiff’s Polyphemus, togged up more like Old King Cole than an Ovidian monster, prompts not a shudder.Both sing beautifully, but need more incisive, focused directing. Likewise Oliver Mercer’s smoothly delivered Acis and the alert, agile Damon of Eamonn Mulhall. All need to study how to move; and to be fair, they need more space to move in. Why, when confronted with the certainty of small stages, do directors invariably concoct sets that occupy such space as there is? Handel, like nearly all baroque music, is dance as well as song, and sex is distance as well as closeness, loss as well as gain. These things call for movement and separation. And the same might be said of the performance itself. Cleobury is a very fine conductor, but his pacing here is sometimes unhelpful; it has polish but not much urgency, one exquisite piece after another, but not too much conflict. Of course, Acis isn’t essentially about conflict. But, even as pocket tragedy, it can’t do without it altogether.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/acis-and-galatea-mid-wales-opera-cardiff,3

459,"The Girl of the Golden West, Opera North",The Girl of the Golden West,Opera North,2014-01-22,graham Rickson,"Puccini’s unlikely Spaghetti Western still convinces in Aletta Collins’ vivid new production. The incongruities in this uneven yet powerful work aren’t dodged but embraced. Most of them are musical: the sheer delight, for instance, of seeing stage action which occasionally resembles a jerky early Western played out to rich, blazing orchestral sonorities.Disappointingly, the honky tonk piano in the corner of the Polka Saloon is never heard. You giggle as the stage lights come on behind Giles Cadle’s witty curtain, the shadows shifting from left to right as an ominous-hatted silhouette appears. The Polka Saloon scenes work well, Opera North’s male chorus members convincingly decked out in a pleasing range of false beards and moustaches. Initially they’re funny – jostling one another at the bar to order straight whiskies, but coalescing at the drop of a ten-gallon hat to form a menacing, Grimesian mob.There are several striking individual performances – Eddie Wade’s Sonora is nicely characterised and beautifully sung, while Bonaventura Bottone as bartender Nick has a delicious extended solo at the start of the last act. Your eyes are quickly drawn to Callum Thorpe’s isolated Billy Jackrabbit, forever excluded, always pushed to the side.Musically it's stunning. Richard Farnes cleverly manages to make one of Puccini’s boldest operas sound satisfyingly loud whilst never overwhelming the voices, and revels in the score’s cosmopolitan modernity. At several points it’s as if you’re listening to mature Ravel. The wittier details are nicely pointed, particularly the clip clop rhythms heralding the entrance of the Wells Fargo man sung by Graeme Danby.The shortcomings are largely dramatic. Robert Hayward’s Jack Rance looks the part and sings well, but frequently appears ill at ease, standing awkwardly on stage. Vocally, Alwyn Mellor sounds perfect in the key role of saloon owner Minnie, but her scenes with Rance often feel stilted. Best is Rafael Rojas’s Dick Johnson – an engaging stage presence, a rogue you’re willing to forgive. Alas, the dramatic central act, set entirely in Minnie’s snowbound mountainside cabin (pictured above), comes uncomfortably close to farce at several points, particularly when Johnson has to hide in a wardrobe or shimmy up a rickety ladder to the attic. The closing poker game borders on the ludicrous, despite Hayward's and Mellor’s best efforts.Collins’s last act redeems the evening – a magnificently choreographed, emotionally charged climax. The mens’ preparation for Johnson’s execution (pictured left) is deeply unsettling and you’re ready to believe that it’ll go ahead. Minnie’s dramatic entrance, and her pleading for her lover’s survival is powerfully done, and the pair’s exit is fully deserved. And it’s to Puccini’s credit that the work closes not in a blaze of redemptive sunlight but quietly, thoughtfully. Kathryn Walker’s Wowkle adds a refreshing touch of sweetness in her Act 2 cameo. The production is superbly lit by Andreas Fuchs, and Cadle’s realistic sets look and feel exactly right.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/girl-golden-west-opera-north,4
460,"Manon, Royal Opera",Manon,Royal Opera,2014-01-15,Sebastian Scotney,"Massenet had just two lingering thoughts about Manon when he wrote his memoirs in 1910, a quarter-century after the opera's first performance. First, he enjoyed reminding himself how many times it had been performed (a staggering 763 by the time he finished the memoirs). He also stressed that the choice of the singer to play Manon herself was crucial, needing an ""artist who suited this role just as I wanted, and who could represent perfidious and dear Manon with all the heart that I had placed in her,"" with the right ""qualities of vocal seduction"".In both these respects, this Covent Garden revival of Laurent Pelly's production is swimming against the tide. Manon is not the box office draw it once was. The performances in this run are also all on weekdays, they start at 6.30pm, and finish a few minutes short of four hours later. Furthermore, the original run's star soprano Anna Netrebko - around whom the production, shared with New York, Milan and Toulouse, and first heard here in 2010, was built - has left the cast, and been replaced on this run by two less well-known singers, the Albanian Ermonela Jaho for the first five performances, then American Ailyn Pérez for the last two.Jaho (pictured right) received a very warm accolade at the end of the show from the opening night house, but in solo passages occasionally sounded as if she were ""marking"" the part for a rehearsal rather than fully singing out. Only towards the end did I get the sense that she was connecting with the audience.The production doesn't help communication. Laurent Pelly has talked about the detached perspective he likes to bring to everything he does, saying in an interview that ""the critical gaze is always the backdrop to my creations"" and that ""I look at the world and at people through that filter and hold it up to the public as a mirror."" That approach of distancing a creation has its limitations with a work which wears its heart on its sleeve. Characters are disappearing where they should be imposing themselves. Was it my imagination, or was American tenor Matthew Polenzani often required to walk backwards and upstage?Among the minor roles, two in particular left a strong impression: Alastair Miles as Des Grieux (senior) was not just in fine voice; he brought a sureness of touch to every phrase. Christophe Mortagne played the demanding character part of Guillot with panache. His progression during the evening from a ridiculous buffo, you're-not-kidding-anyone suitor through to an implacable man seeking vengeance by the end was expertly handled.Chantal Thomas's designs, evoking the Belle Époque, the time of the opera's composition, and reminiscent of the Parisian paintings of Jean Béraud, are beautiful. The approach is historically coherent too. There is a lot of Zola's Rougon-Macquart in general, and of Nana (published in 1880, four years before Manon) in particular, in Meilhac and Gille's view of the world in their adaptation of Abbé Prevost's novel.The final scene looks to be set anachronistically on an airport runway, but the desolation works well. Jorge Lavelli used to pull off that effect expertly, letting the bleakness of an empty stage home the audience's attention in on the lonely plight of the protagonists.I have to say that one other anachronism completely infuriated me: Pelly and Thomas have made the dress, the pout and the gesturing of Act IV Scene 1 into a shameless, direct lift from Madonna's Material Girl video of 1984. That, surely, is a misjudgment.The orchestra under conductor Emmanuel Villaume was having a very good night indeed. Perfect woodwind tuning, balance and shaping are not things which a listener can or should ever take for granted on a first night. Villaume also gives himself and his singers plenty of freedom and allows phrase length to flow, to follow rhetoric and gesture, rather than trying to assert a pulse. The slower passages hinting at Rameau and Lully were brought out quite beautifully. The climaxes at the end of scenes grew inexorably, with the one at the end of Act III Scene 2 stupendous. The chorus (pictured above) were also on fine form, though the production ensured they received embarrassed rather than appreciative applause when the octet of female ballet dancers was bodily removed, legs beating in the air, by men in suits, to an uncertain fate.This was a solid performance, though with enough of the virtues and high standards of the Royal Opera company on display to make a worthwhile evening. There will be seats to spare, indeed some discounting has aleady started. I was picking up more of a buzz about the prospect of Ailyn Pérez taking up the role later in the run, by which time orchestra and chorus will no doubt also be reaching the heights.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/manon-royal-opera-0,3

462,Classical and Opera 2013: A Year of Anniversaries,Classical and Opera 2013: A Year of Anniversaries,,2013-12-28,David Nice,"Which musical calendar year isn’t laden down with composer commemorations, too often a pretext for lazy and unimaginative planning? The last 12 months, with Verdi, Wagner and Britten as the birthday boys (in case you failed to hear), have raised the stakes.It looked on paper as if the BBC Proms were going for the obvious: all the major Wagner operas except The Flying Dutchman and The Mastersingers in semi-staged versions.The execution exceeded everyone’s wildest hopes (there, I’ve snuck in a collective top choice already). Now, it seems, is the time when opera is becoming the designer’s provenance, clutter overwhelms clarity and the crucial one-to-ones of Wagnerian music-drama, the personenregie as another useful German compound noun has it, can all too easily be overlooked. Semi-staging director Justin Way’s practical framework and the bonding of great singers used to working with each other pulled into focus what I, at least, really want from the Wagnerian experience – and that comes from a fierce defender of the full experience against knee-jerk traditionalists who wonder why we have productions when opera in concert seems to work so well (below, Daniel Barenboim's speech to the audience at the end of his Proms Ring cycle, photo by Chris Christodoulou).While Verdi did much less well in the UK - a keenly anticipated Sicilian Vespers at the Royal Opera House delivered only on some fronts - the Britten 100 experience capped the lot. Sure, you could suffer from overkill if you were tuned exclusively to Radio 3, but otherwise you could take your pick, hear works unfamiliar to you – and in the enormous output of our greatest composer after Elgar, another devoted internationalist, there was always going to be something – and choose to follow all or any of the operas (how very satisfying, for example, that in London or thereabouts this autumn you could go from Paul Bunyan to Albert Herring via Peter Grimes and The Rape of Lucretia in chronological sequence). Funding from the Britten Estate and careful planning helped, and children up and down the country performed music that would usually be deemed too difficult, just as the composer had always intended: his blueprint for education may at last be coming back into fashionEarly music fans were well catered for, as usual, in a host of festivals, but it was the 20th century path selectively followed by Alex Ross in his phenomenally successful and wide-reaching book The Rest is Noise, opened out to a large and predominantly youthful audience at the Southbank, which proved the smash hit of the year. From the closing scene of Strauss's Salome and Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius to John Adams’s El Niño, much of it was mainstream but as we moved into the post-1945 era the juxtapositions became ever more outlandish and astonishing. With attendance never falling below the 1800 mark, a new listenership had been hooked. Can the concert world now manage to build on that?Here three of theartsdesk’s classical and opera team reflect on a real cornucopia of a year: Alexandra Coghlan and I look at the live scene, while Graham Rickson – who has also caught the ongoing high standards of Opera North in Leeds – picks the best of his CD listening year. ALEXANDRA COGHLANMy classical 2013 has been more than usually dominated by opera, but looking back very few of its highlights have come from the obvious sources. For every high profile Sunken Garden that fell flat (a serious contender for my dud of the year) there have been a handful of quirkier offerings that have genuinely provoked and delighted. My ears are still squirming at the memory of Sciarrino’s vocal writing in The Killing Flower, staged by Music Theatre Wales at the Linbury. At once utterly original and instinctively natural, these extraordinary melody-convulsions were a revelation. MTW had the stand-out season of the year, pairing the Sciarrino with a revival of Turnage’s Greek. The ferocity and wit of the composer’s early work hit harder than ever, and I can’t have been the only one yearning for the composer to recapture his angry young man energy and reclaim his place as the Tony Harrison of classical music.In Britten’s anniversary year there were always going to be some stand-outs, and none more so than the insanely ambitious Grimes on the Beach (rehearsal pictured above for the BBC by Robert Workman). Site-specific can surely never have been as literal as these performances of Britten’s masterpiece in the landscape and on the very shingle that rustles and pulses through the music. The wind howled and the North Sea chilled, but it only added to the heart-swelling intensity of it all.  Glyndebourne’s revival of the Michael Grandage Billy Budd was another reminder that sometimes tradition and simplicity can trump technological innovation, generating tremendous tension and emotion from Britten’s difficult opera. A concert performance of The Turn of the Screw by Richard Farnes and the LSO completed my triptych of top Britten, with Andrew Kennedy delivering a controlled and magnificently chilling performance as Peter Quint, and particularly exquisite playing from the wind. Another concert-performance opera that impressed was Ex Cathedra’s Late Night Prom. Reprising their 2012 staging of Stockhausen’s Mittwoch aus Licht, the group gave us the lively Welt-Parlament section, persuading a casual Proms crowd to engage with this bit of musical madness, delivering one of the most technically precise and dramatically lively evenings of the year. Opera didn’t have it all its own way though. At the Wigmore Hall the first concert of period ensemble L’Arpeggiata’s residency (the group pictured left) had me eager for the second and third, getting a staid crowd dancing and tapping to their infectious rhythms and riffs. There’s nothing starchy or precious about this early music group, who bring the best of world, folk and classical music together in joyous fusion. If I had to pick one event though to top all others, it would have to be my first live experience of the Music For Youth Schools’ Prom at the Royal Albert Hall. This massive event, stretched across three nights, showcases the skills of children from across the country, ranging from 7-year-olds with their 1/14-size violins and recorders, to polished pop acts from teenagers. Our X-Factor age has devalued all superlatives, but these kids were truly magnificent – confident, happy, creative, and above all loving making music. And that’s what it’s all about really, isn’t it? Whether you are Daniel Barenboim or a Grade 2 clarinettist – if we don’t feel the joy, then no amount of technique can compensate. DAVID NICEToo many choices here, but what the hell – it’s been a phenomenal year. A is for Adams, John (pictured below by Kevin Leighton), who provided a beginning, a middle and an end. Even before the Southbank’s festival of 20th century music had begun, the Barbican was fighting back with a miniresidency from the composer as much-improved, bendy-kneed conductor. The three concerts revealed to me the beauty of the great American’s Debussy arrangements – with perhaps his favourite soprano, Dawn Upshaw, still on fine form – the exultation of Shaker Loops with the LSO Strings at St Luke's alongside the complexity of his String Quartet which sent me in pursuit of a score and time to absorb it and the comedy-with-depths of his Beethoven homage Absolute Jest.At passion time came the daring new leaps into the dark of Adams' latest epic, The Gospel According to the Other Mary, where Peter Sellars’ familiar semaphoring felt meaningful as his original visual overload for the nativity oratorio El Niño at the time of its 2000 premiere had not. Come December, Vladimir Jurowski's magnificently cast but image-chaste performance took measure of the work's purely musical greatness and decided it for me: another Adams masterpiece, no doubt about it.The comparison with Britten’s fertility and dangerous drive to cover new territory is beginning to seem not too hyperbolic. Certainly Adams is the only composer until this year who, in my experience, has written an opera I've experienced at, or close to, its premiere so obviously destined to last (Nixon in China back in 1986; James MacMillan’s The Sacrifice as well as a couple of Turnage stage works merit an honourable mention). Adès is often cited as Britten's true successor, but no way, as yet, for me, and George Benjamin’s Written on Skin was my biggest disappointment this year: refined musical language, yes, and first-class realization, but lumpy, often repetitive pacing which led to a denouement about which I couldn’t care less. The cold characterizations in a horrid story with a risible libretto by Martin Crimp nailed the coffin shut fairly fast; though others vehemently disagree. Whereas I cried with laughter at the plate-smashing pièce de resistance of Gerald Barry’s endlessly resourceful The Importance of Being Earnest and enjoyed the contemporary Linbury staging (pictured below by Stephen Cummiskey) alongside a razor-sharp orchestra rife with Stravinskyan punch in wind and brass more than my colleague Igor Toronyi-Lalic, who’d been lucky enough to see the Barbican premiere.Conversely to the Skin experience, I warmed to Kasper Holten’s emotionally intelligent Royal Opera take on Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin where others found only artifice and obscurity; seeing the recently released DVD confirmed the hold it had on me, and Robin Ticciati’s conducting seemed more settled and nuanced. Ticciati's partnership with Mitsuko Uchida in Mozart, followed by an original take on Dvořák's Fifth Symphony, fulfilled the promise of an Enigma Variations and had me hoping that he, and not the much-touted Rattle, might take over the London Symphony Orchestra reins from Gergiev (the jury's still out). But the Elgar was only half of a concert which had earlier seen Vengerov go badly off piste in the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto, and some of my other highlights this year have stood out in curate’s-egg programmes: Yannick Nézet-Séguin’s deeply felt, supple ideals of Prokofiev interpretation in the Fifth Symphony with the Rotterdam Philharmonic at the Proms and the Seventh with the LPO later at the Festival Hall.Perfect all through, on the other hand, were Stephane Denève’s French programme with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, getting a difficult Poulenc ballet suite exactly right, at least half thanks to narration by the brilliant Stephen Mangan, before culminating in a student-led Ravel L’enfant et les sortilèges, and above all Vladimir Jurowski's father, German-based Michail, giving what he regarded as his proper UK debut with the delirious but cumulative-impact collage wildness of Schnittke’s First Symphony. That was my biggest discovery in a year of hearing so many works in concert for the first time. The event - perhaps ""happening"" was more like it - also made me sit up and listen afresh to a work I thought I didn't care for, Lutosławski's Cello Concerto, in an electrifying theatrical narration by the extraordinary Johannes Moser.I hadn’t even heard Britten’s Noyes Fludde live before; its Tewkesbury Abbey performance designed and part-directed by the brilliant and musically astute children’s illustrator James Mayhew culminated in an ensemble of Wagnerian breadth.The context, a pioneering Cheltenham Music Festival, was the first to give another anniversary boy, Poulenc, his proper due. Britten's Gloriana I’d seen a few times before, but not as Richard Jones imagined it in a perfectly followed-through new concept at Covent Garden. I may not have got to Aldeburgh this year, but I could hardly regret missing the centenary weekend in Britten’s home town when in London there was probably the best-cast Albert Herring ever: not a flaw in the gallery of the grotesque and the deeply human revolving around Andrew Staples’ great comic turn as the greengrocer’s boy who busts out.It’s tempting just to reel off a list of great performers: among quartets the Jerusalem and Belcea, commanders of fire and ice both (and I’m grateful to the Belceas for making me fall head over heels in love with Britten’s First Quartet); among singers soprano Anne Schwanewilms making Schumann's Op. 39 Liederkreis my favourite song-cycle - and another Strauss-centric diva, Renée Fleming, was at her silvery best in his last opera Capriccio; among pianists Imogen Cooper, Yevgeny Sudbin, Boris Giltburg, Boris Berezovsky, Daniil Trifonov and above all a revelatory debut from the brilliantly-programming contemporary champion Mei Yi Foo (pictured above by Kaupo Kikkas); and Lisa Batiashvili supreme among violinists, plumbing the depths of Sibelius’s Violin Concerto with Sakari Oramo at the Proms. But unquestionably the greatest star of them all, shedding her years and her infirmity as she ran the gamut of Broadway, cabaret and Cabaret alike, was Liza Minnelli, again courtesy of The Rest is Noise festival. As we ended up standing for number after number in, who’d have thought it, the Festival Hall, I was delighted that Vladimir Jurowski in the seat next but one to me was as enthusiastic as anyone. Great artistry comes in any shape or form, and putting across a song doesn’t come more dynamic than that. GRAHAM RICKSONI began listing candidates for an end-of-year ""best of"" among the CDs of 2013 months ago, and reducing the shortlist to manageable proportions has been tough. In amongst the endless reissues, the disturbingly cheap box sets and the naff crossover discs, there’s a huge amount of interesting material still being released. The independent labels continue to be the boldest, and it’s reassuring that people still seem prepared to buy physical CDs, rather than soulless downloads. Recorded music will never be a substitute for live performance, but the experience will be more potent if you listen to CDs the old-fashioned way - through decent  loudspeakers, sat on a comfy sofa.  Not as an MP3 file, through cheap headphones or on a car stereo.My favourite CD of the year remains the Mythos Accordion Duo’s remarkable transcription of Stravinsky’s Petrushka (disc pictured left), so bold and colourful that you can’t imagine needing to hear the orchestral version again. I also enjoyed Sergio Tiempo and Karin Lechner’s scintillating, theatrical reading of Federico Jusid's Tango Rhapsody – arguably not great music, but heard (and seen on the bonus DVD) in a great performance. Antonio Pompa-Baldi playing  idiomatic piano transcriptions of songs by Edith Piaf and Poulenc was a delight, and Hindemith’s sublime Christmas fairy tale Tuttifäntchen was an unexpected surprise, one which a colleague deemed worthy of compare with Humperdinck’s Hansel and Gretel. An equally arresting discovery was a long-forgotten Cinderella ballet score by the Swiss composer Frank Martin – a fascinating alternative to the better-known Prokofiev version.In a year full of new Britten releases, the pick for me was James Ehnes’s searching reading of the Violin Concerto, its haunting close rarely sounding so ambivalent. A searching Mompou anthology from pianist Arcadi Volodos beguiled, and orchestral thrills came courtesy of Riccardo Chailly’s sleek Brahms symphonies set with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. Chailly gives us lean, urgent performances, captured in glorious sound, with some fascinating extras on the third disc.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/classical-and-opera-2013-year-anniversaries,
463,"Fantasio, OAE, Elder, Royal Festival Hall",Fantasio,OAE,2013-12-16,Geoff Brown,"Readers who recall the 1872 Paris premiere of Offenbach’s Fantasio have had 141 years to wonder when its British debut would arrive. The long wait ended yesterday when Opera Rara, that valiant and necessary company dedicated to dusting off neglected beauties in concert versions and recordings, joined forces with its Artistic Director Sir Mark Elder and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment.  One flick of the baton and the overture began, with two limpid flutes gracefully dangling arm in arm over the unison cellos’ bass line.But the overture to what?  Based on a play by Alfred de Musset, Fantasio is not a sparkling satirical romp like La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein and much of Offenbach’s best work from the 1860s. Nor does it attempt the darker matter of his last creation, Les contes d’Hoffmann. Instead it sits awkwardly inbetween, spinning a dangerously anorexic story about a melancholy Munich student led by his heart to break up an arranged royal marriage. Comedy and the donning of disguises are included, but there is much more romantic mooning, signalled by Fantasio’s very first number, a lovely and wistful ballad to the moon itself.  Gripping stuff? Not on a dramatic level. But it’s still a charming creation. Right from the start, Elder and the OAE’s period instruments lovingly revealed the delicacy of Offenbach’s orchestrations and musical thought. Number after number offered sounds tender and wistful: a solo horn here, divided cellos there – always the colours of a composer choosing his palette with care. Just occasionally the score twiddeles its thumbs, but the arias and ensemble numbers still build into a pretty treasurable jewel box. The relative failure of Fantasio in 1872 – it lasted only 10 performances – wasn’t, I’m sure, because of its music. Aside from its somewhat watery libretto, I’d blame Paris’s factional rivalries and lingering resentments from the recent Franco-Prussian war. This was an opera set in Munich, from a composer born in Cologne. What did they expect, a standing ovation? Performing in plausible French, scores to hand, after a week of recording for Opera Rara, Elder’s cast mostly threw themselves into their roles with plenty of vim and gesturing hands. The surprising exception was Sarah Connolly in the trouser part of Fantasio himself. She looked great in trousers – she always does. I loved her velvet jacket, too. But we needed singing of greater spirit to give Fantasio some steel and spine and shake a portion of the romantic gloom from a character so entranced by the Princess of Bavaria that he disguises himself as a hump-backed jester to woo her behind closed doors. Whatever sparkle Connolly missed, the American soprano Brenda Rae (pictured in rehearsal) more than made amends with her performance as Princess Elsbeth, Bavaria’s reluctant bride. At first the voice was fragile. Then in Act Two, out came the gleaming coloratura trills and runs in the opera’s first show-stopping aria as the Princess’s feelings came to the boil. Marriage to the Prince of Mantua? Heaven forbid!Russell Braun in that role made the best of his self-pitying ballad, ""Je ne serai jamais aimé pour moi-même"". Elsewhere he capered nimbly enough in comedy exchanges with Robert Murray – very energetic and personable as the manservant Marinoni, with whom, for ancient farcical reasons, the Prince has swapped identities. It’s a pity that the comic drama’s pivot (Fantasio in his fool’s disguise hoisting up Marinoni’s wig) failed to come off on the Festival Hall stage. For that we needed proper costumes; maybe a set as well. But street clothes usually didn’t stop the fun. Neal Davies was always lively as the most voluble student, Sparck; Brindley Sherratt waved a nice regal hand as the Bavarian king; and the Opera Rara chorus never slumbered. Even Elder himself pitched in with dialogue, impersonating a tailor with enough aplomb to suggest that a new career could be possible at the Comédie-Française. But I’d rather he stayed here and conducted.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/fantasio-royal-festival-hall-0,4
464,"Parsifal, Royal Opera",Parsifal,Royal Opera,2013-12-01,David Nice,"Is anyone else sick of creepy brotherhoods skewering the transcendent in Mozart’s and Wagner’s late operas? Both Sarastro’s cult and the company of the grail are in sore need of change - ""fresh blood"" would be an unfortunate term under the circumstances - when we first encounter them. But both Simon McBurney’s production of The Magic Flute at English National Opera and now Stephen Langridge’s unleavened Royal Opera Parsifal suggest that these are sects not worth joining or saving. If I were Wagner’s hero in this unholy hall, I’d get the hell out of there and call the police.Langridge, who along with the present design team has done fine work on the powerful myth of Harrison Birtwistle's The Minotaur, is no doubt right to insist so much on grail celebrant Amfortas’s sickbed and drip. Central, certainly, is the horror of the undead ruler, pierced and wounded by a near-fatal dalliance with the most “dangerous” of the women who live on the margins of the secret society. So it's fair enough to present the hospital room, strip-lit in another cliché of alienation shared with the ENO Flute, as an ever-present centre-stage cube which “transforms” into the heart of the ceremony supposed to bring both daily relief and never-ending torment to the man who can’t die. Only here, in the first of many false steps, it’s the act itself – blood-letting of a pubescent boy (and to hell with the spoiler) – which disgusts both Gerald Finley’s tormented Amfortas, compelled to serve the needs of wheelchair-bound bloodsucker dad Titurel (Robert Lloyd), and Simon O’Neill’s appalled novice onlooker of a Parsifal. And us, too, if we’re human: this Parsifal wasn’t the only one who wanted to run away.Your attitude to all this will depend on whether or not you feel, as I do, that the director’s first duty is to honour the moments of grace amidst all the apocalyptic darkness – and it isn’t just a question of having a grail cup and a shining light. Langridge's repellent ritual cancels out all the good intentions in conductor Antonio Pappano’s finest half-hour-plus, his gentle pacing of Wagner’s transformation music and grail ceremony. With Pappano, though, if the sounds are always right and tell us how modern and pre-Debussyan the textures of this extraordinary endgame always are, the pacing isn’t.It felt especially unhelpful to the long narrative of past history unfolded by René Pape’s patient Gurnemanz after the Prelude. Pape (pictured above right with O'Neill's Parsifal in Act Three) has the most beautiful of bass timbres, he inflects the meaning well, but how – for the first time in my experience – all this essential information sagged perilously in the mouth of a narrator made by Langridge an unsympathetic cult-promoter. Pape is tested, too, by the generous outbursts of the last act, where Langridge comes closer to Wagner’s intended narrative with a Good Friday cleansing of the injured, newly experienced Parsifal by the “good father” and the now Magdalenesque Kundry.Who remains, in Angela Denoke’s dedicated interpretation, the most fascinating character in the opera: shaven-headed, dishevelled grail servant (pictured below with O'Neill in Act One), vamp under spell-bound compulsion and a woman finally restored to her noble wits. The voice isn’t exactly beautiful, there’s essentially only one colour, and it barely holds out for the final rants against a Parsifal newly aware of the weight of sin – but then the overtouted Waltraud Meier, for stage reasons alone the Kundry of choice over the past 30 years, couldn’t cut the mustard vocally there either.It doesn’t help that Pappano is again much too slow, however beautiful and sleepy the string sound, in Kundry’s weird incestuous seduction where she takes on the role of Parsifal’s mother. The red wig is the giveaway, along with the many tableaux of What Happened Earlier played out in the cube (in Act One, where they include acolyte-gone-bad Klingsor’s self-castration, they’re no substitute for the reactions of a Kundry who should be on stage all through Gurnemanz's narrative but for some reason isn’t here).With Gerald Finley’s Amfortas severely overparted and taxed to the extreme by Pappano letting his two narratives drag when at that point in each of the outer acts we want to get to the end, and Willard White’s Klingsor going through now familiar motions, it’s left to Simon O’Neill to provide the best-connected singing of the evening. He’s no great shakes as an actor, at least under Langridge; here he stumbles and totters less convincingly than everyone else, and his get-up, especially the vest in which he slays the warriors of Klingsor’s castle, isn’t flattering. But how he can pull out the stops as he realizes the significance of Amfortas’s wound after Kundry’s kiss – the production has its moment here as a second cube is unveiled with the suffering grail king revealed behind the first – and how nobly he returns the stolen spear to the brotherhood at the end. It’s just a shame that the ultimate ""redemption to the redeemer"" is nothing more than a Wizard of Oz moment, a dissolution which should have happened much earlier.O'Neill also manages to be playful with the Flowermaidens of Klingsor’s enchanted garden (pictured right with O'Neill), who eventually shuck off their widows’ headscarves and do what we usually expect of them; there are some promising voices here in the mix, chiefly Anna Devin, Celine Byrne and Anna Patalong. The female chorus, too, has a chance to make more of an impression than its male counterparts, marginalised by the ritual. Alison Chitty’s designs and Paul Pyant’s lighting come into their own for the magic; either side of it, they're far too stuck with red, grey and black. So much for a forest which ought to be a sanctuary of green but consists only of leafless timber, much of it fallen in Act Three.So Act Two, as usual with directors who don’t know what to make of the essential holiness, works best. Nor is its short Prelude scuppered like its counterparts in the outer acts - the first with a video image of Kundry's mouth - laughing at Christ, presumably - which has nothing to do with the music that's unfolding, the last with the deracination of the grail community when the strings speak of Parsifal's endless wanderings. The uncomfortable truth remains that with a grail gathering that’s the exact opposite of what Wagner intended – and it’s one of the few elements in the mystifying drama where we can be sure, however vaguely, that he intended celestial good - this evening, for all its fleeting musical pleasures, falls at the first hurdle.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/parsifal-royal-opera,2
465,Britten 100: An Aldeburgh Centenary Diary,Britten 100: An Aldeburgh Centenary Diary,,2013-11-26,Humphrey Burton,"The most intensive period of music-making I’ll ever experience, celebrating the 100th birthday of Benjamin Britten in and around his home town, ended on Sunday. I’m an Aldeburgh resident and I attended everything on offer. I thought the best way to provide an overview was to compile a diary of the past four days with a line or two about each event. Thursday  21 November (eve of the birthday) 3pm A stiff North-East wind is blowing down Crag Path and the rain is near horizontal: the Storm Interlude from Peter Grimes comes to mind. A brisk walk up the hill to pay respects in the churchyard to the gravestones of our blessed festival trinity: Britten, Pears and Imogen Holst. Inside, the inspired John Piper stained glass window celebrating Britten’s trinity of church parables (pictured right), overlooked by the forbidding bust of George Crabbe, poet of The Borough on which Peter Grimes is based. 5.30pm Off to Lowestoft, Britten’s birthplace, for the premiere in the lovely 14th century parish church of a new production of Noye’s Fludde. Best I’ve ever seen. Martin Duncan’s brilliant 1950s version has God (Zeb Soanes from Radio 4) as a mild-mannered civil servant; Noah’s ark is a stylised beach hut. Designer Francis O’Connor has a field day with the animals, who include ingenious and witty elephants, giraffes and crocodiles (pictured below). The local children, dozens of ’em, are entrancing, ditto the buglers and the handbell ringers. Andrew Shore is humane and touching as Noah, Felicity Palmer appropriately cantankerous as his wife. We all sing our hearts out in “Eternal Father” under the vigilant baton of Paul Kildea. What a start to the weekend! Three more performances were equally successful, I’m told: what a shame this lovely show hasn’t been filmed. Friday November 2210am Visit to the Red House. Because it’s BB’s actual birthday, St Cecilia’s Day, we are allowed in free and every room, upstairs and downstairs, is open to the public. What a splendid collection of paintings and china! The composing studio, restored to how it looked in the 60s when I filmed Britten at work, is especially moving and the new archive building is a triumph of beautiful functional design.  12.30pm To Snape, ten minutes drive inland: the Britten Studio in the wondrous Hoffman Building hosts the first concert of the birth-day, featuring the Benyounes Quartet, a highly-rated young English group. They play three Purcell Fantasias and Britten’s astonishing Second Quartet; in between comes young Philip Higham, performing from memory the Second Suite for solo cello, written for Rostropovich and mind-bogglingly difficult in places. The tone is set for the weekend: performances of the highest order technically and creatively. 4.30pm A birthday party in Jubilee Hall. Private enterprise event organized by Jenni Wake Walker. On the platform forty children from four very local schools, among them our very own Aldeburgh Primary. Sandwiches and tea for the entire 250 strong audience. The kids sing the first five numbers from Friday Afternoons, sparkling stuff conducted by Phelan Burgoyne Then they ask questions of the Britten veterans Jenni has assembled, among them nephews John, Alan and Sebastian and Peter Pears’s niece Sue Phipps: what were Britten’s hobbies? did he have allergies? did he like being photographed? More songs, flapjacks and cookies, followed by more questions and a Happy Birthday iced cake (pictured over the page) - a truly charming local event!7.30pm Snape Maltings Concert Hall.  The climax of the birthday (pictured below) – the BBC Symphony Orchestra in all its glory, behind it the BBC Symphony Chorus and dozens of gifted young singers from Norwich, filling this lovely hall with the epic sounds of the Spring Symphony and, earlier, the unfamiliar but beguiling Cantata Academica. Most powerful music of the evening: the Four Sea Interludes from Peter Grimes with the Passacaglia judiciously placed in the middle. Oliver Knussen in charge, conducting with steely beat and superb intensity. We Aldeburghers lapped up Grimes on the Beach only five months ago; this Britten experience was on a par.Saturday 23 November 2311am SMCH Family Concert. Back at the Maltings 13 hours later for the Young Person’s Guide to the Orchestra conducted by Mark Elder protégé Andrew Gourlay; Johny Pitts recited Simon Butteriss’s clever narrative verses to great effect. This is labelled a family affair but I suspect there are more parents than kids in the house. However we all have a good time: Soirées Musicales, based on Rossini, is a romp and early evidence of Britten’s tremendous skill as an orchestrator. BB would have approved the inclusion of three short choral pieces by young composers, sung by children from Bury St Edmund’s, Ipswich and Woodbridge. 16 year olds Jay Richardson and Luke Fitzgerald are full of promise and we already know composer Anna Meredith as a gifted all-rounder. Her cunning catch The Car is conducted by former ENO diva Claire Weston.2.30pm Orford Church (pictured below). This tribute concert includes Britten’s church music sung in his favourite church, mounted by the Aldeburgh Music Club Choir. BB and Pears helped to found the club in 1952, since when it’s evolved into a choral society (I’m currently its president). Britten scholar Philip Reed, once the club’s music director, is on hand to set in context incongruously four-square pre-war BB compositions such as Advance Democracy and the Pacifist March.Conductor Edmond Fivet brings his sonorous Prometheus Brass Ensemble into play with Purcell Funeral Odes and BB’s rarely heard Russian Funeral Music and a real bonus comes with the two choral works commissioned by the AMC to celebrate its own 60th birthday last year. Joseph Phibbs speaks feelingly about his debt to Britten before we hear his Choral Songs of Homage and Joanna Lee is on hand to supervise her colourful cantata Merman about a 14th century sea-monster which was tortured in Orford Castle before escaping to haunt the fisherfolk over the centuries - an echo of up-the-coast Peter Grimes, confidently dispatched by AMC and Framlingham’s Thomas Mills High School Senior Choir under dynamic Laura Scott. Virtuoso percussionist George Barton is breathtakingly active; BB would have admired Joanna’s inventive use of upturned frying pans as musical instruments.6pm Aldeburgh Church St Nicholas. Just time for a hasty pit-stop before another choral concert, this time back at base with a small professional orchestra (all Suffolk residents) led by Clio Gould. Ben Parry is conducting and his amateur choir, Aldeburgh Voices, sings the entire work from memory - most impressive and a great aid to communication. Alan Oke sings the saint with the same expressive insight he brought to bear on Grimes and Aschenbach earlier in the year – he is a national treasure. A word, too, in praise of the fluent duet pianists Gretel Dowdeswell (who also coached the children for Noye’s Fludde) and Bill Lloyd (who doubles as director of artist development at the Britten Pears School). What a joyful piece this is! The young Nicholas and the pickled boys are meltingly sweet and the children of Jubilee Opera Chorus perform lustily.Next page: more Britten quartets, northwards to Southwold and strings play farewell8pm and it’s back to Snape Maltings. Chamber music now in the big hall, and a full house for the Schubert G major Quartet and Britten’s Third, both written in the shadow of death - in fact Schubert never heard what he had written. I observe Colin Matthews in the audience; he worked with the dying Britten on preparation of the quartet score which was played for him at the Red House; what memories he must have! Now he’s Director of Music at the Britten Pears Foundation, one of the prime movers in these spendid celebrations. The Kuss Quartet play with a great deal of subtlety though I’m not sure I would have done the long repeat in the first movement of the Schubert;  I find myself thinking of Schumann’s implied criticism,  “heavenly length”, more than once. After the interval, the Third Quartet is a moving experience. Home to supper at the end of a long and powerful day.Sunday 24 November 9am To the studio café the BBC has installed at the top of the Maltings, looking out over the marshes, for a conversation about Britten with Suzy Klein. I stay long enough to hear tenor Ben Johnson sing three of BB’s folk song arrangements with the guitar stunningly played by Sean Shibe. The BBC has really put out the boat for this Britten 100 Weekend; on air it’s been wall-to-wall Britten enriched by mini-documentaries and archive features, all seasoned by the wit of Sean Rafferty and the wisdom of fellow presenters  Andrew McGregor, Tom Service and the Britten experts John Bridcut and Paul Kildea. The entire operation reminds me of the dedicated weekends John Drummond instigated decades ago – I remember fondly participating in Radio 3’s Week on the Danube and the Tanglewood Weekend. But they were back in the 1990s when there was more money around: it’s good to see controller Roger Wright going for broke and most effectively joining forces with the local planners, Aldeburgh Music. 11am Snape Maltings. The last in the series of Britten quartet concerts and another large audience for a splendid programme given by Ensemble 360 (pictured left). Theirs is the most sonorous of the three groups we’ve heard and perfect for both BB’s early First Quartet, written in 1941, and Shostakovich’s atmospheric Piano Quintet, composed the year before - a nice pairing, preceded by the novelty of the three Divertimenti Britten composed for quartet while still at the Royal College. His fertility - the abundance and quality of his musical ideas - becomes apparent as never before thanks to this weekend overview of his output in so many fields.  3.30pm Southwold Church. Northwards for the last time, in lovely weather, to another fine medieval church, where the BBC Singers are installed for choral music by Britten and his teachers Frank Bridge and John Ireland. Peter Pears sang in this group before the war; they begin today with the Hymn to St Cecilia which their forerunners premiered in 1942, a lovely detailed interpretation under the guidance of David Hill. During the course of the afternoon which climaxes with a spirited reading of Rejoice in the Lamb we have heard half a dozen of the individual voices of this excellent ensemble. They display total commitment to Britten’s music whether it be playful (as in his treatment of Christopher Smart’s weird and wonderful verses) or touchingly eloquent, when responding to the best passages in the poems of his mentor and friend W H Auden (“Out on the lawn I lie in bed” was a highlight of the Spring Symphony on Friday.)  7.30pm Snape Maltings (Britten and Pears pictured below in front of the hall in 1969 by Hans Wild). Aldeburgh Strings play the closing concert. Stunning is the only word for it. 30 hand-picked players, each one a virtuoso and coached for a week by leading professionals. The warmth and strength of their sound is overwhelming and they look good, too, standing in a broad semi-circle with only the cellos seated.  Directed by Markus Däunert in the leader’s position, they begin with a full-blooded account of Purcell’s great Chacony and follow up with the Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge.These players can cope with anything Britten throws at them by way of technical challenge – the Moto Perpetuo variation is dazzling, the Viennese Waltz and the Romance utterly charming, the Italian Aria breathtaking. They also know how to plumb the depths of feeling that emerge in the Funeral March and the fugal Finale.An exhilarating first half is followed by the 1943 Serenade. The strings are seated now: solo tenor Allan Clayton, finely nuanced throughout, and horn player Richard Watkins, flawless, stand in their midst until the last song: Watkins then goes off stage and his distant playing of the Epilogue is like the ghost of Britten himself, departing from his beloved Maltings. The music segues seamlessly into Arvo Pärt’s Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten and the concert closes on a surge of emotion for which I can find no parallel in my own experience.  So thank you Aldeburgh Music for planning this weekend and providing a programme book worthy of the occasion. Thank you, BBC Radio 3 for backing it so comprehensively, and above all thank you to the Suffolk and Norfolk children (and their devoted teachers) for making so many of the events so very special.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/britten-100-aldeburgh-centenary-diary,
466,"Albert Herring, BBCSO, Bedford, Barbican",Albert Herring,BBCSO,2013-11-24,David Nice,"Three cheers for good old Albert, natural laugh-out-loud heir of Verdi’s Falstaff and Puccini’s Gianni Schicchi, and the best possible way to mark creator Britten’s being one hundred years and one day old. Youth has its day in both those earlier masterpieces, but the lovers are subordinate to the middle-aged comic protagonists. Here they're the equals of a hero who is no scamster but a shy grocer’s boy who busts out drinking and worse to loosen the apron strings of a prim community. He may have had his funniest incarnation yet last night in young Andrew Staples' characterisation, very much at the centre -  alongside Steuart Bedford’s 13-piece BBC Symphony Orchestra team - of a peerless cast.The special wonder of Kenneth Richardson’s Barbican semi-staging was how timeless this comedy remains. I eat my words about Eric Crozier’s libretto, a luminous transformation of Maupassant's rather sad little story, being next best to Auden’s for Paul Bunyan among Britten’s operas: it’s joint first. Auden might have attempted to play too much with the vernacular; Crozier (pictured with Britten at Glyndebourne in 1946 by Maria Austria, part of the National Portrait Gallery's current photo exhibition) hits it spot on, and manages to rhyme, mostly effortlessly, into the bargain. And he created a more memorable ensemble of characters, on which last night’s first-rate team seemed happy to capitalize. I don’t know whether it’s been done before, but Roderick Williams and Gillian Keith were determined to make the most of a budding old-fashioned romance between sententious vicar and gushing schoolma’am (after all, they do start duetting the Song of Solomon).Crude caricatures were avoided in the village committee determined to plonk the May-Queen’s orange blossom crown on Albert in the absence of suitable local maidens – which doesn’t mean we failed to laugh at the Superintendant Budd of Matthew Rose, a tad free of pitch and note-value but developing as a bass of colossal force, or the automatic rifle-fire May Day speech of Adrian Thompson’s Mayor. Christine Brewer, the greatest Isolde of our times, was luxuriously cast as moralizing Lady Billows: after all, there are plenty of top B flats and even the occasional C in amongst all the dudgeon. Her keynote May Day speech brought comedy to hysteria pitch with its collapse into nationalistic clichés, and the coda – “stand to receive this purse of otterskin – me father shot the brute in ’56 on Christmas Eve – with five and twenty sovereigns inside” – was just as funny. Backing her up with rich vocals was Gaynor Keeble as between-two-worlds housekeeper Florence Pike, excelling in her Act Two harangue.Above all there was great beauty of line when Britten allows it, and Richardson let his cast be sincere in the moment, supremely so in Williams’ melting delivery of Mr Gedge’s “virtue” solo and the lament of Albert’s mum, the ever superb Catherine Wyn-Rogers playing it straight: no sending-up here when there’s a real possibility, to Mrs Herring at least, of her son being lost for ever. But the real plums belong to Britten’s anthems for happy youth. If the three kids seemed a bit muted from halfway back on the Barbican stage – a tricky acoustic, especially with the instrumental ensemble dead-centre, and stage left was not helpful for anybody from where I was sitting – they came into their own in the ceremonials, while Albert and the young lovers could not have been better cast.Marcus Farnsworth as Sid, the butcher’s boy who abets Albert’s rite of passage by spiking his May Day lemonade with rum, and Kitty Whately as his girl Nancy from the bakery were so easy together, so perfect of phrase in their two delicious and slightly off-kilter love duets: a better paragon of the new-generation singers you’d not find anywhere. And Staples (pictured with them above) was there claiming character for Albert from the start: not for him anything “disconcertingly blurry” about the lad in the opera's first half, as the Britten-ubiquitous Paul Kildea claims in another of his programme notes to ignore any musical virtues (were it not for the word ""librettist"", you'd think from it that Albert Herring is a straight play, though to be fair there were a few references to the music in the synopsis). This is a boy ready to burst; intoxication is merely the touch paper, as with the potion in Wagner’s Tristan und Isolde, thrice quoted by Britten in connection with the catalytic drink.Already in Act One Scene Two's lyric peak, “It seems as clear as clear can be”, Staples was generously connecting the lines and giving us all the yearning Britten’s straightforward steps can take. But it was in the great post-party monologue, surely modelled in essence if not in situation on Beckmesser’s soliloquy in Die Meistersinger, that comic genius came to the fore. It helps that Staples looks like a cross between Eddie Izzard and Graham Norton. Already known as a director of some talent, the tenor must surely have worked out the gags himself: the box of Swan Vestas to light the gas sitting by the conductor’s side, the drunken leaning on consummate flautist Michael Cox, leek rampant in hand when Albert goes off on his binge that’s wilted on his return (Staples pictured above with Brewer, Keeble and Thompson) and used to pat the bottom of outraged Lady B when he asks her to let him get on in the shop, “for I’m all behind”.Crucially, there were pathos and phantasmagoria in the night-music too, the point at which the already wonderful BBCSO soloists began to fuse supernaturally with the singers. Hard to tell who was the better whistler:  Staples, Farnsworth or violinists Stephen Bryant and Anna Smith. Invidious as it may be to select from the chamber group, since Britten writes as well for each of the players as he does for the singers, I have to note unforgettable moments from oboist Richard Simpson lamenting with Mrs H, harpist Sioned Williams’ loveladen flourishes and Richard Hosford’s haunting bass clarinet. It seemed incredible, too, that Bedford should be as nuanced at the piano as he was in keeping the ensemble tight and clear: was that doubling-up a first?All this was a vivid reminder that in making the most of economics – Albert, like The Rape of Lucretia before it, was designed for touring, a fact this resourceful semi-staging pointed up – Britten managed to be so miraculous with his team of 26 singers and instrumentalists. And it’s been one of the joys of centenary year to follow in chronological order the path from Paul Bunyan through the Festival Hall concert Peter Grimes and the dip (for me at any rate) of Lucretia at Glyndebourne to the comic soaring of this Albert Herring – a work, or so it seemed last night, with no kind of fault or flaw.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/albert-herring-bbcso-bedford-barbican,5
467,"Sonica, Glasgow",Sonica,Glasgow,2013-11-23,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"At first it looked like a joke. But, as each muscle spasm, set off by an electric shock, did appear to produce a pained expression in the performer and a subsequent note, one slowly had to accept that these four string quartet players were indeed being electrocuted into performance. The Wigmore Hall, it wasn’t. Sonica, it certainly was.This was the second year of the four-day festival that, each November, takes over Glasgow's galleries, theatres, warehouses and shop windows and runs amok, stretching the meaning of music to its artistic, intellectual and technological limits. Cross-pollination is everything. This year we had a musical lunch, a sonically composed walk and an aural experience that was mainly being transmitted through our feet. Some of the experiments fell flat, several triumphed.The festival opened with a set from Norwegian vocalist Maja S K Ratkje, who delivered a blistering VJ-accompanied improvisation at last year’s Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival (HCMF). There was an attractive synergy between HC Gilje’s LED video that flowed across 18 screens and Ratkje’s sophisticated electronically-underpinned improvisation, order emerging out of chaos (see picture below). A splash of the crotales, or a sliver of a whistle, would become a pulse; a screen of lines might become a cross-hatch. The epiphanic heights of HCMF weren't quite achieved this time. This was a more subtle show, a music box rising up from the sonic detritus that Ratkje had gathered together.It wasn’t the only transfer from HCMF to appear at Sonica. They share an artistic director in Graham Mackenzie. Cathie Boyd and Patrick Dickie complete the top team. Yannis Kyriakides’s The Buffer Zone, which premiered in Huddersfield in 2005, is an opera woven from the sonic scraps of daily life accrued by a bored Cypriot border guard. Whistling, humming, the mantra of the walk-talkie (""over-and-out""): Kyriakides knitted these fragments of tedium to some composed music for piano and cello, who played either side of a screen, watched over by the sentry, Tido Visser. The work, unfortunately, never transcended its source material and we never transcended the tedium.Risk-taking of a special kind greeted us at the CCA gallery. At one end of a room we could see and hear the hum of three mosquitoes, who'd been stuck to the spot with hot wax and on whom were being encouraged to breath. Carbon dioxide, apparently, excites mosquitoes. Their consequent movements were being filmed and projected onto the walls. At the other end of the room, artists Robin Meier and Ali Momeni were tending to the substitute mosquitoes, feeding them sugar water, keeping them alive, for their turn to come.Believing the computer-generated Indian drone piped out over speakers to be a possible mate, the three male mosquitoes were buzzing back in sympathy and attempted synchronisation. What filled the room, then, was an extraordinary love song and, more abstractly, a sensational piece of Niblock-ian drone art.Not all hybridisation ended up in such sophisticated territory. The other show at the CCA Raydale Dower’s The Eye of the Duck, built on promising foundations, recreating the memorable Red Room from David Lynch’s Twin Peaks, under-delivered. As, sadly, did Michael Davies’s Compositions for Involuntary Strings, the night the string quartet was tortured at the Tramway.The underlying principles were interesting. Davies had composed her works so that they would produce a series of electric shocks, which would force certain muscles of each wired-up musician to expand or contract and induce them to make an involuntary sound from their instrument. Even a composition based on electrocuting your players, however, requires interesting musical ideas. And Davies didn’t provide us with enough in this respect. The best parts were the least serious, especially in the third movement of FM2030, when the spasming resulted in crazed, non-musical salutes and sweeps of the arm.The off-piste explorations are as important as the theatre-bound ones at Sonica. Braving the rain and cold always brought rewards. Exploring Sven Werner’s world was as ever intriguing. We were invited this year to his studio above a fishmongers where each hour a performance would be struck up on one of his dilapidated instruments.I caught one: an extraordinary duet, in which the bare strings of two naked pianos were being sounded using loose bow hairs and hammers, a Charlemagne Palestine-like cloud of chordal sound emanating into the room. There is a certain tweeness to Werner’s Victoriana-obsessed aesthetic (which will see him hiding a projector in a battered old suitcase) but you can’t gainsay his imagination.A certain Alice in Wonderland tweeness carried over into the Lunchbox “adventure” from Josh Armstrong, with its packages of food and drink and  instructions labelled “eat me”, “drink me”, “pick me”, “read me” etc. The words were encouragingly poetic, as was the weather, but the idea that I was going to create a theatrical performance out of my food rather than just eat it (and wonder if it was any good - which it wasn't) was always going to be a bit optimistic.Of the ambulatory commissions, the best was Rob van Rijswijk and Jeroen Strijbos’s Walk With Me piece that, using an iphone map to morph the music as we walked, scored the entire city in various luminous and cloudy washes of electronic and acousmatic sound. Highlights included the jungle of noise that appeared as we crossed one of Glasgow’s major arteries and the Susan Stenger-like consonant revelation at the Kelvingrove Park fountain.The Picture Window series, co-curated by Annie Crabtree and Eileen Daily, one of the outstanding moments of last year’s Sonica, proved fascinating again. Not all of it was ready for the start of the festival but the best installation was. All Eyes Wide saw artists Edward Crawley and video artist Jamie Wardrop take over a shop in the centre of Glasgow and transform it into a vast, imaginary sonic playground. Blindfolded and headphoned, we wandered around the space barefoot, the floor and music changing in texture and warmth. A man took our hand, offered us objects and delivered a world-weary narrative of 20-something life. Beautifully executed and powerfully imagined, this was one of the stand-out works of the festival.Sonica is a generous place. Risks are taken but fun is had, too. Which other new-music festival would ferry us out-of-town to a warehouse and offer us, alongside some intensely memorable and seriously playful free improv from Giles Perring, a light show centred around an Elvis tribute act and a flying, blow-up fish?Don't be fooled. Sonica is no circus. This is the future of contemporary music. Those who have even the slightest interest in what happens next should make sure they catch it.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/sonica-glasgow,4
468,"The Magic Flute, English National Opera",The Magic Flute,English National Opera,2013-11-08,David Nice,"There’s a scene in Mozart’s most metaphysical opera which Ingmar Bergman, creator of what is still the richest of all Magic Flutes, describes as “at the outermost limit of life”. Hero Tamino seems to have reached a point of no return and no going forward. “When will this darkness end?”, he asks, and voices reply, “Soon, soon or never”.We must believe the extremity in that rite of passage. But not only are the vital choral responses unmysterious and perfunctory in this new ENO production; Complicite director Simon McBurney has it that the page of a giant video-projected picture book has already turned a new leaf. Ah, a bestiary – so we’re already on to the next stage in the story, Tamino's Orpheus-serenade to the beasts, or rather his female counterpart's from the ENO orchestra, when we need to be in the moment. It’s information overload as usual.This is both the most restless and the most lightless of interpretations. If Mozart’s rainbow-hued score is Oz in excelsis, full of warmth and wit as well as profundity, here we’re stuck in a mostly black-and-white, poker-faced, post-nuclear Kansas of strip-lit underground bunkers peopled by sinister men in suits and a cult-leader Sarastro in reflector specs. The singers over-project and force tone with an attitude the very opposite of the composer’s easy-seeming naturalness. What promises so much at the start, with a raised pit where instrumentalists are set to become equal participants with the singers as they fizz in newcomer Gergely Madaras’s account of the Overture, quickly becomes overdrive both orchestral and vocal with grim, charmless ladies and a speed through the sublime music of the Three Spirits who take over their guidance on a magic journey.McBurney’s mesmerising production of the Bulgakov-adapted novelty A Dog’s Heart at ENO proved that video design in opera was not the outworn cliché it seemed by then to have already become; this time, for all the valiant efforts of the stalwart Finn Ross, it constantly has you asking whether so much might be more magically done with the more conventional means at music-theatre’s disposal. There are moments of customary Complicite invention: the trials in which Pamina leads Tamino through fire and water (Ben Johnson and Devon Guthrie pictured above in the first of two ENO production shots by Robbie Jack) respectively blaze and bubble with hallucinatory intensity, and the sun puts in a luminous appearance – I won’t spoil the effect by explaining how it’s represented– at the end.Unfortunately it’s too little light too late, as is the belated humour of Roland Wood’s overspread-baritone Papageno in a genuinely funny scene with wine bottles and a reluctant glockenspielist/glockenspielerin (she deserves a programme credit as much as flautist Katie Bedford). Such moments are not, alas, as redemptive or show-saving as Calixto Bieito’s crucial string-quartet coup in his much maligned Fidelio, and would that the video images in conjunction with Michael Levine's bare set design anywhere equalled the haunting photographs of Robert and Shana ParkeHarrison reproduced in the programme.No one is vocally in top form, though given the distractions it’s not surprising. Ben Johnson delivers his aria of enchantment at Pamina’s portrait with a forcefulness verging on the heldentenor-esque; his true love come to life, Devon Guthrie, is equally gutsy and determined, reminding us that it's a strong, good woman who redeems the secret brotherhood. Yet she only really hits the heights when facing Sarastro or grieving at Tamino’s apparent turning away. Tuning is a problem for Cornelia Götz’s crippled, Miss Havishamy Queen of the Night – though she pips out all the notes in her coloratura bar a weaker top F with luminous accuracy – and for Steven Page’s Speaker, who needs to be in much closer communication with Johnson's acolyte.Brian Galliford’s wicked henchman Monostatos is all over the place vocally, and repellent beyond the call of duty. Ladies and boys – done up as skeletal old men - do a fine vocal job and James Creswell, so good earlier this season as Rocco in Fidelio, makes an imposing impression at first, but not ultimately one of benevolence or goodness; how can he when the production insists he’s creepy, manipulative and cold?In fact those are the only terms to describe this production. Its additional annoyances are the rocking platform, creating mal de mer (in Pamina's case mal de mère) when we need stillness, and the insistent apocalyptic sound design by Gareth Fry. It thunders and rumbles through the pared-down dialogue, and there’s a thrumming even in some of the musical numbers which creates an air of restlessness as irritating as a Carnegie Hall audience (in my experience, I should add, since a commenter forces me to qualify) .The 14 actors are noisy and distracting, too, above all in their paper-fluttering birds (pictured above with Mary Bevan as Papagena and Roland Wood as Papageno), and the final nail in the coffin is the dismal translation by Stephen Jeffreys. I thought the stressing of one chant at the Barbican demonstration which I attended beforehand was odd enough – “SOME Russians ARE gay – GET over IT” – but this was more seriously awry; the text just doesn't fit the vocal lines. Anyone expecting a fresh alternative to the durable, colourful Hytner predecessor at ENO may find hopes dampened; best stay at home with either the Bergman classic movie or even – and it’s surprisingly good, if not quite on the same level – Branagh's First World War fantasia.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/magic-flute-english-national-opera,2
469,"Don Giovanni, Opera Vera",Don Giovanni,Opera Vera,2013-11-03,Mark Valencia,"For a brand-new opera group to set something as ambitious as Don Giovanni before an audience demands sackfuls of self-awareness and confidence. But the eight young singers of Opera Vera are no mere enthusiasts – they are rich in experience and can all boast busy CVs – so it would be discourteous to consider them by anything other than rigorous professional criteria. Given the opera’s countless bear-traps, then, it is not to damn with faint praise to say that they produced an intelligent and thoroughly musical account of Mozart’s score.Accompanied by 11 musicians from the Brillig Ensemble (an alumni offshoot of the Southbank Sinfonia) under Philip Hesketh, the orchestral aspect was perfectly competent, albeit hamstrung by the lack of numbers. There were patches of exposed playing because the orchestra was simply too small to do justice to the score’s many colours; reduced forces may work for the early piano concertos but Don Giovanni is mature Mozart and demands a richer palette. As it was, not only was there tinkering to cover missing instruments but the mandolin accompaniment to ""Deh vienni alla finestra"" was played on an accordion and the continuo on a modern grand piano. The chorus part was entirely excised. It was that sort of evening: pleasant on the ear but not exactly historically informed.The production, such as it was, need not detain us long. Opera Vera’s pre-publicity claimed to place the work in Silvio Berlusconi’s Italy but little of that impinged on the performance beyond a few perfunctory slogans and some stickers given to the audience on arrival. Director Nina Brazier made such free use of existing church paraphernalia at St Paul’s, Covent Garden – pulpit, pews and chair – that the opera’s dramatic discords felt more like a Synod schism than a night in bunga-bungaland. No matter; with Don Giovanni’s notorious failure rate it’s better to be on the chancel steps than in the director’s graveyard.It was refreshing to hear good young voices in an opera that deals so candidly with human urges and emotions. James McOran-Campbell as the wicked Don was magnetic: a man possessed by a sexual energy that left him unable to function at normal levels of human interaction. His command of the role was assured and his vocal quality, wanting only a true sotto voce, terrifically exciting. He is only a few vocal colours away from being a considerable Don Giovanni.McOran-Campbell was well partnered by Peter Brooke as his Sancho Panza-in-sleaze, Leporello. After a hesitant start (not helped by an unfortunate lighting glitch) the youthful baritone traded swagger for stupidity but kept the gurning this side of idiotic. His warm baritone was a revelation and he delighted the audience with his catalogue aria. Alexander Anderson-Hall as Don Ottavio seemed less comfortable by comparison: he acquitted himself well in the opera’s sublime tenor arias (both of which were retained) but tended to disappear in duos and ensembles.The distaff battle was a hard-fought contest, with Susan Jiwey an impassioned Donna Elvira (albeit with a few issues of precision in recitatives), Stefanie Kemball-Read a fervent Donna Anna (despite some stridency under pressure) and Rebecca Dale the winner on points as a manipulative Zerlina who sang with great character while wearing a skimpy white dress that had a mind of its own. Her other half, Masetto, was finely characterised by the excellent Nicolas Dwyer, while the steady Will Kwiatkowski, though more a light baritone than a bass, carried both dignity and menace as the Commendatore.The Actors’ Church acoustic was not kind to the contrapuntal ensemble writing that is such a dominant element in this opera, and it must be said that few of the evening’s performances were strong on subtlety. Despite the sub-minimalist staging there were moments of careless stage management and some bad surtitling errors that affected both ""Il mio tesoro"" and ""Mi tradi"". Yet for all its rough edges this was a compelling evening whose three hours flew by at a lick, and an assured début from a company that deserves to thrive and grow.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/don-giovanni-opera-vera,3
470,"Wozzeck, Royal Opera",Wozzeck,Royal Opera,2013-11-01,Kimon Daltas,"You could hardly ask for a better cast than the one assembled for this short run of Wozzeck at the Royal Opera House: Simon Keenlyside in the title role, Karita Mattila, John Tomlinson, Mark Elder in the pit. And at a top price of £65, with many tickets going for much less, this is quite the bargain – not least because the marquee names absolutely nail the performance.Keenlyside jitters and stiffens as Wozzeck gets progressively consumed by imagined and real-life torments, while harnessing the strange lyricism of his vocal lines. Mattila, her voice full and perfectly controlled, brings a poignancy to the adulterous but long-suffering Marie. Meanwhile, Tomlinson uses his magnetic stage presence and flawless delivery to disturbing effect as the unscrupulous Doctor (pictured below). The supporting roles are also well handled by Gerhard Siegel (Captain), Endrik Wottrich (Drum Major), John Easterlin (Andres), Allison Cook (Margret) and the rest of the cast.The orchestra plus on- and off-stage bands complete the picture – it really is an as-near-as-damn-it ideal account of Berg's first opera, a work still staggeringly modern and vital 91 years down the line. Strange then that it should be the staging that feels like it hasn’t aged well since its first outing a mere 10 years ago. Director Keith Warner and set designer Stefanos Lazaridis, the latter sadly no longer with us, were the dream team behind Covent Garden’s much admired Ring, yet the approach here tends occasionally to undermine the drama.The main set is a strange lab-like space with mildew blooming in the corners, a white tiled box with a raked floor, its seams drawing the eye into a trick of perspective. It's dominated by four large glass boxes, initially covered in white sheets but gradually revealed to show one containing giant mushrooms, one specimen jars, one a model of house in the mountains, and one just water.Twice, an upside-down black triangle as wide as the stage is lowered down to reveal a window cut into it, then a few minutes later flown back out again. It all feels somehow significant but that’s really the problem – should one be puzzling over what the staging might mean when there’s a human tragedy unfolding?Not that it is short of memorable and affecting touches: thanks to the illusionist’s trick of a large angled mirror, Marie first appears pinned to the back wall like a butterfly; in a grizzly coup de theatre, Wozzeck’s death ends with him suspended in a bloody aquarium like a specimen. But there is very little of the mundane, impoverished normality which might allow us to see Wozzeck as a broken human being, rather than just a symbol amid a sea of symbols. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/wozzeck-royal-opera,4
471,"Death in Venice, Opera North",Death in Venice,Opera North,2013-10-26,graham Rickson,"From the strange, stuttering opening to its elegiac, drawn-out coda, this is an exquisite, lovingly realised staging of Britten's last opera. It's so good that it amplifies any doubts that you might have about this peculiar, distinctly unlovable piece.Perhaps we've been spoilt here in Leeds by the concurrent revivals of Peter Grimes and A Midsummer Night's Dream – both vibrant, colourful operas. Death in Venice is a tougher proposition – the score so spare, so parched that you can't help suspecting at times that Britten's inspiration was starting to flag. Thomas Mann's source novella was skilfully adapted by Britten and librettist Myfanwy Piper, but the first act in particular feels much too long for its slender musical material, Alan Oke's Aschenbach called upon to deliver rather too many streams of thin, piano-accompanied recitative. Britten could be a remarkable, characterful melodist. Here, it's as if he's expending every effort to suppress the gift.Which means that the sporadic flashes of colour in Act 1 have a huge impact. You'll squirm with delight at the chiming bells and archaic, hocketing brass which ring out when Aschenbach arrives in Venice, and there's a glorious, potent theme which accompanies his looking out at the sea from his hotel window, later developed to fascinating effect. The second act is more varied and compelling, its closing minutes an unearthly, sublime mixture of Balinese gamelan and late-period Mahler. You marvel at Britten's percussion writing, able to suggest a steamboat's engine or children's games with deft ease. The musical glancing back at the comparative innocence and exuberance of Britten's ballet The Prince of the Pagodas is disquieting, and entirely at odds with the oppressiveness, the dourness of what we hear in this opera.Yoshi Oida's 2007 staging, here revived by Rob Kearley, still looks tremendous. Tom Schenk's spare set makes imaginative use of wooden decking and real water – though if you're sat in the stalls, you might not notice. Aschenbach's gondola trips are neatly implied by little more than a dancer wielding an oar, and the crowd scenes are well done, the immaculate period costumes nicely at odds with the score's uneasy modernity.It's beautifully lit by Paule Constable. Better still is the choreography, originally by Daniela Kurz but here revived by Katharina Bader, the extended children's dance sequences visually compelling. Vocally, all is good. Alan Oke copes heroically with Britten's demands, and he's superb at conveying Aschenbach's physical decline.Surtitles are only used for the chorus work, but I found Oke's diction to be perfectly clear, and he does succeed in evoking our sympathy. A chameleon-like Peter Savidge skilfully inhabits the multiple roles – most strikingly a grotesque Elderly Fop (pictured above) and an oleaginous Barber, whose crude attempt to rejuvenate Aschenbach near the opera's close is toe-curlingly uncomfortable.Dancer Emily Mézières plays the mute Tadzio, looking suitably androgynous and otherworldly. The score is dispatched with skill and sensitivity by the ever-attentive Richard Farnes. An unsettling, oddly gripping evening. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/death-venice-opera-north,4
472,"The Killing Flower, Linbury Studio Theatre",The Killing Flower,Linbury Studio Theatre,2013-10-25,alexandra Coghlan,"In this classical anniversary year we’ve had masses of Wagner and Verdi, plenty of Britten (and still more Britten) but not much has been heard of 2013’s other birthday-boy, the notorious Carlo Gesualdo – prince, priest, composer and murderer. Best known for the extraordinary chromatic contortions of his madrigals and the stark, chiaroscuro beauty of his Tenebrae Responsories, the legend of his private life still dwarfs all. And it’s this story that provides inspiration for Salvatore Sciarrino’s 1998 chamber opera The Killing Flower.An unaccompanied female voice pierces the blackness with white sound, tracing the arching contours of an elegy by 16th-century composer Claude Le Jeune. In the dark, melodies are long and connected in an unfolding sequence of continuity and development. But as soon as the elegy finishes and light is restored, musical certainties shatter. Phrases become abortive, fluttering affairs, as though a Monterverdi trill has become trapped, moth-like, in a jar, and now repeatedly beats and tremors.Sciarrino’s sound-world is utterly unlike any other, as much characterised by what it doesn’t do as what it does. It doesn’t do development, as such, but a strange unity is conferred on the writing by repeating rhythmic patterns and phrase-shapes. Phrases are relative concepts here, constructed as much by the listeners, as we mentally fill in the sonic gaps and silences, as by the music itself. It’s like musical Pinter, a drama of the unspoken and the unspeakable.  In six short scenes the opera follows the relationship between the Duke and his Duchess from passionate love through infidelity (hers) and eventually to murder (also hers, and her lover’s). It’s a quick collapse that wastes no time on practicalities. Sciarrino’s scuttling musical motifs give us thoughts in their natural state – jerky, occasionally jarring and often half-formed – allowing him to cut straight to the emotional business. The result is instinctive and surprisingly flexible. A duet between the Duchess (Amanda Forbes, pictured below right with George Humphreys) and the Guest (William Towers) is quietly erotic, exploiting the timbral closeness of the soprano and countertenor voices and occasionally placing the male on top of the texture as the two writhe and coil musically among one another.The muscular purity of Towers’ voice works well here, swelling into enough richness to match the outstanding Forbes. Of all the singers it is she who finds the through-line in Sciarrino’s glittering fragments, stringing them together into something beautiful. George Humphreys’ Duke, though dramatically convincing, seemed less at ease in the composer’s musical idiom, never quite joining the dots into a coherent picture.Michael McCarthy’s understated, period production is very effective in a gutted Linbury Theatre that embraces singers, orchestra and audience all together in a single space. Ideally McCarthy would have dispensed with the weary theatrical go-tos of rose petals falling from the sky, billowing parachute silk, and black, white and red colour-scheme, but as with all clichés these visual tics are ubiquitous for a reason… McCarthy made them work as well as anyone ever has, and in the context of an otherwise sensitive production can be forgiven.The Killing Flower is a memorable piece, and one that gets to the emotional point in a way few contemporary operas can. I spent little more than an hour in the company of Sciarrino’s troubled characters, and yet when I left they refused to leave me. Gothic, astringent and unexpectedly moving – as tributes to Gesualdo’s 400th birthday go, it’s fitting indeed.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/killing-flower-linbury-studio-theatre,4
473,"Greek, Music Theatre Wales, Linbury Studio Theatre",Greek,Music Theatre Wales,2013-10-22,alexandra Coghlan,"“Fancy my mum? I’d rather go down on Hitler.” When the verbal violence of Steven Berkoff meets Mark-Anthony Turnage’s musical iconoclasm, the result is unlike any Oedipus story you’ve ever heard. Well, except for the shagging his mum bit. That’s still much the same. Since its premiere in 1988, Greek has become something of a contemporary classic, and has proved again and again that it really deserves its place in both the repertoire and the opera house. Reviving their award-winning 2011 production, Music Theatre Wales have returned to remind us just how good the piece is, and what a star they have in leading-man Marcus Farnsworth.Trading Thebes for the East End, Berkoff reworks the myth for the London of the 1980s – all riots, racism and social disaffection. Oedipus becomes Eddy (Farnsworth, pictured below), a son who leaves the family home to better himself, only to end up murdering a café owner in a row over cheesecake and marrying his widow (as you do).Mirroring the pacy urgency of the libretto, Turnage’s score slips from speech to song with an ease that is anything but easy to achieve. Perhaps it’s the vernacular muscularity of the composer’s melodies, which can summon drunken football chants as vividly as moments of declamatory passion; or perhaps it’s the unobtrusive continuity of the orchestral score which takes quite its own path, sometimes meeting up with the voices, sometimes diverging entirely. Thick with the bright tones of trumpet, saxophone and harp, the orchestra repeatedly bullies the voices, cuffing them and shouting them down. The voices in turn are made ugly in the battle, just as the lives of Turnage’s characters are made ugly by their struggle against Fate.All of which only makes Farnsworth’s legato lyricism more striking. Though apparently suffering from illness on opening night, he spun lines of implausible beauty out of Turnage’s soft-centred score, syncopating them with percussive speech-song and some ferocious straight acting. His Eddy has a nice line in cheeky chappie, likely lad, and his swaggering warmth is a large part of what makes this tragedy cut so deep.Director Michael McCarthy keeps it simple and playful, carrying across some of the alienation effects from Turnage’s score into a DIY staging that squeezes blood straight from the ketchup bottle. His cast are game for anything, gyrating around microphone as a multi-voiced sphinx, engaging in a vigorous (and ingenious choreographed fight-scene) and bringing these cartoon-grotesque characters to grinning life. Sarah Silver is touchingly awful as Eddy’s mum, brightest of all the figures that surround him. Louise Winter sings a mean seduction scene, and her extraordinary ballad bemoaning the death of an abusive husband is one of Turnage’s most inspired gems.The whole score is alive with cruel invention, whether in harmonic or textural vitriol that is the musical echo of Tony Harrison’s “V” (a chorus of stamping boots and riots shields is somehow more than a gimmick) or in the careful cadence of speech-sung rhythms and phrases that at once recall and distort the familiar shapes of conversation. The libretto too, bending to the inevitable forces around it, changes from cockney to altogether more lofty language as Eddy moves closer to his classical doom.Greek is at once a mythic tragedy and a neat contemporary subversion, a parable and a barnstorming tale. In Music Theatre Wales’s production it’s also a hit. Just don’t sit too close to the stage, because it’ll hurt in all the wrong ways.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/greek-music-theatre-wales-linbury-studio-theatre,4
474,"The Rape of Lucretia, Glyndebourne Tour",The Rape of Lucretia,Glyndebourne Tour,2013-10-20,David Nice,"“Aren’t you sick of Britten yet?” asked a colleague three-quarters of the way through the composer’s centenary year. Absolutely not; there have been revelations and there still remains so much to discover or re-discover. Yet re-evaluation can sour as well as sweeten; acclaimed works in the canon may turn out less good than remembered. Was it my own temporary blind spot, the problem of the piece or the musical and dramatic shortcomings so apparent in Fiona Shaw’s Glyndebourne Tour production of The Rape of Lucretia that I emerged into the crepuscular garden unmoved and a little repelled?Heretical thoughts crept in very early on and persisted. That Britten’s two-act operatic retelling of the clash between noble Roman constancy and Etruscan violence through a contemporary, Christian filter in 1946 might have been distilled as one continuous, 80-minute work - that those set-pieces, starting with the seemingly undistinguished duets and solos for the soldiers camped outside Rome, might be snipped with no loss to musical-theatre tension. That Ronald Duncan’s libretto was much, much worse in its gaucheries and pretensions than I’d remembered (how many excruciating examples do you want?). That the cor anglais passage tracing the raped Lucretia’s shame before patient husband Collatinus seemed so phoney, the ending - musically justified at least - so glib.But several decades ago when I saw the opera three, four times, I’d overlooked what seemed like minor defects and succumbed to the power of the whole. Why was that power missing from a show that should have had so much to offer? Neither singing, direction nor playing were nearly sharp enough.Visually, there was promise that rarely delivered. Michael Levine’s set is a steepishly raked rectangle covered in dirt where we discover the Male Chorus (Allan Clayton) feverishly digging at the start (why only becomes clear much later). A tent is deftly raised for the military dominated by febrile Tarquinius Sextus (Duncan Rock). Rooms and crosses are described for the linen-refreshed house of Lucretia in the city. A cyclorama effectively lit by Paul Anderson evokes different times of night, day and the no-man’s-land glare of the rape (Clayton, Rock, Claudia Huckle and Kate Valentine pictured above).Time hangs heavy in each of the one-hour acts. When Oliver Dunn’s unfocused Junius or Claudia Huckle’s sensitively acted but often inaudible Lucretia – good low register, invisible top - are singing or Clayton moves upstage (the upper and lower registers of this usually clarion tenor sounded occluded last night). When Tarquinius’s pulsing ride to Rome and the dumbshow of good-nights in the home he’s trespassed are stubbornly contradicted by Shaw’s stage action. And above all when onlookers, would-be-ravisher and soon-to-be-victim sing as endlessly as an old-fashioned Italian quartet before taking the plunge into horror. Blame part of that on the lack of tension in Nicholas Collon’s conducting - what went wrong? - and the surprising fuzziness in the sound of the 13 Glyndebourne Tour players in what should be a biting, incisive score.There are good ideas: Lucretia revealed buried up to her neck, the poignancy of giving her a young daughter (April Gautrey-Saunders), the tableau of the classical protagonists and their chorus-counterparts mirroring each other in sleep, statue fragments laid out Christ-like on the cross. But too much business betrays the clearer purpose of the score. Kate Valentine as the Female Chorus, clear of diction and sympathy, would have us more on her side if Shaw didn’t get her to pace about too much in wild concern for man’s inhumanity to woman. Rock moves not panther-like but lumberingly to his destiny - the unavoidable resemblance to Prince Harry in Afghanistan doesn’t help - and occasionally lacks thrust at the extremes of the range; the soliloquy of “Within this frail crucible of light”, though, is beautifully sung.David Soar’s rock-solid Collatinus and above all the sense of total understanding in every word sung by Catherine Wyn-Rogers, the most experienced and best-projecting singer on the stage, as sensible maid Bianca (downstage above with Ellie Laugharne's Lucia, Valentine and Huckle) make the most consistent amends, but it’s not quite enough. It was a great idea to have Shaw follow up Deborah Warner’s Glyndebourne take on Don Giovanni with another two fingers up to the male “she really wanted to be raped” theory. The result, sadly, is a show as blunt as most of the libretto’s clunking images. The fault of Britten and Duncan, or Glyndebourne and Shaw? See it, make up your own minds. Mine is still confused but not inclined to see The Rape of Lucretia again in a hurry.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/rape-lucretia-glyndebourne-tour,3
475,"Les Vêpres Siciliennes, Royal Opera",Les Vêpres Siciliennes,Royal Opera,2013-10-18,David Nice,"First fanfare had to be for the Royal Opera House’s main gambit in Verdi bicentenary year, staging its first ever Sicilian Vespers 158 years after the Paris premiere. Any of Verdi’s operas from Rigoletto onwards deserves the red carpet treatment, and this unwieldy epic, with its opportunistic grafting of a melodramatic plot on to the Palermitans’ massacre of the French in 1282, has more than enough vintage music to be worthy of anyone’s close attention. What’s more, Antonio Pappano is surely the best opera-house music director in the world to reveal its colours and beauties, and he rose to a noble challenge.A second round of trumpets in a meaner key sounded for me on learning that eternally inconsistent prima donna Marina Poplavskaya would not be singing the first three performances, her place taken by the reputedly more reliable Lianna Haroutounian. And solemn trombones heralded the UK debut of Norwegian director Stefan Herheim, much feted on the continent.Both high hopes were only half fulfilled. Herheim’s thought-through consistency, and his bane, is to set the whole thing in an opera house circa 1855, the year of the first performance, and to give the opera the unofficial subtitle The Ballet Master’s Revenge. True, some back history in the plot needs exposition, and Herheim takes the opportunity to speed through it while Pappano set up high expectations with the tense rhythms and the one glorious melody of the Overture. The French burst in on preparations for a rehearsal – of Giselle, possibly – wounding Erwin Schrott’s inappropriately effete choreographer Procida, Sicilian patriot in the original, and commander Guy de Montfort (Michael Volle) proves himself a 30-second man in a risible ""rape"" of a ballerina. Cue the child who will grow up to be a freedom-fighter for the Sicilian cause, Henri (stalwart tenor Bryan Hymel, with a heavily symbolic boy actor as his younger self).The advantage in this is a sequence of striking stage pictures beautifully lit by Anders Poll and graced by Philipp Führhofer's adaptable set, hinting at Siciliana in two murals; the two sides of that extraordinary island are stylised in an erupting volcano with classical ruins on the one hand, a pastoral scene on the other. The walls and opera loggias move far more gracefully than two of the singers. Haroutounian as hostage to the French Hélène and Hymel (pictured above in Act Four) carry out the usual stand and deliver stuff: is Herheim trying to make a virtue of necessity by making everything that Verdi’s Donna Anna and Don Ottavio do or sing theatre? His dramaturg Alexander Meier-Dörzenbach enlightens us in the programme: “the actual conflict in this production…is not about nationalities or politics, but about illusion and disillusion of and within the theatre.”So that’s fine only when Herheim’s concept doesn’t betray Verdi’s. The first two acts are full of rather stiff musical ideas being tried out for size. The few glories rest with the orchestra, the violins of which under Pappano are more seductive singers than anyone on stage. We have high hopes for Schrott’s posturer but this very loud bass overshoots the mark and very often the pitch in a wild account of Procida’s Act Two aria. And that act's weak if experimental curtain is confused when Verdi’s boat of partygoers turns into a group of skull-masked zombies in clouds of dry ice.So far, so what. Then in Act Three the music, the drama and the singing go up several notches as Volle (pictured above) provides the star turn of the evening in phrasing and projecting with great distinction a beautiful, starkly orchestrated romance about the son he needs to win over. The quality remains Verdi’s best in the duet with Hymel’s Henri, both men getting to sing the opera’s most memorable melody (the one already heard in the Overture).Erwin Schrott and Royal Opera Chorus in the Act Five denouementThe big function at which the freedom fighters are stalled by Henri’s new found filial duty is shorn of the superb ""Four Seasons"" ballet music we were originally promised.  True, the cut is an option Verdi later permitted; if only there had been time for the Royal Ballet, withdrawn from the project and replaced by freelance dancers after original choreographer Johan Kobborg had ""artistic differences"" with Herheim, to resuscitate Kenneth MacMillan’s stand-alone choreography on intervening evenings.  At least the main ballet's absence allows the opera to move swiftly to its first major crisis via a Masked Ball situation and Traviata-style party music. The massive ensemble, delivered out front, also delivers at the highest Verdian level.More quality shines in Act Four: Hymel just about brings off Henri’s high-lying aria, surely the closest Verdi ever came to unorthodox Berlioz – who admired this work, by the way – and Haroutounian has her moments in a duet foreshadowing the one between the Infante and Elisabetta in Act Two of Don Carlo, though she can’t float a high, sweet line (Poplavskaya can, one respect in which she may score over her temporary replacement).Execution of Hélène and Procida averted, the onstage theatre brought out shiny once more from under scaffolding, we’re returned to operatic parody in Act Five, pretty wedding numbers for the lovers – again a bit hit and miss – and Herheim’s problem of what to do with the nuptial “I do” signal for the massacre infinitely postponed by conventional trios. The end of this production misfires, but so too, perhaps, does Verdi’s at a time when his sense of music-theatre was still sometimes compromised by the set-piece formula. Not a bad evening, then, worthy neither of the boos nor the ecstatic cheers in the auditorium. The main thing is that we’ve got to hear a curate’s egg by a true master in its original language, and for that I at least am profoundly grateful.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/les-v%C3%AApres-siciliennes-royal-opera,3
476,"Madam Butterfly, English National Opera",Madam Butterfly,English National Opera,2013-10-15,Mark Valencia,"When the going gets tough, wheel out a crowd-pleaser. Even by its own volatile standards English National Opera has had a poor start to its autumn season, with productions of Fidelio and Die Fledermaus that seem destined to join the company’s ever-growing chamber of unrevivable horrors. ENO’s cash-strapped board must therefore be lighting another candle to the late Anthony Minghella, whose glacially delicate Madam Butterfly is always good for an outing.It’s an award-winning favourite that was mounted with extraordinary sensitivity by a director better known for his film work. Cards on the table: it’s a staging I find infuriating, yet despite myself I relished the chance to wallow again in its gorgeousness. If you haven’t seen it before, don’t let me put you off. A feast for the eye is guaranteed.The visual language is a paean to the ritualised beauty of traditional Japanese art – a decision that would be ideal were it not for the contradictory mood of Puccini’s score, which drips with Italian fervour. The story of Cio-Cio San, a young geisha whose night of pleasure with US Naval Lieutenant Pinkerton means so much more to her than it does to him, is a heartbreaking tale of devotion, rejection and despair. Inevitably, though, in directing this latest revival Sarah Tipple has stayed faithful to Minghella’s blueprint – which means that scenes like the erotic Act One love duet still flounder. Although ravishing to behold with its sea of hand-held lanterns and scattered rose petals, the tenor of idealised love versus rampant sexuality is completely neutralised by a wash of ostentatious, Kabuki-scented prettiness.The Italian conductor Gianluca Marcianò made a distinguished house début, shaping Puccini’s rich, cod-exotic orchestrations with exemplary balance and securing ensemble work from the ENO Chorus and Orchestra that was at once precise and relaxed. He was wholly attentive to the needs of his solo singers; it was certainly not his fault that Timothy Richards’s smallish voice failed to cut past the footlights and caused his Pinkerton to make such a disappointingly pale impression.With far richer vocal colours and a heartbreaking engagement with her character, the Russian-American soprano Dina Kuznetsova was a revelation as Cio-Cio San. Her full-blooded timbre, darker of hue than we usually hear in this girlish role, lent a mournful flavour to her performance and made for an exceptional partnership with mezzo Pamela Helen Stephen’s wonderfully sung, fully-realised Suzuki. The silent collapse of Stephen’s face on learning the truth about Pinkerton was reactive acting of the highest order.Cio-Cio San's wedding guests in Act One of ENO's Madam ButterflyIt is always a pleasure to see baritone George von Bergen’s name on a roster: he is a very fine operatic actor. His bumbling Sharpless, the bluff but baffled American Consul, was a characteristically well-delineated creation that more than made up for an atypically unfocused vocal performance. Only an off-night I hope. There were strong cameos from Alun Rhys-Jenkins as the marriage-broker Goro, Mark Richardson as the intimidating Bonze, Alexander Robin Baker as Prince Yamadori (Butterfly’s would-be suitor) and, especially, from a clear-voiced Catherine Young as poor Kate Pinkerton.The fifth principal in Madam Butterfly is Sorrow, Cio-Cio San’s son – a challenging part for a young child to carry off successfully, albeit one that was managed with moving aplomb by a very small boy at Opera Holland Park earlier this year. In 2005, when this ENO production first appeared, Minghella (pictured below) famously rejected the human option in favour of the fabulous puppetry of Blind Summit – and four revivals in it still doesn’t work. The problem is simple and should have been obvious to such a gifted director: however ingenious the manipulation by three skilled Bunraku puppeteers, it only serves to draw the audience away from an emotional connection with Pinkerton's innocent offspring and into a mood of detached admiration for the sheer cleverness of it all. The portrayal has a certain wooden charm but it is no substitute for a flesh-and-blood child whose vulnerability might awaken the spectator’s protective instincts. To watch human hands bring a telescope to a puppet’s eye is distracting, not affecting.The real hero of Minghella’s Madam Butterfly is Peter Mumford, who is responsible for the ingenious lighting. It is impossible to overstate Mumford’s role in defining the production: his work breathes life into Michael Levine’s opulently spare designs and transforms an almost bare, almost flat rectangular stage into an epic world. The penumbral lighting of motionless singers in Act One (see top of page) turned them for one extraordinary moment into an array of icons, the variegated satin of their costumes made to resemble the painted models of Cio-Cio San’s ancestors. It was just one dazzling effect in a production that is bathed in beauty from first to last. If only it were more than skin-deep.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/madam-butterfly-english-national-opera-0,4
477,"Jason/Agrippina, English Touring Opera",Jason/Agrippina,English Touring Opera,2013-10-09,alexandra Coghlan,"English Touring Opera has form when it comes to baroque opera. Handelfest in 2009 marked the composer’s 250th anniversary with a sequence of excellent stagings, while 2010’s The Duenna was a riotous and irreverent musical delight, and there was an Alcina back in 2005 that still sticks in the memory for all the right reasons.So a season of three period productions – Monteverdi’s L’incoronazione di Poppea, Cavalli’s Jason and Handel’s Agrippina – promised much. Some careful repertoire choices, deft direction, and the added enticement of a return to the Royal College of Music’s intimate Britten Theatre all played their part, but performances themselves proved oddly uneven.Even by baroque’s baggy standards Cavalli’s Jason is a monster, and demands significant cuts to streamline it for a contemporary audience. Ronald Eyre’s performing edition is brutally efficient, bringing proceedings down to a brisk just-over-an-hour for each half. Inevitably this means that characters and encounters are jettisoned. Three acts become two and Jason’s wife Isiphile, for example, doesn’t make an appearance until the second. It’s a deferral that actually heightens dramatic tension nicely, creating an elegant balance between the mirror halves of the opera – the first at Colchis with Medea and the second on Lemnos where the philandering Jason is reunited with his wife.Director Ted Huffman places us in an uncomplicated no-time, no-place, framed with elegant simplicity by Samal Blak’s sets – a faintly Baltic blend of Gustavian style and gentle off-whites. In Hannah Pedley’s Medea we also have a heroine who is also decidedly off-white, but this retelling of the tale places less blame with her as magical seductress than with Jason himself (Clint van der Linde). The plot is freely adapted from mythology, offering an unusually domestic take on a tale of heroism that generally favours battles over romance.Cavalli’s uniquely flexible and chromatically-infused arioso style is well suited to a drama that slips constantly between joy, high comedy and tragedy. Music and mood can turn on a dime, without having to lug an extended da capo behind them, and when it does break into aria – tiny, simple melodies – the effect is disarmingly effective. Dance permeates the writing and thanks to the athletic (if occasionally rather approximate) work of the Old Street Band under Joseph McHardy, it swings and snaps with percussive energy.The score is hero here, carrying some rather uneven singing through an evening that charms more than it impresses vocally. Pedley’s Medea (pictured above) is seductive and competently delivered, but occasionally sits just under the note, curdling the sweetness of her blandishments. An ailing van der Linde failed on opening night to relish Cavalli’s swooning arcs of melody, offering a strangely muted performance in which he was dwarfed by both his rival women. Catrine Kirkman’s Isiphile was sweetly sung, never over-weighting the composer’s delicate lines, while a surprisingly tender Delfa from Michal Czerniawski, a cleanly comic Orestes (Piotr Lempa, pictured below with Peter Aisher) and a stand-in Demus (Aisher, stuttering wonderfully) rounded out a true ensemble cast.Agrippina is up there with Handel’s most melodious scores, and with a plot more cynical than most makes a natural fit for a contemporary audience sick of sudden repentances and deathbed conversions. Led by Gillian Webster’s Agrippina, the cast plotted and schemed their way through intrigue after intrigue under James Conway’s intelligent direction. Blak’s designs offered their own share of wryness, jostling for our attention with some of the foreground interplay.Webster (pictured below) is supremely good – a joyous flourish of coloratura and focused tone, shrugging off da capo embellishments with careless ease. Did we truly believe her as an evil Machiavel? Not a bit of it, but luckily Handel’s story doesn’t take us through to Agrippina’s bloody endgame. Paula Sides makes for a minxy Poppea, more assured dramatically than vocally, despite having to contend with the limp van der Linde as lover Ottone. Any energy lacked by van der Linde was more than supplemented by Jake Arditti’s manic Nerone however – ferociously camp and hurling runs at us with desperate intensity.Jonathan Peter Kenny certainly wasn’t hanging about with the tempos. Ranging from brisk to breakneck, some sections fared better than others. The overture was a joy, and the closing dance, but to take “Vaghe fonti” at a canter is to lose the throbbing intensity of its rhythms and suggestive wind writhings. And as for Claudio’s gorgeous little cavatina “Viena O Cara” – it may be sung by a buffoon in determined seduction, but it deserves just a little more indulgence and phrasing than Kenny or Andrew Slater afforded it. Slips of intonation and ensemble from the Old Street Band didn’t help matters, but surely these details will settle as the run progresses.Two mixed evenings then, but despite smudges and the odd bit of miscasting both ETO’s productions leave their mark in a sense of ebullient energy. You feel very well entertained on leaving the theatre, and isn’t that what it’s all about? Herr Handel would doubtless have had some stern words, but free from his reproving gaze the rest of us can get on with having a good time.English Touring Opera's Jason and Agrippina tour the UK until 24 November, 2013",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/jasonagrippina-english-touring-opera,3
478,"Roberto Devereux, Welsh National Opera",Roberto Devereux,Welsh National Opera,2013-10-03,stephen Walsh,"Whatever it was about the kings and queens of England that so intrigued Donizetti, it certainly wasn’t their politics. The third, and last, in WNO’s autumn cycle shows Elizabeth once again in a state of unrequited love with one of her rebellious (and much younger) nobility, but wholly unconcerned with affairs of state; and the one thing that distinguishes her from the average abandoned woman of Romantic opera is that she has the power to decapitate her uncooperative swains. Freud would have nodded sagely; but it’s unlikely that Donizetti was thinking of emasculation.Though neglected, Roberto Devereux is by no means a pure Wexford-style no-hoper. Uneven it may be, and prone to fall back, like so much bel canto opera, on a repertoire of more or less mechanical rhythmic and harmonic devices. But it also has two or three scenes as powerful as anything in Donizetti’s better known work. The title character is the selfsame Earl of Essex of Gloriana fame, home from the Irish campaign against Tyrone and eager to resume his adulterous affair with the young Duchess of Nottingham. Unfortunately the queen is also in love with him, turns against him when she realizes he is otherwise engaged, agonizes over whether or not to countermand Parliament’s death sentence for treason, then eventually does so but too late.Some of these situations ring bells from Maria Stuarda. But the balance is musically very different. We again get two sopranos, but there is no confrontation. Elizabeth rules the upper registers, while Sara, the duchess, weeps at home. Donizetti uses the queen’s coloratura cleverly to depict her unstable emotional condition, torn between command and helpless passion as she tries desperately, an aging, over-powdered woman, to extract some response from Devereux beyond superficial loyalty. Alexandra Deshorties (pictured right with Capalbo) – hideously made up with dyed red hair piled up above gaunt features and withered bosom – is brilliantly convincing in all this; and Leonardo Capalbo’s reaction – embarrassed, trapped, evasive – is likewise precise, though his dignity isn’t greatly helped by director Alessandro Talevi kitting him out in cheap leathers, like some Milanese taxi-driver.Later, there are superb scenes for Nottingham himself, the cuckolded but unsuspecting husband, with Devereux, and (no longer unsuspecting) with his poor, defenceless wife – music in which Donizetti achieves a near-Verdian intensity; and on the other hand a dramatically important scene with Elizabeth that relapses into pure Italian rum-te-tum. At such moments, the composer seems to have handed his work to a typewriter. But they are mostly outweighed. And though I don’t much care for Talevi’s settings or Madeleine Boyd’s designs – the same kinds of monochrome airport lounge as in the two previous operas enlivened by back-silhouettes and bizarre props including an enormous spider-machine on which Elizabeth rides against Devereux – the actual stage direction is very powerful and makes the most of Donizetti’s genius for vocal fisticuffs.A strong cast helps make this work. Deshorties is a soprano of real character and athleticism, and a striking figure on the stage, towering over Capalbo, himself no mean bravura tenor, if not exactly such as to have made the Irish shake in their shoes. The best of several males who, with one motive or another, circle round the queen is David Kempster in the baritone role of Nottingham, the wronged husband (though we know Sara to have been forced into marriage), initially warm in his affection for Devereux, violently recriminatory of his wife, Leah-Marian Jones, a much lighter, sweeter soprano than Deshorbies, but equally stylish in her way. Geraint Dodd is also excellent in the latest incarnation of the by now elderly (and in historical fact actually dead) William Cecil. But what did history matter to Donizetti? It was situations he adored.Daniele Rustioni returns to conduct, and again, as in Anna Bolena, has one admiring the composer’s orchestral ear when one wearies of the um-chahs. Orchestra and chorus take as much care as if this were Rigoletto or Aida, as they have done throughout the cycle: and it's not wholly unmerited.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/roberto-devereux-welsh-national-opera,3
479,"The Wasp Factory, Linbury Studio Theatre",The Wasp Factory,Linbury Studio Theatre,2013-10-03,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"A baby's brain is polished off by a throbbing welter of maggots. A field of sheep are on fire. A screaming child whose hands have been tied to a kite is flying out over the North Sea. How do you make an opera out of any of this? The answer of course is you don’t. You leave this kind of thing to cinema or the novel. Opera is - contrary to popular belief - extremely bad at spectacle, especially if the aim is to terrify. Horror has never had much of a look-in as a genre in the art form. So it was always going to be a challenge for composer Ben Frost and librettist David Pountney to transfer Iain Banks’s richly horrific cult book The Wasp Factory to the opera stage.The horror that propels the story forward was substantially cut by Pountney. Frank, the boy protagonist, is no longer the active sadist of the Banks novel, murdering his relatives in ever more elaborate ways, massacring animals with gruesome relish, seeking redemption through death like a trainee Richard Wagner. In the Frost remake he is a schizophrenic fantasist, who relates the basics and does little else. He is also a she – part of a plot twist that isn’t much delved into in the opera and can only make sense if you’ve read the book. And she becomes they, as three female performers act out Frank’s dark fantasies while writhing around in a pit of earth like worms.While it’s probably wise that Frost and Pountney sidestepped any literal representation of the savagery, it does mean that you get little sense of the main attraction of the book, namely its graphic descriptions of death and destruction. The handy thing about opera is you get a second and third chance to tell the story if you at first fail with words. Visuals came most successfully to the aid of the work. Mirella Weingarten’s simple but ever restless square crater of soil - which seeks to rid itself of the three figures crawling around in it - had its moments, especially when it was left to deliver its tableaux in silence. The acting (which was being directed by Frost himself) was less interesting in the way it went through familiar hysterical motions. It was also wasteful of an element of the novel that is so effective: the way the boy behaves in most respects (outside of his murdering) quite normally.The music could have saved the production’s bacon had Frost stuck to what he does best. But his famous, attractively dense electroacoustic soundscapes – that hover seductively between noise, drone, ambient sound and pop - were fleeting. There were two glorious slabs of cleverly manipulated high and low sound at the start and end that seemed to suggest the act of boring into a brain. But the rest of it chugged away in a pappy postminimal language orchestrated for a quintet of strings that came very close to backing-band territory and sounded suspiciously like someone attempting ""to write an opera"", rather than someone seeking to make the best sounds in response to specific sentiments faced. If we ignore the derivative, Bjork-like vocal lines - all shaped into very conventional aria, trio and recititative forms - the singers, Liselot De Wilde, Mariam Wallentin and Jordin Richter, did a good job.Whether one thinks of Damon Albarn’s Dr Dee or Nitin Sawhney’s Entanglement, it is so often the most supposedly ""radical"", cross-genre collaborations that produce the most conservative results. The same has sadly happened again.",https://theartsdesk.com/new-music/wasp-factory-linbury-studio-theatre,2
480,"Die Fledermaus, English National Opera",Die Fledermaus,English National Opera,2013-10-01,Geoff Brown,"Rich, racy, randy and irreverent: such were the R words gathered up by a Canadian critic to capture the essence of Christopher Alden’s production of Johann Strauss’s cork-popping operetta when it premiered in Toronto last year. Other R words, alas, came to my mind, like rubbish, reprehensible, risible, even rigor mortis.Had this co-production between the Canadian Opera Company and English National Opera changed so much on its journey across the Atlantic? It seems unlikely, beyond the difference in language. Canada experienced the show in the libretto’s original German; ENO, sticking to their remit, offer an English translation by Stephen Lawless and Daniel Dooner, plausible enough if not exactly a bower of delight. But that still leaves us with the crushing burden of Alden’s concept and direction.This is a man who puts the horrid word “societal” into a programme note not once but twice; and his eagerness to make this masterpiece of Viennese operetta seem relevant, edgy and streetwise leads him to introduce into the plot’s marital farce lashings of Sigmund Freud, perversity, crazed violence – just the things you want to bear in mind as you sip Strauss’s delicious champagne.Dominating Allen Moyer’s set is an enormous pocket watch, hanging, sometimes swinging, above as a cheerful reminder of mortality; a tool of hypnosis, too. In Alden’s reading, Dr Falke, the puppeteer behind the opera’s revenge plot, morphs into Sigmund Freud himself, notebook in hand as he analyse the characters’ dreams and secret desires. That in itself isn’t a particularly bad notion: many operetta plots aside from Fledermaus deal, usually daintily, with freedom battling repression and characters rebelling against social boundaries. But when it leads Prince Orlofsky to leap and shout like a psychopathic orang-utan, and populates his Act Two party with a choking gallimaufry of tottering cross-dressed males (a coach party, probably, from Weimar Germany), you get the sense of a point being driven home far too crudely and too far.It doesn’t help that there is so little of visual interest to snare and captivate the audience. Aside from the watch, there’s the Eisensteins’ isolated and pompous bed, ENO’s trusty circular back wall, an isolated grand staircase airlifted in from MGM’s 1936 cupcake The Great Ziegfeld – and that’s it. The hollow spaces on the stage don’t help the audibility of the dialogue: one reason perhaps why much of the production’s “comedy” on press night generated the frosty silence once reserved for variety comedians failing to win over Glasgow. Filling the gaps with the gay gallimaufry and the overture’s batgirls (costumed by Constance Hoffman in another crib from The Great Ziegfeld) wasn’t the best solution.But the biggest and saddest nail in Alden’s coffin comes from the cast’s characterisations. It’s not all their fault: if Alden insists on turning Orlofsky (a trouser role) into a neurotic nutcase or make the lawyer Blind weird beyond belief, there’s not much that Jennifer Holloway and Simon Butteriss can do, apart from secretly groan. Even so, Jan Pohl’s fascist jailor Frosch – he lacks only the swastika armband – is spectacularly unconvincing. There’s a lack of confidence and sharp style about many other players too. Tom Randle and Julia Sporsén struggle to bring individuality to Eisenstein and his wife, while Rhian Lois’s silvery trills as the maid Adele (pictured above left) need more lung power behind them to properly bewitch.Tiresome though Alden’s spin becomes, Richard Burkhard’s Freudian Dr Falke is at least dispatched with rigour. Better yet are Andrew Shore as Frank, the prison governor, and Edgaras Montvidas as Rosalinde’s warbling amour Alfred. As soon as they arrive they occupy the stage: they have presence, charisma, stylish wit, ingredients very thin on the ground elsewhere. Down in the orchestra pit, Eun Sun Kim, a rising (female) conductor from South Korea, injects the ENO orchestra with a modest degree of waltzing lilt, though never quite enough fizz. Understandable in the circumstances: she was looking at this wretched production too.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/die-fledermaus-english-national-opera,2
481,"Peter Grimes, LPO, Jurowski, Royal Festival Hall",Peter Grimes,LPO,2013-09-29,David Nice,"For Londoners unable to travel up to Aldeburgh – or, now, to Leeds for the revival of Phyllida Lloyd’s Opera North production – this was the only chance in Britten centenary year to be blitzed by his seminal masterpiece. After the phenomenal success of the Proms’ Wagner semi-stagings, even the craft and sure-footedness of Daniel Slater’s direction here was never going to be a substitute for Grimes in the opera house (or on the beach), serving only to show that this is a supreme music drama least happily separated from the theatre.Yet there were other virtues; given today’s most accomplished interpreter of the violent-visionary fisherman, Stuart Skelton, and a conductor in Vladimir Jurowski always poised hawk-like to claw revelatory new detail from the score, the musical performance was still as unforgettable as they come.Skelton gives an heroic-tenor Grimes, currently alternating in equal heroism or foolhardiness with his Florestan at English National Opera. That means gains in the elemental force and a few losses in subtler tone colours – though he has refined his musical reading enormously since the 2009 ENO performances. You might have been inclined to weep – I was – at his very first not-all-there echoes of the coroner’s oath-reading in the inquest for the suspicious death of his young apprentice. I was also moved to tears, in the pub on the night of the storm, less at the rapt solo of “Now the great bear”, where others have lit up more hauntingly the sustained high E which was creator Peter Pears’ money note, than at Grimes going mad with the edgy release of the manic round ""Old Joe has gone fishing"" (magnificently dispatched by the ensemble here).The monologue in Grimes’ hut, constructed in Alex Doidge-Green’s designs evocatively but a touch distantly on the left of the platform above the orchestra, suggested less of the schizoid than the late and peerless Philip Langridge’s manner, and despite the ludicrously overdone programme biography’s insistence on Skelton's ""beautiful voice"" – agents’ blurbs need serious editing – there’s less tonal caressing than we once got, earlier in his career, from fellow heldentenor Ben Heppner. But there’s no-one around now to give a more vivid account of this difficult and harrowing role.Jurowski (pictured above by Chris Christodoulou) applied to the music's twists and turns a neat but lethal surgical knife rather than Kafka’s famous image of great art’s ice-axe through the frozen sea. His approach went for whiplash intensity, avoiding the deep waters previously charted by Mark Wigglesworth at Glyndebourne – a reading which time has vindicated on a CD archive release – or Haitink at the Royal Opera, at least until we reached a crucial Passacaglia variation at the heart of the opera. This and the other interlude not included in the concert-hall group of four, pre-empting Grimes’s mad scene in the fog, blinded us with magnesium-flare projections of Britten’s sparest sounds, London Philharmonic strings lean and hungry.American soprano Pamela Armstrong, a vivacious Rosalinde in Jurowski’s Glyndebourne Fledermaus, sobered up as sympathetic widow Ellen Orford and in spite of an occasionally frayed upper register, brought real artistry to the role, rising to the expressive challenges of the great “Embroidery Aria”. A year and a half off 70, Alan Opie remains in good voice as the Balstrode of choice, and among a strong mostly-British supporting cast Mark Stone projected every word with meaty baritone sound as jack-the-lad apothecary Ned Keene.From my seat far back, not everything could be heard from veteran Jean Rigby’s Mrs Sedley and Pamela Helen Stephen’s pub-brothel landlady – strong characterizations both, and while perhaps you really need an old-bag mezzo for the buttoned-up laudanum addict, there’s no reason why “Auntie” shouldn’t be an attractive woman: the bright tops sported by her and her ""nieces"" – Malin Christensson and Elizabeth Cragg, excellent in the Straussian quartet - suggested that they alone bring colour to the Borough.Apart from the highlighted infelicities in Montagu Slater's text - though there are strong lines too, its missed lobs at high-flown poetry were emphasised by having re-appreciated Auden's libretto for Paul Bunyan only a couple of weeks earlier - the only shame was on a professional choir, the London Voices, for uneasily sporting scores, not allowed in the Proms Wagner. 20 more voices would have given us the sea-wall of sound we needed at feral climaxes. Otherwise so much of the right atmosphere was there, and never more so than in Tim Mascall’s lights on the new Festival Hall organ's glitter-of-waves pipes. What a handsome performing space this now is, enhanced by Slater D’s semi-staging, and I can’t wait to hear those pipes in action.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/peter-grimes-lpo-jurowski-royal-festival-hall,4
482,"A Midsummer Night's Dream, Opera North",A Midsummer Night's Dream,Opera North,2013-09-29,graham Rickson,"All starts with a barely perceptible bass rumble, before Britten’s lower strings begin their queasy glissandi, shifting key signature every few seconds. It’s a wonderful operatic opening, here teased out with deft mystery by conductor Stuart Stratford.One of many surprises in this polished revival of Martin Duncan’s 2008 production is the look of Johan Engels’s forest. There’s no greenery, but lots of translucent perspex. Giant plastic balloons drift uncertainly. Bruno Poet’s funky lighting shimmers. All that’s missing is a giant lava lamp. Shakespeare’s fairies look here like primary schoolchildren dressed for PE, finished off with alarming blonde wigs which can’t help recalling the sinister incomers from John Wyndham’s Village of the Damned.Duncan’s swinging update ultimately does the opera proud; Britten purists may object to the broad humour and occasional vulgarity, but how refreshing it is to be in an opera house rippling with genuine belly laughter, not just the polite tittering uttered by the cognoscenti when they’ve recognised an erudite directorial in-joke. There are moments when you’re reminded of a cheesy 1960s film farce – Lysander and Demetrius wearing exquisitely tailored paisley suits, then stripping off and chasing one another whilst sporting comedy underpants. Daniel Ableson’s leery, edgy Puck sports shiny red shorts that are a little too brief, his behaviour suggesting that he’s forgotten to take his Ritalin tablet. Puck’s unhealthy relationship with James Laing’s Oberon is brilliantly spelt out in the early scenes; he bounds about like an unruly mongrel desperate to please an abusive owner.Seeing such a physically lively production increases one’s admiration for Britten’s score – with every kink and quirk in the music reflected in Ben Wright’s choreography. The mechanicals’ rehearsal is hysterically funny, as John Savournin’s uptight Peter Quince attempts to impose authority on his unruly cast. Their performance near the close of Act 3 is painted in the broadest of strokes, and is all the wittier for it – Nicholas Sharrat flounces beautifully as Flute, while Joseph Shovelton sports a scene-stealing brickwork suit as Snout. Their post-performance Bergamask is little more than six ungainly blokes doing a silly dance, but it’s sweetly done. Elsewhere, Sky Ingram and Kathryn Rudge as Helena and Hermia are well matched and physically perfect for their roles, with Andrew Glover and Quirijn de Lang suitably foppish as Lysander and Demetrius (pictured above, right).But you leave this opera haunted by Britten’s fairy music – reams of spectral harp arpeggios and glittering tuned percussion. Jeni Burn’s silver-clad Tytania vamps it up nicely with Henry Waddington’s Bottom, and Laing’s imposing Oberon is light-toned vocally but sufficiently eerie-sounding to raise one’s neck hairs. And those childrens’ voices are magnificent – I challenge anyone with a heart to remain dry-eyed during the closing chorus. You rather hope that Britten would have approved. Terrific, in other words.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/midsummer-nights-dream-opera-north,5
483,"Fidelio, English National Opera",Fidelio,English National Opera,2013-09-26,Edward Seckerson,"The first words we hear don’t belong to Fidelio at all. The first music does, but not at all where you expect to find it. If you’ve read your programme (and who does before the show begins?) you’ll find a poem entitled “Labyrinth” by Jorge Luis Borges from a collection In Praise of Darkness. So there’s the thinking behind the amazing image we see before us (designer Rebecca Ringst) - a neon-edged framework of shifting metallic chambers, a vertical maze with no apparent way in or way out. And then Edward Gardner throws down the first sepulchral chord of Beethoven’s Leonore No 3 Overture (sometimes interpolated between the last two scenes of the opera) and shadowy figures start emerging from the pit where the music has begun its slow ascent from darkness to light.Calixto Bieito, as we’ve seen from his previous shows at English National Opera, knows how to put an audience on the back foot. His nose for theatre, his desire to confound expectations, can be thrilling - and as the longest of the four overtures Beethoven wrote for his only opera is in effect a symphonic synthesis of the whole piece, a premonition, if you like, of the narrative to come, Bieito is immediately introducing a psychological element into the proceedings and creating “a prison of the mind”, an abstract theatrical treatise on the whole issue of personal and political freedom.So as Beethoven’s music works itself into a frenzy of activity, Florestan - the prisoner in us all - is all but bouncing off the imaginary walls of his cell in a kind of Martha Graham-esque excess of physical anguish, and those of us who know the opera are reminding ourselves that there was a very good reason why Beethoven and his librettists left him and his plight to the imagination until the second act.But Bieito has ditched the libretto, the spoken dialogue (problematic though it can be), and replaced it with odd snatches of poetry which make little sense to the uninitiated and only muddy the waters for us all. Out goes the domestic drama at the heart of the opera (and I do believe it’s there for a reason) and in comes the psychotherapy. And yet there is a sense in which Beethoven’s musical numbers are all you need, so complete are they in conveying the emotional import of the piece. For instance, when the infatuated Marzelline (the radiant Sarah Tynan, pictured right) first sees Fidelio (Stuart Skelton) - the disguised Leonore  - their eyes lock over the balmy string chords which introduce the sublime act one quartet, which expresses everyone’s feelings in barely five minutes. Who needs the dialogue or the poetry? Well, maybe those who’ve never seen the opera before.There are other instances of dramatic abbreviation and conflation in Bieito’s staging: the villainous Don Pizarro (Philip Horst) delivers his furious aria with his arm around Leonore’s neck and a knife at her throat - the shape of things to come, though again he’s taking liberties with the text. But it does intensify her great aria which now follows almost immediately - and Emma Bell sings that magnificently and in it shows us precisely who she is. Bell has the requisite mezzo colour for the role but also the big heroic top, and I have heard few who so successfully negotiate the virile runs and tricky switches of register through such exemplary breath control.And what a match of vocal heroics ENO achieved here with Stuart Skelton’s Florestan. He made the aria feel and sound so eminently singable with the hallucinatory vision of Leonore beautifully shaded. The ensuing reunion with Emma Bell (pictured left with Skelton) brought fireworks of joy and one phrase from Beethoven and Bell which spelled out his name in total adoration. But then came the most startling coup of the evening, with Bieito interpolating part of the searching third movement of Beethoven’s String Quartet Op 132 between the last two scenes where the Leonore No 3 Overture sometimes sits. As Florestan and Leonore take the first tentative steps towards rediscovering intimacy (or not) after their traumatic separation, heavenly music sounds from above and the members of the Heath Quartet are lowered from above in cages. You can imprison but not silence these individual voices who meld as one.Bieito’s reading of the jubilant final scene is cynical, to say the least, with the prisoners’ saviour, the minister Don Fernando (Roland Wood), portrayed as an 18th-century pantomime fop who dispenses justice with a marker pen, inscribing the word “FREE” on each prisoner’s name tag. I won’t reveal Bieito’s most shocking tactic, arriving as it does like a sick joke, but suffice to say that Edward Gardner and the ENO Chorus sweep all aside with the most hair-raising presto to the opera’s syncopated finish.An evening of hits and misses, then - puzzling, provocative, occasionally startling. Ultimately one has to ask whether or not Beethoven has been hijacked to serve Bieito’s purpose. There’s no easy answer to that. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/fidelio-english-national-opera,3
484,"Elektra, Royal Opera",Elektra,Royal Opera,2013-09-24,David Nice,"“Strike again,” cries Elektra as her brother stabs their mother to death. It’s third strike lucky for this Covent Garden production of Richard Strauss and Hugo von Hofmannsthal’s singular mythic horror. In previous manifestations of designer-director Charles Edwards’ rather over-freighted but ever improving staging, conductors Semyon Bychkov and Mark Elder, as well as top-less soprano Lisa Gasteen and the more nuanced but sometimes underpowered Susan Bullock, missed the heart of the matter. Known sensation Andris Nelsons and the much-anticipated Christina Goerke were much more likely to hit the mark.Which they mostly did, even if the total revelation lay elsewhere. Nelsons hits hard and loud from the start, with stunning emphasis on burrowing bass lines – Elektra’s search for the axe which felled father Agamemnon – and growling lower brass. Every one of Strauss’s illustrative textures for Hofmannsthal’s vivid images leaps out, especially the baying hounds and the beaked demons sucking guilty mother Klytämnastra’s blood. Nelsons knows how to be delicate and expressive with the moments of chamber music and draws us into the dream of Elektra’s lullaby for newly-regained brother Orest.Yet I still can’t forget how Christian Thielemann before his aggrandisement really did get the Royal Opera orchestra to play whole portions of this blood-red, jet-black monumental score as Strauss, with witty hyperbole, said he wanted – “like fairy music by Mendelssohn”. You can tell I’ve joined the bunch of oldies who say “but you should have seen…” when I add that if you think Goerke’s good (her Elektra pictured above) – and the crowd went wild at the end – you should have seen Birgit Nilsson, Hildegard Behrens, Gwyneth Jones or even Eva Marton in this house. This is exactly the right sort of hefty voice in the middle range, but the fast-vibratoed pressure prevents long lines from blossoming, and the top notes, though all there, sound constricted.That's especially obvious alongside the totally liberated, golden sounds of Adrianne Pieczonka, the revelation, as pampered, neurotic, child-yearning sister Chrysothemis. Hers are the money notes, the free and easy but always intense sound which establishes her as one degree away from coping with the title role (and why have we not seen this singer at Covent Garden since her fine Donna Anna back in 2002?).Pieczonka (pictured left) looks terrific, too, in one of Brigitte Reiffenstuel's costume designs which so wryly mirror Edwards's queasy mix of pre- and post-World War One fashions with ancient Greek accountrements. The essential magic, though, lies in the siblings’ interaction. Goerke’s characterization is by no means all savage domination; she’s a big woman, but she has big stricken, soulful eyes, too, and makes it quite clear that Elektra's hunger to be loved is still intensely human.Michaela Schuster as the boil ridden mad mother could sometimes do with more of Goerke’s quality of stillness. Nor can she hope to establish the moments of sympathy when Edwards has her immediately poised to cut the throat of a half-dead maid (Jennifer Check, who does a good job of crawling once she’s proved herself a rather wild Elektra in waiting in the first scene).Even so, an intelligent German singer’s realization of the juicy text is not to be underestimated, and her cautious advances to a daughter who seems to be in sympathetic mood are wonderfully coloured. Schuster has the upper-range strength for the crisis, too, the only area in which the previous regent, Felicity Palmer, was lacking. The awful anguish of Klytämnestra's daymares was the first point at which my flesh truly began to creep, which is right: Strauss goes deepest here, and a fine article in the programme by Chris Walton sheds further light on the mental problems of the composer’s own mother which surely led him to mine something truly disturbing here.The other crucial encounter is with a brother Elektra has just accepted as dead. Iain Paterson (pictured right) is now unquestionably a very fine artist, even if his voice inclines more to the baritonal than to the bass depths the role of Orest also requires. It’s here, in the great recognition scene, that Goerke needs more of the flames of tenderness that Bullock brought, though she just about pulls it off (no way would I want to see her Ariadne, mind).She’s amusing in her little come-hither finger wag and her desk-lamp semaphoring to the doomed Ägisth (welcome back to London, John Daszak) as Nelsons makes the strings swoon in Viennese waltz-parody. And the final scene where Elektra’s victory stomp can only end in death makes the pulses race and the head spin. I even buy Edwards’ ultimate symbolic overload when the singers are so much to the fore and Pieczonka nails every despairing note. Here music-drama’s unique capacity to attract and repel, exhilarate and depress simultaneously is dazzlingly well served by the conductor and singers of a Royal Opera revival which really kicks you in the guts. MORE RICHARD STRAUSS ON THEARTSDESKDer Rosenkavalier, Royal Opera (2009).

485,"American Lulu, Young Vic",American Lulu,Young Vic,2013-09-19,alexandra Coghlan,"We all know the drill: Wedekind’s Lulu is a page men have written on through the centuries, the canvas on which they have painted their desires, the feminine void they have filled. The patriarchy have appropriated her, and the perverts, and now it’s contemporary composer Olga Neuwirth’s turn.Neuwirth’s reworking of Berg’s unfinished opera (itself an adaptation of Wedekind’s Lulu plays) purports to voice the unvoiced, to empower the heroine to wrest her story out of the hands of men. What it actually does is add yet another palimpsest-layer to an already overladen archetype, denying Lulu her humanity once again, but this time in the name of emancipation.Taking advantage of Berg’s incomplete Act III, Neuwirth substitutes the traditional Friedrich Cerha performing edition with her own jazz-fuddled rewriting, ripping up Berg’s elegant palindrome of an ending and replacing it with a baffling musical revenge-fantasy in which Lulu claims the phallic gun and murders her lovers, killing with them (one supposes) the oppressive forces of racism, sexism and capitalism. Neuwirth relocates the action to mid-century America, using Martin Luther King and Rosa Parkes as sonic and emotional background music. The result is not so much of the period as in it; Lulu is a southern civil rights activist in the Sixties just as Lulu at a fancy-dress party might be a lion or Marilyn Monroe.The dialogue of Wedekind’s Lulu plays has been described as “unnatural, stylised, and at times even absurd”. The only compliment I can pay Neuwirth is that her libretto for Act III lives up in every way to the original. Her hack job on Acts I and II is rather less faithful however, cutting apparently arbitrary chunks of plot and music and hoping that enough of the audience is familiar with the original to be able to fill in the blanks (the hordes who left mid-show evidently weren’t). Henry James might have proved the intensifying potential of the ellipsis, but Neuwirth hasn’t got his touch.The world premiere production of American Lulu at Berlin’s Komische Oper was a flop. This current production by John Fulljames is the second, and proof that the problems are really with the piece and not just the presentation. Fulljames takes advantage of the endlessly flexible Young Vic space to create an appealing quasi-cabaret with Brechtian onstage dressing area, moving Lulu in and out of sight behind dangling bead curtains that turn us into imaginative voyeurs. Projected animations (Finn Ross) are a major mis-step however, offering a comic-strip reduction of missing scenes (including a mystifying Team America-esque puppet-rape of Eleanor (the Countess Geschwitz of this version), seemingly standing in for the cholera episode of the original.Neuwirth’s score, while lush in brass and wind, is melodically angular and sits awkwardly for the voice. Angel Blue’s Lulu (pictured above) makes you long to hear her sing the Berg straight, glistening-pure at the top and committing even to the most outlandish idiocies of the libretto. Physically she’s not entirely at ease, but then it’s hard to see how she could be, given the paradoxes of character Neuwirth’s reworking have created. Meaner and more nakedly manipulative than her original, this wild child has nothing to redeem her. Whether we learn more from a wicked woman who vanquishes her male foes than a victimised woman ultimately destroyed by them is moot.Transforming Geschwitz into a jazz singer (Jacqui Dankworth, condemned to sing every line into a Brechtian microphone, trailing its flaccid little tail around the stage) allows Neuwirth to incorporate the bluesy sensibility that becomes the most American thing about the show, but meshes poorly with the rest of the musical fabric. The London Sinfonietta play loudly throughout under Gerry Cornelius, sacrificing line for precision and nuance for emphasis. Paul Curievici’s Photographer and Robert Winslade Anderson’s Clarence cope well over it, but Donald Maxwell’s lack of vocal focus slips over into his characterisation too, rendering Dr Bloom (pictured left with Blue) curiously passive.American Lulu hasn’t much to say about Lulu, and still less to say about America. Civil rights, female emancipation, sexual morality and capitalist exploitation might make for good operatic buzzwords in the contemporary opera house, but they make for a pretty terrible evening.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/american-lulu-young-vic,1
486,"Le nozze di Figaro, Royal Opera",Le nozze di Figaro,Royal Opera,2013-09-17,David Nice,"Revivals, especially at Covent Garden, too often wrong-foot high expectations. This one should have shone, with two known treasures among the cast (Lucy Crowe and Luca Pisaroni), an experienced Mozart conductor in John Eliot Gardiner and a handsome-enough David McVicar production supervised by its original director (sorry, “Sir John” might slip off the tongue, ""Sir David"" does not; but when was the honours system ever logical?) Yet while Michael Grandage’s profoundly human Glyndebourne Figaro dazzled as well on tour as at its opening and, by all accounts, in this year’s festival, too much of the love, warmth and cohesion were missing here.The ensemble needs to be as near perfect as it can be. Here the Almavivas were outshone by their servants – seriously so in the charisma bypass of Christopher Maltman’s Count. Character might have been loaned him by the long hair and moustache of Grandage’s late Sixties hipster, but that wouldn’t have concealed the premature roughening of the voice which left Gardiner and the orchestra to provide focused fury in his vengeance aria.Maria Bengtsson (pictured right with Maltman) rose to her big number, ""Dove sono"", with warm soft singing and a radiant top, but it felt by comparison hard-pressed in Gardiner’s authentic-style approach – Act Two’s “Porgi, amor” even more so – and despite aristocratic bearing her tendency, like Maltman, to sing under the note in sometimes listless recitative and the often cloudy sound reduced her impact. Slightly flat of voice, too, was Renata Pokupić’s low-impact Cherubino, though she/he had one good stage moment, when Susanna and the music fizz to get the boy out of an awkward situation and he’s rigid with terror.Lucy Crowe, my singer of the year so far for her sublime Handel in Göttingen, threw the book of tricks at Susanna, as if not quite trusting the production: too much hand-waving and flouncing at first was pulled into focus for the disciplined and resourceful servant she needs to be in the second and third acts. Vocally she coloured so much so beautifully: I’m glad Gardiner allowed her and not the Countess the upper line in the Act Two trio, and by that stage the charm had really begun to work with the music-theatre number to which Susanna dresses up Cherubino (how could anyone with half an ear think this weak, as many commentators have?) Again, though, Gardiner’s unyielding conducting failed to let the ineffable garden serenade breathe as it should, though he did give Crowe licence for one golden note of pure ecstasy, the last long F.By that stage Luca Pisaroni (pictured left with Crowe) - already proven a finer servant than his master in Glyndebourne's 2010 Don Giovanni - had also struck warmth with his relatively monochrome but handsome bass-baritone. Thank goodness these two's last-minute role play livened up the final masquerade, stone dead up to this point in the weakest act visually of McVicar’s otherwise stylish post-Napoleonic setting. Their opening duets established the role of anger and distress in the true partnership that’s already there in Mozart’s instant dramatic miracle.The imposing presences of Helene Schneiderman’s randy Marcellina, Carlos Chausson’s fulminating Bartolo and Jean-Paul Fouchécourt’s camp music-master should have got more genuine laughs – and this time I’d have welcomed Marcellina’s Act Four aria, cut as usual – but the production made them try too hard (again, I think of the equivalent scenes at Glyndebourne and sigh). If only Gardiner had unwound to cast a rosy glow over Figaro’s reconciliation with his unexpected parents in the great Sextet. His overture fizzed, with bright brass – not once did I look at the superfluous business on stage – and there were plenty of illuminating orchestral details: the sly violas as the Count uncovers Cherubino, the string bristlings in the Act Two finale, the accents of the Fandango which made up for the lack of dance on stage. Yet, though undeserving of the loud curtain-call booing behind me - no one should be subjected to that - he didn’t seem to be in perfect sympathy with the singers. The glowing humanity that should surround each and every figure in the greatest operatic comedy of all time only fitfully glimmered.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/le-nozze-di-figaro-royal-opera-0,3
487,"Rigoletto, LSO, Noseda, Barbican",Rigoletto,LSO,2013-09-16,Jasper Rees,"This season opener was about closure too. The London Symphony Orchestra was back at the office last night, but this fresh stretch of concerts opened with an opera it has been performing while also acquiring a suntan in Aix-en-Provence. A new cast of singers replaced gaudy costumes and facepaint with elegant evening garb, and semi-acted their roles on the thin strip of forestage not occupied by the massed ranks of the orchestra.The concept of the concert performance has never had more enthusiastic support than at the recent run of seven Wagner operas, amounting to a gazillion hours without anachronistic sets and look-at-me lighting. As with Wagner, the colour is all there in the music with the other bicentenarian Verdi, and without having to compete with Robert Carsen’s production replete with nudes and clown kit, the LSO took this opportunity to act out its part in the clash of cymbals, the moan of the oboe, the skip of the first fiddles. From the first dread chords of the brass, the sun-baked, storm-lashed streets of 16th-century Mantua were colourfully summoned.For this the audience has Gianandrea Noseda to clap on the back. Any anxiety that there’s not much to feast the eyes in a concert rendition of an opera was allayed by an athletic, even gymnastic performance from the Milanese conductor. From his apprenticeship in St Petersburg under Gergiev, he has spent much of his career in the pit, where there is presumably less room to dance and pivot, crouch and jerk like a demented trampolinist than there was here. For half this performance his sharp features radiated intense immersion in the drama as the Gilda of Desirée Rancatore (pictured © Allegri) fell in love for the first time, Dimitri Platanias's Rigoletto bemoaned the theft of his daughter and Saimir Pirgu’s nonchalant Duke hymned the flightiness of womankind. Famously committed, Noseda outgunned himself so that in the pause between the second and third acts, he looked for all the world like a knackered boxer staggering back to the ringside corner to recuperate. Magnificent.This mostly southern European cast swaggered and glittered and emoted with an easy access to passion somehow beyond their northern neighbours. Rancatore’s “Gualtier Maldè!... Caro nome” soared and swooped. In his “È il sol dell'anima"" Pirgu radiated bronzed self-assurance of a lyric tenor in love with his talent to seduce. As for the splendidly square Platanias, to embody every doting father’s nightmare he never let his sad clown face slip as Monterone’s doomy curse worked its inexorable spell. A rare night at the opera found the men of the LSO Chorus by turns whispering and bawling. The applause at these things often seems to endure past the last train home, but this time, perchè no?",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/rigoletto-lso-noseda-barbican,5
488,"Maria Stuarda, Welsh National Opera",Maria Stuarda,Welsh National Opera,2013-09-14,stephen Walsh,"Last week Anne Boleyn, this week Mary Queen of Scots. Donizetti’s trawl through the Tudor monarchs and their victims was more a recurrent obsession than a systematic exploration. WNO, on the other hand, seem to be implying some Ring-like continuity.Maria Stuarda has a different director in Rudolf Frey, but the same designer, Madeleine Boyd; and court fashion hasn’t changed in the half-century or so since Anne Boleyn went to the block – the same unflattering black skirts and suitings, the same gloomy box interiors. Only Mary defies the monochrome motif with a plaid skirt and knee-length boots that wouldn’t disgrace a Scottish chat-show hostess.Despite the political context, Donizetti’s Henry VIII was driven mainly by his infatuations; and for Frey, much the same is true of the two queens in Maria Stuarda. His Elizabeth I, Adina Nitescu, is an eyelash-fluttering trollop in the happy position of being able to decapitate her rival for Leicester’s affections, while his Mary (Judith Howarth) is a Clydeside fishwife for whom extreme unction is an opportunity to take off her clothes and fondle her confessor. The sheer vulgarity of her eventual costume – not actually topless but hideously quasi-topless in tight leatherette – would beggar belief if it weren’t so in keeping with the general drift of the staging. Donizetti may not be Schiller, but his queens are something grander than mere name-calling floozies.For sure, Maria Stuarda is a stronger (and four years later) piece than Anna Bolena, and its dramatic power deserves respect. Not only does it contain, in the superbly unhistorical encounter of the two queens in the park at Fotheringay, one of the most arresting moments in Italian opera before Verdi, but in general it’s sharper, more concentrated, and musically more varied than its predecessor. Donizetti is now using an enriched harmonic vocabulary to reflect the tensions of character and plot, and a crisper rhetoric to keep the drama moving. Even in an unsympathetic production it compels, where Anna Bolena sometimes languishes. But like all Donizetti, it takes some singing.The cast here, as last week, is well up to the task, if not uniformly excellent. I like the range of colour and control in Nitescu’s voice, though she has her squally moments; and I like the character with which she handles Frey’s somewhat meretricious reading, though in the end it undermines the drama. Howarth, for me, is more problematic. She has moments of brilliance, and some spectacular top notes, but the voice isn’t uniformly secure, and the brilliancies sometimes seem to come from nowhere.The portrait, too, is unattractive. In the first scene (in which she plays no musical part), Frey has her caged in a box with glass sides – an exhibit backed by a distorting mirror – from which she emerges in the second scene huffy rather than mettlesome. Leicester’s preference is unconvincing; Elizabeth is at least coquettish, and has the power.Bruce Sledge (pictured above by Robert Workman) is all the same in fine, ringing voice, with that spinto quality that Robert McPherson’s otherwise well-sung Percy in Anna Bolena lacked. Alistair Miles is demoted from Henry VIII to Talbot, but survives the humiliation (including great loss of hair) impressively, and Gary Griffiths is a solid, just sufficiently sinister Cecil, whether hanging around upstage with his notebook or directing matters from the front. Rebecca Afonwy-Jones impresses in the small but omnipresent role of Mary’s companion, Anna.Graeme Jenkins conducts, for the most part stylishly and efficiently, one or two moments of vagrant ensemble apart. Donizetti’s orchestration always repays attention, and here there are lovely moments of dark string sonority and pure, rich brass. The chorus is also vital, treated sometimes in character, sometimes like a Greek chorus, standing aside, commenting helplessly, superb in either role, as always on this stage.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/maria-stuarda-welsh-national-opera,3

There were singers at the starts of their careers in that Royal Opera special – remember Susan Gritton and Mark Padmore, anyone? – but not enough: it ought to be a paradise for the young, and here it truly was.In my books, though, that ought to mean not just opera singers: if this latest showing had mixed its operatic protégés with music-theatre graduates, the whole thing might have pulsed even more with the life it needs. No such reservations, though, about the winsome English-language version of Cimarosa’s Il matrimonio segreto the following evening, in which choice voices put across the stage business with vivacious precision: an easier task in one sense, since this is merely a six-hander with the covers neatly shadowing as servants rather than a company show with 44 solo roles, but more difficult in another, since Cimarosa for all his charm was no Mozart, and needs zesty help, which he got. Still, on seven weeks' intensive rehearsal, double casts and a limited budget, BYO has done both operas proud.No doubt about it, though: the hymn to a brave New World which Britten and Auden fashioned so freshly in 1941 needs more chewing the cud. Is there really still any problem with labelling this American creation myth by hopeful Brits the confident work of quirky geniuses? Stephen Walsh thought so in his review of the Welsh youth production; I don't. The composer was never more liberated in his invention; there’s none of the knottiness and angularity which both fascinate and perplex in his later work. And Auden has been taken to task for sententiousness in his shaping of an archetypal American myth, but he usually undercuts it with his own earthy, if not by then totally digested, type of Cole Porterishness. Britten never had a better librettist, even if Eric Crozier and E M Forster came close.There are unforgettable hooks: the chorus’s “Once in a while the odd thing happens, once in a while the moon turns blue”; the Western Union Boy’s jaunty refrains (pleasantly hammed up by Dominick Felix here); the blues Quartet of the Defeated; Bunyan’s daughter Tiny keening in her beautiful lament for her dead mother; the gorgeous party pieces in the Christmas finale. William Kerley had the company working hard on designer Jason Southgate’s uncluttered set – a raised target circle flanked by brooms, minimal props and look, no video projection – and even if they couldn’t always move very confidently, the chorus could certainly sing.Ensemble words inevitably got lost, and Louise Kemeny’s vocally adorable Tiny sounded as if she were singing a foreign language (pictured above with Peter Kirk as Hot Biscuit Slim). But Christopher Jacklin’s ballad singer (pictured below with guitarist Steven Joseph) tackled the American vernacular to the manner born, and surely it’s better to have giant Bunyan verbalized in the flesh, as he so confidently was by Will Edelsten, than pre-recorded (the Fry experience in Wales): this is melodrama, after all, that needs to be immaculately timed.Samuel Smith as the loner intellectual bookkeeper Johnny Inkslinger needs to pull the voice into focus – is he really a tenor or a baritone? – but had plenty of handsome presence. Standouts in a hard-working cast include Emily Vine’s coloratura Fido – who but Britten and Auden would have so imagined the camp dog? – Alex Aldren, the most promising of the tenors, as limited cook Sam Sharkey (soup to Ben Benny’s beans) and Timothy Connor’s malcontent lunk Hal Helson. Peter Robinson kept the fine young players of the Southbank Sinfonia ticking over, not much more: the vitality could have been more keenly sprung, but Britten’s serious moments – including Act One’s night-chirruping, bullfrog-croaking curtain, a magical atmosphere added by the composer just before his death in 1976 when he overhauled a work he realised was better than he'd remembered – tugged at the soul as they always do.Otherwise, wide-eyed optimism is part of the period take on the American dream, with not an African American in sight (though the subject may not call for it; more seriously, there was no black singer in this cast) and only a belated piece of deserved cynicism when the animal trio seek deliverance from, among others, ""those who say Patriotism and mean Persecution”. At least the deliberate ingenuous air has a plausible ring in the mouths of the young and hopeful.Next page: Cimarosa's The Secret MarriageRosalind Coad, Bradley Travis, Frazer B Scott, Heather Lowe and Alice Rose Privett in the Act One Finale of The Secret MarriageThe mature and assured, though, seemed to be holding the reins for The Secret Marriage. I’ve been harsh on Martin Lloyd-Evans’s productions of Francesca da Rimini and The Pirates of Penzance, where less would always have been more; but the gags which he uses to breeze along this uncomplicated opera buffa are so deftly executed by the six singers, with help from their covers as hard-working servants, that everyone should be captivated.The plot is slight: an older sister is to be married off to a wealthy count, who takes a shine to the younger, but she’s already secretly married. Cimarosa’s style has none of the richer jewels which stud the orchestral writing and character studies of Mozart’s comedies; nor does it approach the later hilarity of Rossini. Rather it occupies a likeable halfway house between the two (it was staged shortly after Mozart’s death, in February 1792, and the musically callow emperor seems to have liked it much more than anything by the master).Roy Laughlin kept the orchestra sympathetically on the move, and there were no longueurs in pace or plotting; quality librettist Bertati’s deft dramaturgy was spiced up in a brilliant translation by Donald Pippin. The singers looked splendid and convincing in Ellan Parry’s stylish 1920s costume designs; bright colours in the Mondrianish break up of the stage made effective use of limited production funds - David Howe worked wonders on the lighting for both productions - and in truth we needed no more. Least of all when every singer charmed. As the sisters, Alice Rose Privett sometimes sounded too bottled, Rosalind Coad too bright; but both are accomplished artists, respectively projecting the sweet and the bitchy to great effect, and rising to their big set-pieces in the second act. Scene-stealer, though, in terms of projecting the text and the humour was Heather Lowe as spinster aunt Fidelma (pictured above with Rosalind Coad and Frazer B Scott), a lovely characterization.The men filled their roles to perfection. Nick Pritchard is another of those English cathedral tenors with style to spare, though the top is a bit short. Frazer B Scott quickly settled into the bustle of officious father Geronimo, especially when brought up to the mark by the finest comic performance of the evening, Bradley Travis’s as a Woosterish Count Robinson (pictured centre with Privett and Pritchard), filling every moment with disciplined gesture: classic tours de force were the number in which he manages to play croquet, badminton and cricket while singing and a patter aria in which he tells Elisetta why he’ll make an unsuitable husband while at the same time succumbing to her sexual advances. In short, there was no flagging, and it seems a shame this first-class show only gets to run for three performances. All the singers should have a future, though – and I can just see Lowe and Travis as backbones of a new D'Oyly Carte company; may it happen soon.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/paul-bunyanthe-secret-marriage-british-youth-opera-peacock-theatre,4
490,"Anna Bolena, Welsh National Opera",Anna Bolena,Welsh National Opera,2013-09-08,stephen Walsh,"“Let the florid music praise,” sing Britten and Auden in their On This Island cycle; and I suppose we must do as we’re told, though aesthetic duty can be a hard taskmaster. For me it cracks its whip in the three Donizetti operas that, inexplicably, comprise almost the entire autumn repertoire of WNO, while other companies are, ironically enough, celebrating Britten’s centenary. The Welsh have just done, it’s true, an admirable Paul Bunyan, Britten’s first opera. Anna Bolena was not Donizetti’s first, but his thirtieth; and – though it has its moments – it still leaves me hoping nobody revives the previous 29, to say nothing of most of the 35 that followed, only two of which, mercifully, are in the Cardiff schedule.Last autumn, WNO celebrated Free Spirits (Lulu, the Vixen, and – debatably – Butterfly); this autumn it’s dead Tudor queens and their victims. “Heads will roll,” thunders the publicity, with Donizetti's Maria Stuarda and Roberto Devereux on the horizon. But in fact his Anne Boleyn doesn’t lose her head, only her mind, before collapsing or, in Alessandro Talevi’s Cardiff production, retreating upstage pursued in orderly fashion by the rest of the cast.Needless to say, this is by no means the librettist, Felice Romani’s only re-reading of history. Talevi makes a worthy attempt to politicize Anne’s downfall by showing her in childbirth at curtain-up and nursing the poor little scrap (the unwanted future Queen Elizabeth) in her delirium towards the end. But the child is scarcely mentioned in the opera, which represents Henry’s motive for dispatching his second wife as exclusively sexual, while all the other characters are driven to their deaths by an improbable mixture of disinterested love and unblemished honour. The result is psychologically bland, though with outbursts of conflict that of course prompt the best music. But for much of the time the score bounces along quite merrily, in major keys, square phrases and neat cadences, as if blighted passion and brutal death were like Test Match Special interrupted by the shipping forecast.Well, this isn’t criticism but, clearly, a mental block of mine. So enough of it. Musically the WNO production – played on Saturday to a far from full house – seems to me excellent. But for many reasons, not all of which would it be kind to detail, it’s often better enjoyed with the eyes shut. Serena Farnocchia is vocally brilliant as Anna, particularly touching in her mad scene (including Donizetti’s exquisite take on “Home, Sweet Home”), but also superb in her duet with Jane Seymour, the opera’s one indubitably great scene, and the only one that seriously dissects the moral confusion of its dramatis personae.Katharine Goeldner’s Jane (pictured right, by Robert Workman) is vocally less serene, more varied and arguably richer in colouring. The two voices make an incredibly interesting pair, playing off well one against the other, or floating in parallel. But they are not an easy duo to watch, partly because Madeleine Boyd has dressed them unbecomingly in short black skirts that, to be frank, suit neither their figures nor their movement. It is, by the way, an almost entirely black and white production, the chorus women clad much like the soloists, and the men in black tunics, like some Ruritanian Gestapo, in neutral, dark, boxed interiors.Alastair Miles’s Henry VIII is far from the historical image, but on the slender side, long of hair and black of voice, sinisterly authoritative, a well-conceived portrait. His second act trio with Farnocchia and Robert McPherson as Anne’s erstwhile fiancé, Henry Percy, is another high point in a work whose best episodes nearly all come in the long second half. McPherson lacks the con forza element that the high tenor writing seems to need, but sings it with a certain effortless charm that suits the character – more or less a Romane invention - in a naïve kind of way.  Daniel Grice makes as much as possible of Anne’s implausible brother, Rochefort, who goes to the block with Percy purely out of good fellowship. Robyn Lyn Evans strides on and off impressively as the king’s security supremo, Lord Hervey.Daniele Rustioni conducts with suitable gusto, reminding us that Donizetti’s talents included a precise if uncomplicated ear for orchestral sonority. This is no mean consolation in what, for me, is a very long evening.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/anna-bolena-welsh-national-opera,3
491,"Prom 72: Calleja, Orchestra Sinfonica di Milano Giuseppe Verdi, Zhang",Prom 72: Calleja,Orchestra Sinfonica di Milano Giuseppe Verdi,2013-09-06,Edward Seckerson,"It was too little too late to redress the scant attention gives to Verdi’s bicentenary at this year’s Proms but the “Maltese Tenor” – Joseph Calleja – arrived with an eleventh hour offering of low-key Verdi arias and joining him was the Milanese orchestra bearing the composer’s name. Calleja’s growing legions of fans were much in evidence, of course, more Maltese than Italian flags, but what can they have made of the music stand which came between them and their hero? Five arias, one of which he will have sung a zillion times, and still – despite the presence of TV cameras – the music was laid out on the stand for security?Admittedly Attila and Les vepres Siciliennes are hardly common fare and one should applaud him for not only reaching for the operatic pop classics – but all were short and easily learned and none made the kind of demands that all of us were there to thrill to. Indeed Calleja (pictured below) broke more of a sweat walking on and off between arias (why?) than he did singing them. The voice, as we know well, is gorgeous – a distinctive timbre, dusky in colour with that engaging flutter in the vibrato and warmth and girth throughout its compass; but all those stylistic nuances we have come to know and love were little in evidence.“O dolore!” from Attila was short and sweet, “À toi que j’ai chérie” from Les vepres siciliennes was suave and understated in the French manner; the apparent betrayal of Rodolfo from Luisa Miller was worn lightly, and even Gabriel Adorno’s despair (Simon Boccanegra) was somehow disengaged emotionally, diminished by being heard out of context with even the big surprise of the gently ebbing cabaletta (or what would technically be the cabaletta) sounding somehow too pat – correct rather than involving as singing.The fact is that Calleja had chosen to give himself an easy outing and there was nothing here to stretch him emotionally or technically – except perhaps the pay-off top B of “La donna è mobile” and even that short-changed us with an early cut-off. If you can’t flaunt your technique in an exhibition such as this then when can you? No encore, despite the adoring fans begging for more. They were clearly hoping for something exciting to take home. No such luck. Back to the CDs.The Orchestra Sinfonica di Milano Giuseppe Verdi had begun the evening on home turf with a spirited Overture to La forza del destino under their diminutive dynamo of a conductor, Xian Zhang (pictured below). The rivalry between Don Carlo and Don Alvaro was tensely chronicled, premonitions of their final duet heard in unison oboe, flute and clarinet, Leonora’s prayer evolving from fragile violins to a sizzling tremolando-driven declamation. This was a drama they had plainly revisited many times – the smell of the theatre was in every bar.So would they make something operatic of the concluding instalment of this year’s Tchaikovsky symphonies cycle – Manfred? Well, the Manfred theme surged through the lower register of every string player briefly lending a touch of Tchaikovskian amplitude to a section otherwise well short of the requisite depth of tone. But in the main this was a pretty shabby showing from an orchestra doing far from what comes naturally. The way this music moves and sings felt as alien as it probably was; too much was tentative and half-baked and despite the vigorous efforts of Zhang to keep things together nothing could disguise the insecurity of it all, the countless instances of ragged ensemble – and one dramatic slippage in the finale. The Alpine fairy of the second movement was apparently wearing clogs – only the final page achieved a fleeting iridescence. And could Zhang not hear how ponderous and prosaic, enervating, her tempo for the pastoral third movement sounded?For the second time this week – the other being the Oslo Philharmonic on Monday – an orchestra has brought an indifferent tam-tam to the party. At least there were no untoward organ bloopers. In fact the organ was just about all that was blooper-free.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/prom-72-calleja-orchestra-sinfonica-di-milano-giuseppe-verdi-zhang,2
492,"Prom 60: Billy Budd, Glyndebourne Festival Opera, Davis",Prom 60: Billy Budd,Glyndebourne Festival Opera,2013-08-28,David Nice,"You may well ask whether theartsdesk hasn’t already exhausted all there is to say about Glyndebourne’s most celebrated Britten production of recent years. I gave it a more cautious welcome than most on its first airing, troubled a little by the literalism of Michael Grandage’s production and the defects in all three principal roles. Alexandra Coghlan was more enthusiastic about this season’s revival but found one crucial shortcoming in Mark Padmore as Captain Vere, the god of the floating kingdom suffering a mortal blow when his repressed resident villain the Master at Arms John Claggart is struck dead by “good” handsome sailor Bllly Budd. Would the Albert Hall shift perspectives?It did, and in the usual unexpected ways. Padmore, possessing the smallest of the three lead voices, projected best right to the back of the hall, where I was this time sitting, with crystal clear inflection and articulation of every phrase, making the most intimate moments the most telling. By which I mean the Prologue, in which Vere looks back on 1797 and his ship the HMS Indomitable’s role in the Napoleonic Wars, and the Epilogue, where he sees Billy’s sacrifice as his own personal – sexual, imply the librettist of the Melville story E M Forster and Britten – liberation. The big final major-key triad, heart-stopping from the London Philharmonic under Sir Andrew Davis, and its fade to nothing, the voice left alone and Padmore walking off to total silence, were as stunning a couple of moments as any in this year’s Proms operas.If only what went before had been consistently up to that level. The big disappointment, in this venue at least, was Brindley Sherratt’s Claggart (pictured with Jacques Imbrailo's Billy to the left of the picture). No suggestion here of Forster’s “sexuality gone soggy”, and though Sherratt has always been a true bass, there was none of the inky-black resonances that had so cut through the Albert Hall murk in Eric Halfvarson’s and Stephen Milling's Ring giants and even the now-controversial Wagner performance of Sir John Tomlinson, the greatest of all Claggarts. Maybe Sherratt is more cut out to be a noble sort, as his peerless Pimen, Sarastro and Pogner have already proved.The object of Claggart's self-thwarted desire was, as in 2010, the Billy of Jacques Imbrailo: a likeable chap with a lightish baritone, sweet but not even innocently sexy or especially charismatic. Waiting in the wings as it were was a singer with a bigger voice and presence, Duncan Rock, who along with Peter Gijsbertsen (both pictured left), made the soulful sax-dominated scene of the aftermath to the Novice’s flogging a strong one (Rock will be singing Tarquinius in Fiona Shaw’s hugely anticipated Glyndebourne Touring Opera production of The Rape of Lucretia).The rest of the ensemble and the Glyndebourne Chorus were as strong as ever, making the best in the hall of the “moment we’ve been waiting for” in Act Two before mists obscure the enemy. I wavered about the wisdom of having Ian Rutherford’s re-staging done in costume; the evening dress of Justin Way’s Wagner operas had seemed more liberating. But the realism of the one-to-ones certainly worked. Again, the more intimate scenes in Vere’s cabin, with the back projection working especially well, came across the most vividly – though Padmore is still taxed to express extreme anguish: you expect the searing of a Langridge, whose voice Padmore’s so often resembles, or a Pears, but it falls just a little short. Davis (pictured right) cut through the cotton wool of the Albert Hall to give incision at every turn of Britten's finely calibrated orchestral screw, with magnificent focus in all departments from scything LPO brass down to Debussyan flute and harp reflections, while never quite billowing in all but the last of the big moments. So fine an achievement in many ways, so clearly the fruit of long-term teamwork, but it could have been so much more devastating.

493,"Prom 57: Parsifal, Hallé, Elder",Prom 57: Parsifal,Hallé,2013-08-26,David Nice,"So for one last time this season the impossible colosseum of Albertopolis became the Wagnerian holiest of holies – to be precise, the Cathedral of the Holy Grail - and once again I fell in love with the beast transfigured. Justin Way, the one artist common to all seven Wagner operas as their subtle semi-stager, should be the delegate to receive the award the Proms deserve for highest achievement of bicentenary year; and it seemed right to have Sir John Tomlinson, albeit by dint of another bass’s indisposition, giving his benediction as the witness of a final miracle.No mere ghost of Wagnerian excellence past, this Gurnemanz; you always fear imminent heart-attack under pressure, but that’s been the case for years now, so pray for his continuing health as a long-life bass (they’re the lucky ones in terms of longevity). By the third act even this titan was flagging; but the pressure of emotion continued to carry it through. One of the pleasures for me of the Proms Wagner performances I count myself hugely privileged to have witnessed has been to discard the printed libretto-translation – still no supertitles for the Royal Albert Hall – and see how much meaning comes across. And with Tomlinson, it was effortlessly projected with physical ease and powerful gestures; vital since Gurnemanz is the chronicler of the brotherhood of the grail’s decline and its search for salvation in the shape of the pure fool made wise through compassion.No-one was going to believe, outwardly at least, in Wagnerian veteran Lars Cleveman's Parsifal as a confused stripling, but he too left us in no doubt of a soul in search of enlightenment. The tenor voice is light-ish, like Robert Dean Smith’s in the Proms Tannhäuser and Tristan, but Cleveman is capable like Smith of staying the course and pulling out the stops, if not the darker colours ideally needed for Parsifal’s Act Three transformation as a knight of endless suffering.Total assumption of the evening, though, was Katarina Dalayman’s as Kundry the undead (where was she last Thursday when we needed an idiomatic Wagnerian soprano for the  Wesendonck Lieder?) Refusing to abet Wagner’s ridiculous scenario, as in Tannhäuser, of sanctity equals good, sensuousness bad, she settled neither for pure penitence on the one hand and evil voluptuousness on the other but served up a woman of infinite variety. Way’s staging allowed us to chart her few-notes presence in Act One and her even more silent role in Act Three (Kundry, having been through the vampy mill once more as magician Klingsor’s seductress, returns to deracinated Montsalvat to see and understand; she sings only two words, or rather one repeated: “dienen, dienen” – “to serve”). How deeply moving this was, the Magdalene at Parsifal’s feet, the despairing Gurnemanz hardly able to believe his eyes, Cleveman’s stricken wanderer absolutely still between them.Vocally, Dalayman was perfect. Mezzo, even contralto, chest voice connected to the rest; the middle range is pure Wagnerian-soprano gold and the top was fearless, and fierce in her Act Two desperation, where she changed before our eyes from poised diva in shimmering evening wear to a soul in hell.But no Parsifal is going to succeed merely through individual performances; its religious ritual must convince. Sir Mark Elder’s control of the light within his excellent Hallé Orchestra and the absolute synchonicity of onstage knights – the Royal Opera Chorus, swelling to spine-tingling, tear-jerking effect – with “youths” above in gallery east and boys to the north (Trinity Boys’ Choir and Hallé Youth Choir, absolutely superlative) made the grail ceremonies more elevating than any I’ve previously heard. I have no issue with Elder being slower than most when Wagner simply writes “sehr Langsam”, but I do wish he’d sometimes be a bit more impetuously dramatic in the action-rushes. The model of Sir Reginald Goodall he so admires is fine for symphonic cohesion, but not always for music-theatre.Still, the malevolent prelude to Klingsor’s magic garden, soon abetted by Tom Fox’s impassively evil magician, suitably surged, and the agony of the incurable wound Amfortas received there had suitable intensity in the acting, if not entirely the lightish and not exactly distinctive baritone voice, of Detlef Roth, a later replacement than Tomlinson. His enactment of the grail ritual, arms held aloft (qi gong training?), very much helped us to believe in its supernatural quality.Among the squires, Joshua Ellicott projected a bigger tenor voice than his light-lyric repertoire to date might suggest – a Heldentenor in the making? – and the Flower Maidens who toy with Parsifal in the magic garden (pictured right with Cleveman) were playful though hardly sensual, abetted by floral luminescence on the ever-useful back screen.Did I believe in the final tableau, “Our Redeemer redeemed”? Not entirely – Wagner always seems happier in a state of irresolution rather than apotheosis, and the music tells us nothing more than it did in Act One – but the inwardness of the orchestral playing went as far towards conveying the metaphysical as we’re likely to get. Besides, it was the only possible conclusion to a magnificent Wagner sequence at the Proms which will remain among the lifelong highlights of anyone lucky enough to catch all, or some, of it live.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/prom-57-parsifal-hall%C3%A9-elder,4
494,"Paul Bunyan, Welsh National Youth Opera, Cardiff",Paul Bunyan,Welsh National Youth Opera,2013-08-24,stephen Walsh,"Reading through WH Auden’s libretto for Britten’s first stage work – the so-called operetta Paul Bunyan – it’s sometimes hard to decide whether the intention was to participate in the great American dream or to make fun of it. In 1941 both artists were living in the United States and writing for Americans, who famously didn’t take to the work’s blend of folksy condescension and sententious eloquence. The combination is still faintly queasy. Towards the end, a Disneyesque dog and two cats pray for deliverance “from a homespun humour manufactured in the city”, and the mind inevitably strays back over the previous two hours’ entertainment.Entertaining the piece nevertheless is, if patchily, with longueurs, and music that veers between the brilliantly witty and individual, with echoes and pre-echoes of more familiar Britten, and a kind of routine pastiche, part baroque, part ballad, part hillbilly. We are in forest America at the start of time, and Paul Bunyan, the giant embodiment of the pioneering spirit, is gathering together his team of primal lumberjacks, including a quartet of blond, straw-haired Swedes, a pair of lousy fat cooks, and a chorus of assorted frontiersmen and women. Camp life is punctuated by comic vignettes, a fight or two, an argument over the bad food, a bereavement, and a love affair between the good cook Slim and Bunyan’s daughter Tiny, all done as set pieces in vaudeville style, and bound together by Auden’s dazzling brand of sophisticated, tongue-in-cheek doggerel (“Here lies Hel Helson from Scandinavia/Rather regretting his rash behaviour”).Gradually the America we know and love emerges, the America of John Wayne and the man who shot Liberty Valance, of Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan: not quite “a man’s gotta do what a man’s gotta do”, but very nearly that, in Bunyan’s closing “America is what you do… what you choose to make it.” In this WNO Youth Opera staging by Martin Constantine and designer Cai Dyfan, there’s something vaguely off-putting about the incessant back-projection of Stephen Fry’s teeth in close-up as he delivers Bunyan’s spoken lines, pre-recorded, beautifully, but in a style not far off that of a Cinerama-Holiday voiceover. Whether or not Dyfan’s other back-projections – of jagged Rocky Mountains – are making some point about the archetypal landscape of Bunyan’s vast dentures is not wholly clear; but if so, it’s an idea that matches the homespun humour of the rest of the work.Too much Fry then (in his actual absence), but otherwise a sparkling production, brilliantly stage-managed, and delivered with obvious enjoyment and immense vitality by these young singers in the wide open spaces of the Wales Millennium Centre. Constantine resists imposing any heavy concept – whether lofty or parodistic – on the simple tale. Not too intrusive is the boy American, vintage 1941, who watches the show in bed on a proscenium-wide TV set with unsteady vertical hold while being occasionally petted by the cast. Is this telling us the piece is dated, or merely of its time, when the USA was still almost the one safe, civilised place on the planet? At the very end, “where the dream becomes the fact”, as Bunyan puts it, a few men with guns roam the stage – an ironic image that needs no emphasis, and isn’t emphasised.It seems invidious to single out individuals from a big and almost uniformly excellent cast, but two or three stand out, if only because they get the best music. Vanessa Bowers (pictured right with Ross Scanlon) delivers Tiny’s touching lament for her dead mother exquisitely, Elgan Llyr Thomas is highly convincing as Jonny Inkslinger, the camp intellectual, and Joseph Gorvett is irresistible in the bike-on role of the Western Union Boy with his life-changing telegrams, delivered in a kind of fractured Al Bowlly style. The chorus singing is exemplary throughout, and Alice Farnham conducts, stylishly, with fine playing from an unnamed orchestra.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/paul-bunyan-welsh-national-youth-opera-cardiff,4
495,"Prom 45: The Midsummer Marriage, BBC Symphony Orchestra, Davis",Prom 45: The Midsummer Marriage,BBC Symphony Orchestra,2013-08-17,Geoff Brown,"Jeremy Paxman’s beard may have been a wonder and a talking point for five days, but Michael Tippett’s opera The Midsummer Marriage beats it by almost 60 years. Ecstatic, visionary, energetic music, yes indeed. But, oh, the composer’s libretto! The Magic Flute, T. S. Eliot’s The Waste Land, English folk lore, Greek myths, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Carl Jung’s archetypes of the unconscious mind, wafts of wisdom from the East: all get crammed and overheated in the pot, cooked by someone with a soaring lyrical musical gift but only a talent for awkward verbiage when it comes to writing words. You try singing the phrase “sibylline misgivings”. It’s also a damned awkward piece to stage. Covent Garden’s original production in 1955 placed the story of the midsummer travails of the marriage-bound Mark and Jenifer in settings by sculptor Barbara Hepworth, described in the Times as like “Stonehenge reconditioned for the Festival of Britain”. The Proms, almost as courageously, attempted a semi-staging, but apart from the singers’ vivid costumes, ranging from sibylline clobber to lumberjack shirt, Kenneth Richardson’s stage direction chiefly underlined the absurdities of pushing characters through heaven, hell, and much vaguer places inside the Albert Hall’s Victorian pomp.Formally attired, slow of gait on the auditorium steps, David Soar and Madeleine Shaw’s He-Ancient and She-Ancient looked for all the world like BAFTA presenters arriving onstage to present an award. Only Catherine Wyn-Jones, as soothsaying Madame Sosostris, really created a dramatic stir, first singing unseen from the gallery, then flinging arms wide by the distant organ. Luckily, no attempt was made to simulate the hero and heroine’s clinching copulation session while enveloped in lotus petals. But the music, the music! That’s what keeps this opera intoxicating, right from the opening’s wonderful punchy chords and scurrying strings, which establishes an energy level that dips occasionally but always zooms back. For Sir Andrew Davis, Friday’s Prom slotted into a week mostly devoted to conducting Britten’s Billy Budd at Glyndebourne (itself due for a Prom semi-staging on August 27). Two different worlds, there; but Davis’s mastery and devoted love of Tippett’s ecstatic counterpoint, lyrical surges and kaleidscopic colours came through loud and clear. So did the BBC Symphony Orchestra, whether the sound was heraldic red (the gorgeous brass section), heavenly blue (radiant violins), eerie silver (the magic celesta) or a dappled, numinous tapestry binding all worlds into one.And the singing? A few up and downs, not least in audibility and the difficult matter of balance in the Hall’s giant soup tureen. As Mark, the casually dressed bridegroom, tenor Paul Groves ideally needed rounder tones and a smoother flow to match Tippett’s florid flights of melody, almost neo-baroque. Erin Wall’s bride Jenifer (nondescript blue jacket) began muted and indistinct, but bumped up the volume and glow once she emerged supernaturally transfigured in the Act One finale. Tippett’s libretto treats the love couple from the lower orders, secretary Bella and mechanic Jack, in a more user-friendly way. They have plainer words, bigger shafts of character. Ailish Tynan’s vocal gusto as Bella almost matched her bright secretary dresses, though feminists couldn’t be pleased by the character’s willingness to stay at home after marriage, cooking, washing clothes and bringing up baby. Meanwhile, Allan Clayton’s easy delivery entirely suited someone with hands slipped into the pockets of jeans and the hearty working man’s check shirt: another character locked into stereotypes one might have hoped the libertarian and former Trotskyist composer would have ditched.A late arrival in the cast, David Wilson-Johnson was an asset too as the puffed-up businessman King Fisher, forceful in voice and gesture, though not when navigating Richardson’s toughest assignment – reaching Sosostris’s organ perch by pushing perilously right in front of the singing chorus. Not that the disruption, or anything else, stopped the flow from the BBC Singers and BBC Symphony Chorus, on top form throughout. As for Catherine Wyn-Rogers’ Sosostris, she looked, alas, better than she sounded: her great Act 3 aria, stately and luscious, needed more volume, more authority. Perhaps she should have been given a loudhailer. Still, bumps and all, everyone got to the end, the opera’s follies clear enough, but with its energy and ecstatic zing even clearer. “A magnificent evocation of post-war renewal,” Oliver Soden wrote in his programme note. Exactly so, even with those sibylline misgivings.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/prom-45-midsummer-marriage-bbc-symphony-orchestra-davis,3
496,"Fidelio, Opéra de Lyon, Festival Theatre, Edinburgh",Fidelio,Opéra de Lyon,2013-08-13,Roderic Dunnett,"When first seen at Serge Dorny’s Opéra de Lyon in March-April this year, American Gary Hill’s unusual vision of Beethoven’s Fidelio could be recognised immediately as concept opera: drama where a director’s “idea” largely takes over the story. Hill directs (up to a point), and conceived the mesmerising projections that dominated the stage (realised, with jaw-dropping skill, by his technical assistant).Two ideas, culled from fragments of Beethoven’s ponderously-evolved libretto, dominate this production, revived at Edinburgh’s Festival Theatre. First, that events take place on a futuristic spaceship – hence the ridiculous, inconsistent costumes that risk turning Leonora and Pizarro into ludicrous ciphers, and with it the myriad, semi-relevant circling star signs. Secondly, that the idea of “liberty”, so perfectly expressed even in this variable original libretto, has to be hammered home ad nauseam. This is handled both aptly (by some pontificating use of Beethoven’s own diaries), and less so by numerous concocted references to starry hocus-pocus, inserted in the spoken and sometimes sung passages by Hill.The truth is, we need Beethoven and we arguably don’t need Gary Hill. There were pluses. I too was mesmerised by the front curtain projections (white on black apart from a wonderful floral outburst which greets the very good Prisoners’ Chorus – nominally evacuated, but now repressed by this director). One was in awe of the technology: tear-jerking stick-man prisoners in hunched postures above the recumbent Florestan (a vocally satisfying Nikolai Schukoff, awakening in a time and space tunnel, above), and felt wonderment at the ultimately benevolent universe that Hill insistently evoked. The idea was not duff, or even overdone. It was consistent; one was beguiled like a small child playing with a kaleidoscope. But most of this was at the expense of the characters. They were curtain-bound, and you couldn’t always hear them perfectly. Christoph Baumgärtel’s businesslike Jaquino, the fabulous Moldovan soprano and 2011 Cardiff Singer of the World competition winner Valentina Naforniţă, and superb bass-baritone Pavlo Hunka, an acclaimed Falstaff and Wozzeck and an ENO regular: all were unduly muted and looked frankly ridiculous. Leonora’s outfit made Swedish-born Erika Sunnegårdh look silly and fat, while her shivering late intervention was fluffed not by her, but by the direction.Riding around the stage on naff wheels didn’t help, but the glorious Viennese Michael Eder as Rocco rode above all to give the best performance – lucid, commanding, sympathetic, rich right across the range. Eder (pictured centre above, with Erika Sunnegårdh) recently starred in concert as an oppressor in Karl Amadeus Hartmann’s Simplicius Simplicissimus, an opera on tyranny akin to Fidelio and as good, yet ludicrously neglected by major houses.    Shenanigans apart, the one person who did guarantee a superb Fidelio was Opéra de Lyon’s music director, conductor Kazushi Ono, who brought such intelligence, precision and empathy with text and music that his integrity nearly blew all Hill’s fripperies away. You felt Ono’s strength in Florestan’s revival, the impact of Leonora’s big aria, and the redeeming arrival of Don Fernando (Andrew Schroeder, who eclipsed Hunka’s diminished Pizarro even more than the pathetic, billowing quasi-Japanese costume did).Hill’s wheeze was to run two ideas together in counterpoint, a meeting of Napoleonic 1814 and future constellations. Happily we still got the 1814 bit. Quite what the rest of it was about, heaven knows.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/fidelio-op%C3%A9ra-de-lyon-festival-theatre-edinburgh,3
497,"Billy Budd, Glyndebourne Festival Opera",Billy Budd,Glyndebourne Festival Opera,2013-08-11,alexandra Coghlan,"It’s not a crowd-pleaser like Albert Herring, nor wittily fanciful like A Midsummer Night’s Dream or macabre like The Turn of the Screw and certainly not the classic that Peter Grimes has become, and until three years ago Glyndebourne had never even staged Britten’s Billy Budd. But Michael Grandage’s 2010 production was a sea-changer. Aided by Mark Elder in the pit, the director made his operatic debut with devastating simplicity, reminding us all of the power of this uneasy tragedy. This anniversary year the production returns, and though there are some significant changes among the crew of the Indomitable, the drama cuts more keenly than ever.Embraced in the wooden hull of Glyndebourne’s intimate opera house it’s unnerving to find yourself staring into just such another on stage. Christopher Oram’s set invites the audience below decks into a claustrophobic cross-section of a British Man of War, trapping us inside this giant wooden rib-cage. We’re not even permitted a glimpse out onto deck and beyond for Billy’s hanging. The sea is a striking omission here, but then this is not an opera about the sea as Peter Grimes is; it’s an opera about men, whose evils and ideologies create the real landscapes that so fascinate the composer here.This is above all an ensemble piece. Britten’s orchestral writing – always so vivid – is rarely out of the foreground here as wind squalls bluster through the rigging and low brass mists loom over the water. The all-male chorus too are rarely absent from stage, their collective rhythms and rituals not just framing but fashioning the tragedy. Glyndebourne’s company is made for this kind of theatre, and though Andrew Davis can’t quite muster the same rhetorical clarity from the London Philharmonic Orchestra that Elder achieved, the singers bring their all – a physical force, when the whole chorus comes together, to equal Britten’s stormiest orchestral moments.While the original Billy (Jacques Imbrailo, pictured right) returns, his gleeful energy radiating out among the dull greys and browns of the sailors, and bringing a vocal sophistication to match his dramatic innocence, there are big changes elsewhere. Mark Padmore (pictured below with Imbrailo) appears in his first major operatic role in the UK as Captain Vere. For a tenor so often associated with Britten’s music in the concert hall it shouldn’t be such a stretch, but Padmore’s is not a voice that has grown at the same pace as – say – Ian Bostridge’s, and there was a real question as to whether he would find the vocal space and power for the fury and passion of the latter sections of the opera. In the event he doesn’t quite, but his not-quite-success makes for a curiously plausible Vere – bookish and other-worldly against the hulking trio of Redburn (Stephen Gadd, voice aglow almost as much as his ruddy whiskers), Flint (David Soar) and Ratcliffe (Darren Jeffery).There’s no doubting the sinister force of Brindley Sherratt’s Claggart however, whose menacing physicality is offset by the beauty of his tone. His villain is all the more potent for his musical appeal, incongruous to magnificent effect in a moment such as his “Let him crawl,” of the recently-beaten Novice who cannot walk.Elsewhere Peter Gijsbertsen’s Maintop is promoted to an excellent Novice, while Duncan Rock gives us a taste of what to expect from his Tarquinius in the forthcoming Glyndebourne The Rape of Lucretia as Novice’s Friend. Jeremy White’s Dansker is unusually gentle, and enormously touching in his final dealings with the condemned Billy.Grandage’s operatic debut succeeds where so many fail by trusting the work he has chosen. Britten’s drama is so inherent in his music, itself so organic an extension of Forster and Crozier’s libretto, that it needs nothing else to work. You don’t even need to add water, as Glyndebourne have so elegantly proved here. This is production without revisionist agenda and without pretensions, a perfect piece of musical storytelling. It should be mandatory viewing for lovers and haters of opera alike.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/billy-budd-glyndebourne-festival-opera-0,4
498,"Prom 29: Tannhäuser, BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, Runnicles",Prom 29: Tannhäuser,BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra,2013-08-05,David Nice,"On the one occasion I went to Bayreuth, I made the mistake of seeing The Flying Dutchman and Lohengrin after the best of Ring cycles. At the Proms we’ve had a week of serious Wagnerian withdrawal symptoms, so Tannhäuser was never going to feel like too much or too little of a good thing. In any case, this always fascinating if dramatically primitive early clash of sex and religion is shot through with later passages composed in between work on the Ring, most of them included in last night's 1875 hybrid version. And Donald Runnicles is not a conductor to stand in the shadow of Daniel Barenboim.Heretical it might be to say so, but in many ways Runnicles seems to me a more authentic interpreter of late romantic music. His well drilled BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra may not be encouraged to spotlight anything like as many hallucinogenic details as Barenboim’s Berlin Staatskapelle did last week - and of course there are fewer in Tannhäuser - but the flow is more organic, the rubato more natural. Every effect has still been carefully thought through. Runnicles' strings are lightweight in comparison to Barenboim's but projected every line with infallible articulation. The horns at the start of the overture made just as much of an impression as Barenboim's at the bottom of the Rhine and the sonorities of offstage or upstage brass were every inch as trenchant as the ones we thought so unsurpassable from the Berliners.In many respects, it was business as usual. I hope we’ve all come to admire just how much vividness the Proms’ resident Wagner-in-concert director Justin Way brings to bear on singers relating to one another without scores. This time he was perhaps saddled with performers of less even dramatic abilities, but all eventually rose to the challenge. That was especially true of Robert Dean Smith (pictured above), making his second visit to the Proms this season. His essential qualities can easily be missed in the rush to demand a Wagnerian tenor who sacrifices himself on the altar of high intensity. This is a lyric voice pushed to its outer limits, but he can do the job.As the minstrel torn between sexy Venus and holy Elisabeth, he husbands his resources but always makes sense of line and text. Having wished for more from him in his bid to quit the Venusberg – surely it was telling that this Tannhäuser kept his jacket on in the pagan bordello – we got it in the crucial and insanely long Act Three narrative of the pilgrim’s journey to Rome and his crushing rejection by an unholy Pope. Tenors who might have laid all on the line earlier would be wilting by this stage; not Dean Smith. We’re luckier to have him than many people realize.Even so, there were no prizes for guessing the star voices of the evening: first, and uniquely, the stupendous new bass on the block, Estonian Ain Anger, easy of phrase and charismatic of manner in what is surely Wagner’s dullest role for that voice. But you’d happily listen to this Thuringian Landgrave read out the guest-list for his Wartburg song competition. Mezzo Daniela Sindram (pictured above) burnt up the stage with her urgently pleading love goddess: looking suitably dominatrixy in a fetching bodice, striking of feature and secure in every note from cutting chest voice to incandescent top. I can’t wait to see her Octavian in Der Rosenkavalier.Equal first with these two were the infinitely adaptable men and women from the ""Concert Association"" of the Deutsche Oper Berlin, where Runnicles is Music Director. And what a role, or roles, they have to play. Quality voices were apparent from the start as siren sounds billowed down from the gallery; the two pilgrim choruses rose from silky pianissimos to focused thunder. And Runnicles was immensely helpful in keeping the infallibly tuneful Entry of the Guests in Act Two on the move. Here in the Wartburg, cleverly paralleled with the Albertine colosseum as the hall's motifs flashed up on the ever-helpful strip at the back, we met Heidi Melton’s Elisabeth (pictured below with Anger's Landgrave). Luminous with the upper-register big guns and a sympathetic actress – as the Act Three dumb show of her wait for Tannhäuser's return from Rome subtly stressed – Melton has one flaw, a slightly too fast vibrato to keep the flame of the saintly lady’s slower music steady.In that she was a match for Christoph Pohl’s trusty Wolfram, an unusual voice with dignity to spare in the justly famous aria to the evening star (though Christian Gerhaher’s Royal Opera performance is hard to shift in the mind for those of us lucky enough to have seen it). The blokes who come in from their hunt to find Tannhäuser newly returned to earth looked like an identity line up of bouncers. Four of the six seemed to know exactly what was going on, and two didn’t, but all sounded great in ensemble.Just one other dress quibble: Hila Fahima, a vision in red, looked like another Venus rather than a humble shepherd boy (it should surely be possible to find a strong central European treble for the part, though she sang it with spirit). The spatial tricks of her/his pipe/cor anglais in counterpoint with those splendid antiphonal resounding horns, along with the subterranean Venusberg music in the final battle for Tannhäuser’s soul, once again showed that Wagner’s sense of stagecraft can become a thing of wonder in the Albert Hall. These Wagner performances have all made me fall in love again with this often infuriating venue’s possibilities, and it’s helped to have conductors like Barenboim and Runnicles who know exactly what to do with it.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/prom-29-tannh%C3%A4user-bbc-scottish-symphony-orchestra-runnicles,4
499,"Prom 20: Götterdämmerung, Staatskapelle Berlin, Barenboim",Prom 20: Götterdämmerung,Staatskapelle Berlin,2013-07-29,Edward Seckerson,"Even the Royal Albert Hall - the most problematic of venues - became a theatrical temple with stage director Justin Way underlining Wagner’s spatial effects so that Siegfried’s Rhine Journey and Hagen’s hunting horns could tantalise and surprise us with changes of direction. And there were just simple things like having Siegfried and Brünnhilde celebrate their union from the vantage point immediately in front of the organ console, where several hours later she will deliver the moving eulogy for her superhero.She, of course, was Nina Stemme, a singer and a voice of prodigious power and focus but, more importantly, warmth and evenness of production. In joy and in fury she was thrilling, and what a change to hear a Brünnhilde with a proper, as opposed to a pushed, top C. She crowned the dawn duet with an absolute stonker. ",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/prom-20-g%C3%B6tterd%C3%A4mmerung-staatskapelle-berlin-barenboim,5
500,"Prom 19: Tristan und Isolde, BBC Symphony Orchestra, Bychkov",Prom 19: Tristan und Isolde,BBC Symphony Orchestra,2013-07-28,Sebastian Scotney,"Such has been the justifiable flow of superlatives this week about the Berlin Staatskapelle's Ring conducted by Barenboim, the centrepiece of the BBC Proms' Wagner bicentenary celebration, it would have been easy to forget that the 2013 Proms season contains not just those four, but seven complete Wagner operas.Last night's performance of Tristan und Isolde was placed – respecting the chronological order in which Wagner composed them - between the Berliners' Siegfried on Friday and Götterdammerung on Sunday.Wagnerian completists in the audience can never get enough Wagner, especially around bicentenary time. The achievement of the promenaders who stood last night for five hours of Wagner is impressive - some of them will have been up at the rail for over 20 hours this week. However, the really long hours and the deeper involvement came from the performers. Conductor Semyon Bychkov had been granted 20 rehearsals prior to this performance of the Schott edition, complete and uncut, with the BBC Symphony orchestra, or a total of 60 hours.Bychkov, who has performed the opera in Paris, Chicago and Vienna, also brought his particularly strong and deep association with the piece (there is more on that topic, and the “monster” which he says Wagner created, in his interview with theartsdesk). This thoroughness in preparation - which London orchestras are allowed only rarely - reaped its rewards. Wagner specifically asks in the preface to the score for the solo cor anglais player to be outstanding, and for the strings to be “superbly good and strong”. Last night, both definitely were. Indeed, the performance which Bychkov coaxed from all sections of the BBC Symphony Orchestra was a fabulous display of versatility and sheer quality. And with the orchestra on stage, it also made them into a real, visible protagonist.When Wagner wrote his own libretto for Tristan, he pared down the story from the medieval poem, made it much more an internalised and psychological drama. He also removed just about all of Gottfried von Strassburg’s colourful wildlife. Confronted with Wagner, people who know and love the Gottfried poem miss the songbirds, the falcons, the Spanish horses, those wild boars frothing at the mouth. Put the orchestra on stage, and those beasts and their primitive instincts are somehow magically back.Continued OverleafThe finest moments last night mostly involved the Lithuanian soprano Violeta Urmana (pictured below). Wagner requires Isolde to stroke and caress one phrase, to snarl and hiss the next, to belt out another so that it hits the back wall of a huge theatre. Every flickering change in mood in her vocal part invokes a different adventure in orchestration. Those feverish string tremolandos, soaring wind figures, heaped-up horn calls brought vividness and reflected truth to Urmana's characterisation of Isolde.The role of Tristan makes huge demands on a Heldentenor. John Mitchinson reckoned it took him a week to recover every time he sang it. Jon Vickers talked about ""wrestling"" with it. From where I sat in the hall, Robert Dean Smith, an 11th-hour replacement for Peter Seiffert, appeared to be having a difficult night in the cavernous Royal Albert Hall, showing signs of vocal strain. He was sometimes overpowered by the orchestra and his vocal line got lost. It remains to be seen whether those impressions are reinforced or refuted when this performance is televised on 1 September.The audience definitely warmed to the Japanese mezzo soprano, Mihoko Fujimura, singing Brangaene, and to the Korean bass Kwanchul Youn (King Mark), and gave them huge applause at the end. I found Fujimura at her most convincing in an ethereal ""Einsam Wachend"" in Act 2, sung from the organ loft. I was less affected by her expressions of both agitation and warmth, but she is a fascinating singer, and clearly made her mark. Youn, similarly, was at his most effective when being conciliatory in Act 3. In his protestations of being betrayed in Act 2, his bass clarinet alter ego - the remarkable, full-toned Katherine Lacy - seemed to draw the attention away from him. As Kurwenal, Boaz Daniel was characterful, musical and strong. Smaller parts were well taken - notably by Andrew Staples as a beautifully lyrical Young Sailor and a tender Shepherd, and David Wilson-Johnson as a menacing Melot.Bychkov holds a conducting chair with the BBC Symphony named after the German maestro Günter Wand, who would have been 101 this year. Wand had bitter-sweet memories of Tristan which, late in life, he explained to his biographer Wolfgang Seifert: he had wanted to employ Salvador Dalí as the designer and Ingmar Bergman as the director for a production in Cologne in the 1960s. Wand believed in his plans, was convinced he could make them happen, and had felt let down by the response he got back from colleagues in Cologne: “They would all look at me all sympathetically, as if I'd completely snapped.”Last night's Tristan und Isolde conveyed, in the mind’s ear, both the psychological depth of Bergman and the surreal imagination of Dalí. Günter Wand would have smiled.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/prom-19-tristan-und-isolde-bbc-symphony-orchestra-bychkov-0,4
501,"Prom 18: Siegfried, Staatskapelle Berlin, Barenboim",Prom 18: Siegfried,Staatskapelle Berlin,2013-07-27,ismene Brown,"The transformative power of the Royal Albert Hall at Proms-time never ceases to amaze me. Here is Siegfried, the third in Wagner’s Ring cycle, sprawling in length, not over-strong in characters, yet in the Proms setting the rather over-extended character scenes cede to the extraordinary scene-painting, the noise of Mime’s metal-working, the inky mystery of Erda’s cavern, the bloody terrors of Fafner’s cave, the forest full of birdsong. Daniel Barenboim and the Staatskapelle Berlin made sure last night that five and a half hours very nearly sped by, so sumptuous and yet delicate was their dominance visually and aurally, and hence total absorption in this strange opera.The eye luxuriated in the banks of golden harps, the curiously squashed Wagner tubas, the stereo timpani far left and top right, the fleets of violas. In front of this ever-changing tapestry of musical motion, the singers were nicely marshalled in a semi-staged fashion by Justin Way, fielding divertingly tiny props - a miniature anvil, a little stick, a minute ring representing the grand symbols of insuperable might over which everyone squabbles in petty fashion.Yet what about the fire on Brünnhilde’s rock or the great dragon or the forging of Nothung? No problem, it all works excellently in Siegfried, as the absence of spectacular visual effects makes you concentrate on some of Wagner’s most ravishingly inventive orchestral writing. The Staatskapelle Berlin is an astounding band, and Barenboim can walk tightropes over chasms with them: he bonds the violins in almost inaudible pianissimi, he weighs out the volume from the brass in scruples, the dappling of some of the sound speaks of fervently detailed and united work.This part of the Ring saga has an awkwardness caused entirely by the oddness of the central character, the intended hero Siegfried. For much of the opera he’s the equivalent of a surly, spotty adolescent who feels neither fear nor conscience, and treats his adoptive father Mime with abominable rudeness.Yet we know that the hand-wringing Mime is an evil piece of work himself, intent on using the lad’s preternatural strength for his own ends, and the enormous attractiveness of Barenboim’s choice of performers (as actors as much as singers) was how comically sharp and realistic this relationship between Siegfried and Mime became.The two high tenor voices faced off, acidly bickering - the little, brilliantly fierce Peter Bronder and the tall, vibrantly natural Canadian heldentenor Lance Ryan (see main picture), who is outstandingly convincing in this almost unplayable role. Without costume, he can home in on things psychological, not visual. The ambivalence he feels for Mime - hatred, yet also an inability to leave him - is very persuasive of a relationship where each is abusing the other (left, Bronder's Mime at front, with Johannes Martin Kränzle's Alberich).Ryan’s voice is bright, high and clean; what it lacks in caramel edges it makes up for in how unaffectedly he produces it, almost conversationally, every word clear (he was a student of Carlo Bergonzi, a master of articulacy.) He persuaded absolutely of the callowness of Siegfried, and yet had the theatrical intelligence to show the lunkhead growing up very fast into dignity when finally making it to Brünnhilde’s rock, suddenly humbled by meeting this goddess, embarrassed by his own urgency.Nina Stemme (see main picture) commands adulthood in her man, though. Vocally she combines both mellow warmth of tone and the exciting attacks with accurate power where it counts; as an actress she homes in on Brünnhilde’s sense of extreme vulnerability at being woken by a stranger who has already half undressed her. I loved the tentative nuances both singers brought to the climactic love duet, which is a bit of a trudge to a prescribed point. It finishes Siegfried slightly unsatisfactorily (tonight’s and tomorrow’s Proms, Tristan und Isolde and Götterdämmerung, deliver the full emotional Monty).Yet the interest in this opera isn’t the required love story, it’s yet more of those skewed familial relationships that Wagner writes so brilliantly, both in text and music: the dwarf brothers Mime and Alberich, bitterly at war over the Ring; Wotan and Erda, estranged parents of Brünnhilde, meeting up reluctantly; and of course Wotan and Siegfried, the grandson whose uncomplicated strength must put right all the god’s complicated wrongs.Once again in this cycle the Wotan is different, this time in his Wanderer guise less a protagonist in the drama than an agent for Siegfried, which suited the casting of the veteran Norwegian baritone Terje Stensvold, beautifully autumnal in voice, dignified in demeanour. His scene with Erda had a pathos and heartfelt emotion not to be extracted from the younger lovers’ scene later, and he was much assisted by the terrific Anna Larsson (pictured right), tall and striking in a garnet fishtail dress, with a voice of veiled contralto depth. Barenboim and she held that scene in utter suspension, a most mysterious dream-place.Johannes Martin Kränzle’s Alberich was eclipsed in character terms by Bronder as his brother Mime, though indeed his part here is much smaller. Rinnat Moriah warbled her Woodbird exultantly from the highest reaches of the Albert Hall, and Eric Halfvarson roared Fafner from obscurity behind Sir Henry Wood’s head in the organ loft. A tumultuous audience ovation at the end left Barenboim looking pleased as punch, as well he should be. ",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/prom-18-siegfried-staatskapelle-berlin-barenboim,5
502,"Road Rage, Garsington Opera",Road Rage,Garsington Opera,2013-07-25,Roderic Dunnett,"Garsington Opera, now based at John Paul Getty’s countrified home, the Wormsley Estate near Henley, has nipped a leaf out of Glyndebourne’s book and embarked on its first full-blooded Community Opera: a far cry from Vivaldi and Rossini, but not from Janáček (Garsington will stage The Cunning Little Vixen next season). Road Rage has a shiveringly well-turned, witty, singable text by Sir Richard Stilgoe, and a score by Orlando Gough, who was behind Glyndebourne’s big hit Imago.Featuring a ""green"" script that suggests Rome drove its famous viae stratae through helpless peasant smallholdings (cue centurions, slaves, surveyors), it then unfolds an amusing modern parallel as a crazed Government Minister (tenor Daniel Norman in his most bizarre mode: blogging, tweeting and cosying-up to Paxman) attempts to push a motorway through a sleepy Chiltern backwater.By stages, Road Rage evolves into a ""demo"" opera, protesters of every kind unleashing the show’s upward fizzing energy. Gough’s music, given a lift by members of Simon Over’s Southbank Sinfonia, is akin to the genres he explored at Glyndebourne, but perhaps more relaxed, and at times positively rural and ultimately hymnic. Gough shines best with catchy syncopation, and when Norman’s verbose, incompetent, Jim Hacker-style Minister is briefed by his sinister, smart-ass acolytes, Road Rage acquires a modern musical punch one could almost dub Mozartian.The fact these sly, know-all advisors are teenagers, and musically very competent ones – these suave youngsters were easily the show’s best singers and characters - renders them as bolshie as the protestors they are confronting. There are three more ""professional"" roles: a girl crowd-raiser (Clare Presland, aptly tub-thumping and vocally zappy), a rather under-characterised Surveyor (Alexander Byron Hargreaves) and quite a high decibel, robust Activist (Peter Willcock). Some of the best adult soli came from the amateur chorus: several baritones furnished a very presentable vocal match for the full-timers.The storyline or staging occasionally drooped, but it was the children who scored. Two primaries and an infant school yielded the real greenery of this marginally pageant-like sequence. Dormice and Rabbits offered appetising prey for three spectacularly agile, airborne-harnessed Red Kites - an historic feature of the Wormsley Estate - whose inquisitiveness turns them (Sophie Haxworth, Oliver Winter and the endlessly astute, eye-catching 12-year-old Juliette Dudley), into a kind of deus ex machina of the piece (not fully worked through as an idea, but all three performers were magnificent).There were foxes - a foretaste of Vixen? – and squirrels, and more importantly, a dendrologist’s delight: appositely-costumed oak, apple and blossom trees, all of which grace the Wormsley hinterland. When they opened up, even when Stilgoe’s text waxes corny, the huge Garsington stage fired up. So when the long-awaited infants slithered out to announce the discovery of rare newts rendered the impossible Norman’s road project null and void, show and audience collapsed with laughter.Director Karen Gillingham marshalled this scintillating show. Without her precision, it might have been a shambles. Instead, we got an opera. And a lot of electricity with it.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/road-rage-garsington-opera,4
503,"Prom 15: Die Walküre, Staatskapelle Berlin, Barenboim",Prom 15: Die Walküre,Staatskapelle Berlin,2013-07-24,David Nice,"Things may be falling apart, a storm now rages but new broods of humans and demigoddesses have been fathered by chief god Wotan, who has undergone a Doctor Who like transformation from Iain Paterson into Bryn Terfel. Four new top singers appear on the scene after Monday night’s Rheingold superhumans, but Daniel Barenboim is still very much in control to colour and shape another deluxe semi-staged narrative in his Ring epic, this time about the steely warrior-maiden Valkyrie who came to know love.You’d expect Nina Stemme, many people’s favourite Wagnerian soprano, to dominate the picture as Brünnhilde along with Terfel's riven father Wotan. But the elongated tragedy of Die Walküre, the most perfectly self-contained of the four Ring operas, only brings the tetralogy’s redemptive heroine into focus after setting up a lesson in love that’s doomed to fail. So for what is perhaps Wagner’s only Ring act that can be performed successfully by itself, we need two sibling lovers of colossal soul, voice and stamina. Simon O’Neill has the latter two qualities as luckless Siegmund; the Sieglinde of Anja Kampe (pictured below), living all three aspects as if her life depended upon it, is the real star of the evening.O’Neill certainly surprises: what sounds at first like an underweighted, bright tenor voice, more a Loge than a hero, has stops to pull out – first in the thrilling, string-tremolo backed invocation of father Wälse (none other than Wotan), later in rejecting Brünnhilde’s annunciation that he must die at the hands of Hunding, his sister-lover’s betrayed husband, and leave Sieglinde behind on reception into Valhalla. He's infallibly secure, but his acting is gestural (O'Neill pictured below), while Kampe lights up the stage from Sieglinde's first anxious appearance. Her narratives are anchored by wonderful colours in the mid range, while the top – which once faltered in another still-great performance alongside Terfel, in the Zurich Opera Flying Dutchman back in December – holds firm for the biggest adrenalin burst of the evening, her apostrophe to Brünnhilde as woman-hero, saviour of the child she’s carrying within her.Comparisons between Wagnerian divas may be invidious, but here are two types: the one (Kampe) who can't help giving her all and may sacrifice her career sooner rather than later, and the other (Stemme), rock-solid in both the depths and the heights of the range, who wisely marshals her resources. Stemme’s is a narrower sound with a faster vibrato and marginally less distinct words, but she can do everything: the terrifying ""Hojotohos"" of Brünnhilde’s Angela Brazil girl entrance, the solemnity of the Death-Annunciation to Siegmund, the tenderness of the daughter daring all for love. Her first scene with Terfel is dominated, of course, by Wotan’s mighty narrative, where the great bass-baritone starts by following Barenboim’s way of drawing the whole Albert Hall in to catch a whisper but still lacks the last degree of titanic world-weariness – truth to tell, he always has – as the compromised god longs only for the end.And the end of Walküre is, of course, the great scene between father and daughter, which for me was less moving than usual. Whose stamina was most taxed by the heat: brow-mopping Terfel's, Stemme's – she can hardly be blamed for forgetting a couple of lines – Barenboim's or mine? At any rate the turning-points in the rhetoric did not quite have the customary earthshattering impact, even if as assisted by Justin Way’s discreet direction the personenregie, the interaction of two people on stage was as fine as I’ve ever seen it in the Ring. The LED screen came in useful again for the flames surrounding the rock on which the sleeping Brünnhilde is laid.Perhaps the failure of the last act to elicit the tears which poured out of me at the end of the previous ""curtains"" was also due to the bumps that one started to notice in Barenboim’s detail-studded reading. He has never been the most natural master of late-romantic rubato, though as in Rheingold his strings swelled like no others in all the love phrases, woodwind projected aching pathos for both Sieglinde and Brünnhilde and the brass – bass trumpet especially – were as amazing at ringing out into the vasts of the South Ken colosseum as they had been the night before. What a gorgeous vision they all made as scenery behind the singers on the Albert Hall platform, six harps included (DJs could surely have been removed in the heat, though). And the turbo-charged climaxes all made their mark, with clarity and space in the Ride of the Valkyries backed by a slightly uneven line up of Wagnerian ladies (pictured above).We were delighted to welcome back from the previous evening the stylish-human Fricka of glamorous Ekaterina Gubanova and riveting bass Eric Halfvarson, now transformed from giant into another ferocious upholder of loveless family values. Next stop, the trickiest assignment of all – finding a Siegfried worthy of the name. I shall be swapping Wagner for Britten in Norfolk, but there’s always the ever- and anytime-accessible Radio 3 for consolation.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/prom-15-die-walk%C3%BCre-staatskapelle-berlin-barenboim,4
504,"Prom 14: Das Rheingold, Staatskapelle Berlin, Barenboim",Prom 14: Das Rheingold,Staatskapelle Berlin,2013-07-23,David Nice,"Swimming around in the Rhine is what most of us wanted to be doing on the hottest day of the year. A cooling, riverbed low E flat from Daniel Barenboim’s Berlin double basses, and then the staggered horn entries announced we were going to be in the finest sonic hands for two and a half hours  – or nearly 15, if the colossal Proms Ring is to be accounted in its full, four-night glory. And glory it will be in the casting, too, if the flawlessly full, rich voices in the large Rheingold cast are anything to go by.Among the line-up were three singers in the leading men's roles I’d be happy to hear individually in Schubert’s Winterreise, since the text and inflection so seemingly effortlessly modulated to reach to the back of the Albert Hall were theirs above all to command. I thought I'd put the sense of the German to the test, bearing in mind the hall's still woeful lack of surtitles and ignoring my big fat programme text.Johannes Martin Kränzle, indisputably the best Meistersinger Beckmesser of our time, may not be a baritone with yards of inky-black volume to spare for would-be world master Alberich’s climactic curse on the ring, but he made up for that in spades with vocal nuance, stage presence and spitting out of the Nibelung’s especial vehemence. It helped that he was there to dominate from the start, complemented by astonishingly full lower colours in the orchestra to offset against the proto-Debussyan water music of the Rhinemaidens. A good decision, I think, to have a full Wagnerian soprano, Aga Mikolaj, on top – and how magnificent they sounded in their offstage warnings at the other end of the opera. Why the pink, though, for a water nixy - was this one thing overlooked or out of bounds in Justin Way's otherwise discreet but helpful concert-performance direction (Mikolaj, Maria Gortsevskaya and Anna Laposkaja pictured below)?Seasoned Wagnerians proclaimed afterwards that Iain Paterson’s Wotan lacked ultimate authority, but I was spellbound by the most warmly and firmly sung chief god I’ve heard, able to pull out all the stops – abetted by three trumpets, not just the second at first as marked, and why not in the vast auditorium – at Wotan’s last-minute bright idea of heroic salvation. Lyricism was even more the keynote of Stephan Rügamer’s Loge, the flickering intelligence of the gods in fiery yellow and orange striped tie, valuing the quality of still intensity which Way seemed to have instilled into the singers. What a contrast to the laissez-faire, scores-permitted Strauss Capriccio at Covent Garden, even if that cast was just as fineThe central male trio, ratcheting up the tension in the gods’ visit to Nibelheim (Alberich bound, left) and its aftermath, was superbly flanked by other world-class voices. We heard two great, and dramatically no less alert, bass giants in Eric Halfvarson as nasty Fafner and Stephen Milling as love-me-please Fasolt, the resplendent contralto Anna Larsson declaiming Erda’s warning from the organ gallery and a stupendous sound from Jan Buchwald’s Donner in swinging his hammer (this looked like the idiot brother of Wotan’s family, a prejudice dispelled the minute he opened his mouth). Lustrous tone also came from Ekaterina Gubanova’s statuesque Fricka and Anna Samuil’s beauty-goddess Freia in distress.There were times when Barenboim seemed to leave off the conducting, almost disastrously so in the brass cry of woe which should strike after the second sounding of Nibelheim anvils – it almost didn’t happen – and in the smudging of the complacent arpeggios characterising the foolish soon-to-be-Valhallaites. But you could forgive him that for the transparency of the orchestral sound, the telling contribution of every instrumental detail and the close work with singers. I’m sure it was his now-famous wisdom, as something of a Proms doyen, that you should use the tricky venue to bring the audience in, not try and force the sound outwards, which lent such subtlety and meaning to the individual performances.The LED screen at the back did its work in evoking river waves, gold in the water, cloudless skies, fathomless caverns and the final rainbow; in fact, without the box of tricks directors have to throw at this most schematic of the Ring operas, the clarity and meaning billowed and breathed. Tonight a bigger storm breaks and human sympathy can at last enter the picture. I’m sure we won’t be disappointed.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/prom-14-das-rheingold-staatskapelle-berlin-barenboim,4
505,"La Bohème, Longborough Festival",La Bohème,Longborough Festival,2013-07-21,stephen Walsh,"Having spent most of the summer on Wagner’s Ring, Longborough are now giving, as a kind of bergamasque, an opera whose entire length would fit into the first act of Götterdämmerung. La Bohème is everything The Ring is not. It is concise, melodious, playful, sentimental and weepy. Yet oddly enough, it could never have been written without Wagner. Puccini’s ears were open to every kind of influence, and quick to transform everything into a personal expression. So Bohème thrives on leitmotifs, skilfully worked transitions, complex simultaneities, and thematic orchestration – all those devices Wagner laid down as the essence of music drama. And it never once sounds like Wagner.As with Wagner, the small Longborough stage poses problems for Puccini’s sometimes intricate dramaturgy. But it also offers advantages. After all, Bohème is essentially a conversation piece with one big ensemble scene, and it works well close up. The director-designer, Richard Studer, has made the most of this. Cleverly using a two-tier set to bring the main action to the front of the stage, he can zoom in on the bohemian antics and love music of the outer acts, while reserving the upper level to give wider angles for the Café Momus and ironic depth to the third act, where Mimi overhears Rodolfo’s passionate complaints and avowals about her to Marcello.As yet, the execution of all this is less tidy than the concept, but that will improve (there was an excuse: a fuse blew at the end of Act 1, knocking out the stage monitors just in time for Momus, with all its complexities of ensemble and staging). Instead, the freshness of the singing and acting goes a long way towards papering over any cracks in the fabric of the performance. A youngish cast is in its element in this tragedy of student life; there are children close enough to watch their faces; and Studer’s staging, happily devoid of superfluous props, achieves atmosphere with suitably run-down costumery, a table here and a street lamp there – perhaps not quite the Paris of Murger, or even Puccini, but a pauper’s Paris of, I suppose, 1950s vintage, and discriminatingly lit by Wayne Dowdeswell.A lot hangs in Bohème on the lead duo, though I’ve known the work rescued by a dazzling Musetta. Not necessary here, though Fiona Murphy does sparkle in her waltz, taken quite slowly, then switches convincingly to the self-effacing angel of the last act. Katie Bird (pictured above right, with Robyn Lyn Evans) is a lovely, clear-voiced Mimi, always it seems with plenty in reserve at the top, where Puccini often piles on the orchestral volume. Robyn Lyn Evans, as Rodolfo, is not yet wholly equal to this requirement though his lightish spinto tenor is otherwise ideal for this music and will, for sure, fill out in time.Their first-act duet, produced as a lonely-hearts set-up (the key dropped and the candles blown out all very candidly on purpose), is beautifully handled, the darker third-act duo, upstage, hardly less so. Grant Doyle is a strong Marcello with a fine lyrical streak of his own. Aidan Smith (Colline) and Gerard Collett (Schaunard) round out a good team of hopeless artists, somehow symbolized by Schaunard and his wretched coat, which he parts with like Dido lamenting Aeneas, to buy medicine that cures nothing.The ensemble work, under the excellent Jonathan Lyness, is compellingly good, and will be even better when the electrics behave. Lovely singing and spontaneous acting from a smallish group of children, sprightly chorus work from Momus’s Christmas clientele, and fine orchestral playing throughout. Perhaps Puccini shouldn’t feel like a relief after the rigours of Valhalla. But he does.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-boh%C3%A8me-longborough-festival,4
506,"Capriccio, Royal Opera",Capriccio,Royal Opera,2013-07-20,David Nice,"Richard Strauss’s lavish postscript to 50 years of music theatre is about so much more than the theme of its source, Salieri’s Prima la musica e poi le parole (""first the music and then the words"", with a big invisible question mark). Its overall subject of rival claims in opera also embraces spoken drama, poetry, dance and specific bel canto, all of them marshalled by the most experienced of theatre directors. And a director is what this concert performance probably needed to bring its cast members into dramatic harmony. Different levels of experience may have been at play, but at least the line-up was as classy as they come, with the prima donna, Renée Fleming, as the ultimate reason for the event's brief existence.There were two seasoned professionals, Fleming as muse of opera the Countess Madeleine and Peter Rose as the Max Reinhardt of an anachronistic 18th century Parisian salon, trading deliciously on their stage experience (pictured below in the Met production) and a third, Bo Skovhus as the Countess’s musically illiterate brother, going over the top with a relish we couldn’t always share as he relived his. There were two newcomers stepping into distinguished shoes, tenor Andrew Staples’s ardent composer Flamand as a replacement for the lovely Joseph Kaiser and the beautiful, opulent-voiced mezzo Tanja Ariane Baumgartner filling the gap left by much-missed Christine Rice in the role of the great actress Clairon; both are destined to be the best exponents of their roles but remain as yet a little tied to the score of this demandingly conversational one-off. Christian Gerhaher was valiantly back on stage after a back operation as saturnine poet Olivier, colouring every word but inevitably constricted to a chair for the most part.Holding to the opera’s tenet that ""the magic of music solves every problem""–  a line lost, along with Straussian self-quotation, in this performance’s least explicable small cut - conductor Andrew Davis kept it all on the move, a little too much so in the opening string sextet, not spacious enough to let co-concert master Sergey Levitin and his Royal Opera Orchestra colleagues properly inhabit their elaborate neoclassical phrases. But once the orchestrally jewel-studded musical conversation was on the boil, Davis missed no trick in Strauss’s illuminated manuscript of a score. Soulful interludes had all the quiet glow they needed, if not a climactic sensuousness, and the placing of the three delicate chords around the final horn calls at magical curtain-down formed a last symbol of his perfectionism.The discussion will never be to everyone’s taste; I could sense very different levels of enjoyment around me, not least from a neighbour who fiddled with her press release and a chattering couple who left just before the entertainment that might have delighted them. That's the duet of a Neapolitan tenor and soprano, hilariously over the top in the hands of golden-voiced Barry Banks and Mary Plazas, friends reunited some years after their perfect partnership in the English National Opera production of Donizetti’s L’elisir d’amore.Davis’s pace (the conductor pictured left) and the singers’ lively intelligence brought home how Strauss, like Wagner before him, introduces new ideas and changes of register every 10 or so minutes. This may be the non-plot famously described as ""after 45 minutes, chocolate is served"", but it has its high spots, and they were all as near perfect as Strauss’s demands would allow. There was composer Flamand’s cool but beautiful setting of Olivier’s sonnet – actually by Ronsard – where Staples ignited an ardour more fully unleashed in his love scene with the Countess. There were the “what is opera” fugue crisply kicked off by Gerhaher and two brilliant octets culminating in director La Roche’s baby-egotistical plea to write him an opera that touches the soul. Strauss sets it in a cruelly high register for his bass-buffo, and at a couple of points you could sense the strain for Rose after so much authoritative delivery, but there’s still no other bass around who could handle the wittily-despatched German setting so crisply or meaningfully.You had to love the little vignette-intermezzo for servants – five out of the eight fine young singers on the Royal Opera’s Jette Parker Young Artists Programme – and the weird twilight scene for king of the underground Monsieur Taupe the prompt, a gem of solipsistic characterization from Graham Clark. But ultimately Strauss clears the stage for his soprano and a last gran scena where, although we can’t really care about her erotic dilemma of choosing between poet and composer, the orchestra and the generous vocal line once again triumph.Fleming, having sparkled with immaculate good graces and relaxed body language throughout the chatter, soared as only she can. Once or twice the voice wouldn’t quite do what she wanted it to – I was lucky enough to witness sheer perfection a couple of days earlier – but there was plenty of engagement and awe-inspiring breath control to admire. It is at the end, said Strauss, that a composer can achieve his finest results. He did so at the age of 78, retreating to his musical world-within-world from the barbarism around him, and he’s very lucky indeed to have such interpreters around today to plead his special case. MORE RICHARD STRAUSS ON THEARTSDESKDer Rosenkavalier, Royal Opera (2009).

507,"Don Pasquale, Glyndebourne Festival Opera",Don Pasquale,Glyndebourne Festival Opera,2013-07-19,stephen Walsh,"Her tongue firmly planted in her cheek, Mariame Clément grumbles in the Glyndebourne programme that Don Pasquale “poses no specific ‘conceptual’ challenge” to the opera director. Sighs of relief all round. Donizetti’s final comic masterpiece turns out to be “about” nothing but its own subtly nuanced retelling of the stock tale of the old buffer who plans to marry his ward, nephew’s sweetheart, or some such, but is outwitted by her with the help of a smart confederate. But that, it also emerges in Clément’s witty and intelligent production first staged on the tour two years ago but new now to the Festival, is quite enough to be going on with.Above all, we’re spared any updating: Don Pasquale as Berlusconi etc, etc. Clément sets the piece, if anything, back in time, circa 1780, though Donizetti – writing in 1843 – doesn’t specify period in his stage directions. She has a few tweaks of her own. Instead of the flock of servants hired by the profligate Norina, she gives us a stage audience, Gozzi-style, in white outfits and powdered wigs, an idea that won a round of applause from the real audience but for me slightly undermined the profligacy. And she has, in Julia Hansen, a brilliant designer with a sure sense of idiom. Her tripartite revolve not only makes for rapid scene changes to match the speed of the action, but it’s a delightfully witty concept in its own right.More importantly, Clément seizes on Malatesta, the manipulative doctor, and adds a new and all too believable liaison dangéreuse between him and Norina. Does this contradict Donizetti’s happy ending, as my colleague David Nice suggested in his review of the tour? The problem with Don Pasquale, if there has to be one, is that the presumed hero Ernesto (as the only tenor in a work full of baritones) is little more than a cipher with a couple of charming songs and a decorative rather than passionate love duet, staged here as a kind of Embarquement pour Cythère amid the powdered wigs. The flighty Norina will surely tire of him pretty quick. Then Malatesta, too, had better watch out.So even Donizetti can set you thinking while you revel in his adorable bel canto tunefulness and exquisite orchestration, delivered here with incomparable style by the LPO under Enrique Mazzola. And what a cast! Possibly the work’s original Paris cast, which had four of the greatest Italian opera singers of the day (Lablache, Grisi, Tamburini and Mario), would have outsung the Glyndebourne team, if not by much. But they could hardly have matched it for sheer presence and vitality.Alessandro Corbelli’s Pasquale is both a stock character and something more, as Clément suggests in her note, a target for affection as much as ridicule, with his hangdog face and quick grasp of what’s what. His patter duet with Nikolay Borchev’s clever, impassive Malatesta is a high point of the evening, and – in true Donizettian fashion – was encored. The Ernesto, Enea Scala – the one survivor from the tour cast, and a late stand-in here for the indisposed Alek Schrader – made the best of this slightly under-coloured role, delivering its ornate vocal lines with complete aplomb, if in a somewhat reedy timbre that might not please everyone.But perhaps the real manipulator, after all, is Norina herself, the original merry widow (pictured above right), a match for anyone in Danielle de Niese’s hands and voice. She took time, on the first night, to warm up, not helped perhaps by Clément having her seated, not very elegantly, for most of her first aria. But once in her stride, she’s unstoppable, as much in control of the coloratura as of the situation, and as ever compulsively watchable.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/don-pasquale-glyndebourne-festival-opera,5
508,"Britten: The Canticles, Linbury Studio Theatre",Britten: The Canticles,Linbury Studio Theatre,2013-07-11,David Nice,"As good old Catullus put it, I hate and love, you may ask why. No doubt it's my job as a critic to probe such difficult responses to Britten's Canticles. Why am I so repelled by the sickly-sweet lullaby Isaac sings just before daddy's about to put him to the sword in Canticle II, then so haunted by the sombre war requiem of Britten's Edith Sitwell setting, Canticle III? Ambivalence about Ian Bostridge's weird dominating presence and Neil Bartlett's marshalling of five responses to the five very different narratives doesn't make it any easier. Then again, there's no reason why anything should be simple, even if it sometimes sounds so, in Britten.The only consistency about this odd hour's internment, reaching London from Brighton and Snape, is Paule Constable's hauntingly lit arena, and perhaps her staging of the least approachable canticle of all, setting Eliot's ""The Journey of the Magi"" as a creepy three-part narrative for countertenor, tenor and baritone (more much-needed anchoring from Benedict Nelson). The reason it works is because Constable trusts the singers, wearing coats and carrying suitcases, to paint the story, with a little help from the shifting light around them.Bartlett's dumbshow breakfast scene between two 1930s lovers (Edward Evans and Peter Bray) for Canticle I, ""My beloved is mine"", is a poignant enough response to one of Britten's many lovesongs to his life-partner Peter Pears. But it interferes with the rather placid voice-and-piano narrative rather than complementing it. And Bostridge's body language is the thing the director really needs to work on, to stop the bending and paradoxically at the same time to unbend our tortuous tenor.Puzzling, too, is Scott Graham's choreography to ""Abraham and Isaac"" (dancers Chris Akrill and Gavin Persand pictured right). Is it trying to underline what I feel about the setting, that here is another of Britten's queasy innocence-and-experience works stemming from his extraordinary revelation to trusted sources that he was raped by a schoolmaster, possibly even abused by his father? Might the lingering-on of malign consequences into adulthood be a justification for using the most liquid-voiced of all countertenors, Iestyn Davies, as the son rather than any of the trebles or boy altos around today who might do the part a more appropriate justice?Certainly the grim undertow of the Sitwell setting, ""Still Falls the Rain"", came as something of a relief, though you feel this is the toughness that should have been applied to the horrid Old Testament tale. Bostridge, a haunting tenor who still disarms with the lack of a vocal core to his superb artistry, came into his own here as a ghost-voice, unforgettable in the refrains and spookily intertwined at times with Richard Watkins's peerless horn playing. Artist John Keane's film was as apt as Derek Jarman's montage of war footage for the Libera me in his film of War  Requiem; yet still, in both cases, one has to ask if image can add any more to the austere powere of the music. Imagery was rigorously focused, too, in Julius Drake's superlatively clear interpretations of four very different piano parts.A dancing Narcissus (Dan Watson) as choroeographed by Wendy Houston played off rather better against the late distillation of Canticle V, which Britten wrote shortly before his death, providing a role for harpist Osian Ellis - again, flawlessly taken here by Sally Pryce - when he could no longer partner Pears at the piano. It was, no question, a fine and testing tribute of an evening to the shifting styles of nearly three decades' compositional mastery.  That it left a nasty taste, in my mouth at any rate, had to do with both the works and the productions. Good or bad, again, you may ask which, and again I still can't tell you.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/britten-canticles-linbury-studio-theatre,3
509,"Fortunio, Grange Park Opera",Fortunio,Grange Park Opera,2013-07-11,stephen Walsh,"André Messager is one of those fringe composers whose music you feel you know something about until you try to think of a specific piece. His ballet Les deux pigeons is still sometimes revived. But to students of French music, he’s actually best known as the conductor who brought Debussy’s Pelléas to the stage and conducted its first performance. Of his own operas and operettas, Fortunio seems to have been the most successful in its day (1907); but I confess I’d heard never a note of it until this new production at Grange Park by Daniel Slater.It’s a work which reminds us that French operetta and opéra comique often cross the boundaries supposedly defined by those titles. It starts off apparently as an operetta. A lawyer’s clerk, Landry (Tristan Stocks) tunefully extols the youthful charms of his elderly boss’s wife, Jacqueline, then introduces her to a green youth (Fortunio) recently up from the country; though generally regarded as pure and untouchable, she is quickly seduced by a ludicrous captain of dragoons called Clavaroche (Quirijn de Lang), who is next seen tumbling out of her wardrobe where he’s been hiding from her jealous husband (Timothy Dawkins). (Pictured: Quirijn De Lang as Clavaroche and Ilona Domnich as Jacqueline).So far so Offenbach. But matters now take a more serious turn. Clavaroche has singled Fortunio out as what the French call a chandelier, that is a decoy to distract the husband from the real threat. But alas, Fortunio falls instantly and passionately in love with Jacqueline, and, worse still, she falls for him, drawn in, like Verdi’s Violetta, by the sheer intensity of his emotion. The final scene, with dragoons patrolling the garden and Fortunio barely concealed behind Jacqueline’s bedroom door, has the makings of a genuinely tragic dénouement. But Messager baulks at this, and instead lowers the curtain with the two lovers in each others’ arms and the situation unresolved.Like the plot, Messager’s music swings disconcertingly between the frothy and the tortured, between (say) Offenbach and Wagner, a composer he admired and often conducted. There are lovely things in the simple, lyrical style of opérette, more elaborate echoes of Chabrier and Massenet, and a few rather heavy Wagnerisms, half-digested, as usual in fin de siècle French music. Fortunio’s declaration of love surprises the audience as much as Jacqueline by its Tristanesque fervour, but is preceded by a lovely fugal prelude that only Fauré could have inspired. To call the work a hotchpotch would do it an injustice; it hangs together, but only just.Slater’s staging respects the spirit of Messager’s time: the France of Feydeau and Maupassant, but also of Dreyfus and Zola. Above all he uses the open stage well to help the music move, not cluttering it up with modish apparatus, as in his Garsington Don Giovanni last year and Seraglio this. It’s a very watchable, stylish production. The singing, though, is variable. I like Ilona Domnich’s Jacqueline – a nice blend of the respectable and the sensual; and Alex Vearey Roberts catches Fortunio’s callow directness of feeling while sometimes straining for his notes. With the other singers, all opera specialists, one is often conscious of some attempt to find a particular, not too operatic style to match the vaudeville aspects of the music. They could, one feels, sing this music more richly and beautifully. Perhaps Toby Purser, in the pit, could give them more space, instead of sometimes bullying them into strict tempi that the music, too, resists. The orchestra plays with polish, but now and then ensemble suffers.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/fortunio-grange-park-opera,3
510,Britten and Poulenc at the Cheltenham Music Festival,Britten and Poulenc at the Cheltenham Music Festival,,2013-07-11,David Nice,"""Britten or Poulenc?"" The question may seem a fatuous one, geared to the 100th anniversary of the Englishman's birth and 50 years since the Frenchman's death. Yet it certainly livens up what would otherwise be the usual dreary artists' biographies, presented with typical elan in this year's Cheltenham Music Festival programme book. ""Has anyone said Poulenc in response to this?"" asks pianist James Rhodes. Well, yes - no less than 13 of the performers, including doyenne of both composers Felicity Lott, as against 21 for Britten, with six ""I couldn't possibly chooses"" in the middle.Festival Director Meurig Bowen doesn't have to commit, but he has shown much more faith in chameleonic, saintly Francis than, say, the Proms, where you'll only find one Poulenc work on the programme, and a chamber piece at that. In terms of the big events, Cheltenham this year boasts the kind of entirely home-grown spectacular which should be a justification for any music festival near the beginning, Britten's Noye's Fludde in heavenly Tewkesbury Abbey, and another special occasion with no less than five top choirs, Poulenc's spiritual-joyous masterpiece the Gloria, in Gloucester Cathedral towards the end.  My own three-day slice of Cheltenham began with a summoning of bells in high Poulencian style - the 1950s Sonata for Two Pianos played by Joseph Tong and Waka Hasegawa (pictured right by Miki Araki). This duo must have muscles of steel for the kind of mega-programme they were offering. Theirs was hardly the usual morning aperitif in the fabulous Pittville Pump Room, approached in my case via the most heavenly rus in urbe walk imaginable across the lawns and around the lake of the Pittville Estate from the peaceful Townhouse just within the boundaries of spa-exploiter Joseph Pitt's once-exclusive Elysium. The first half alone also embraced Britten's surprisingly monumental Introduction and Rondo all Burlesca, the obliquely charming miniature childsplay of Dai Fujikura's brand-new Three Miniatures - this has been quite a year for him already - and Grainger's epic ramble through Gershwin's Porgy and Bess, showing an equal master's touch in the playful transcription of ""It Ain't Necessarily So"".Tong and Hasegawa are well matched: he excels in the Russian-school thunder, she in the clarion carillons at the top of the register. Their Rite of Spring was well-tempered and always clear-textured, if not cumulatively overwhelming. Balm came with the encore - Poulenc's ravishing but simple Élégie, a piece I fell in love with only a few months ago and little thought I'd hear in live performance so soon. Poulenc's proposed cognac on the piano and a cigar in hand would have to be imagined for health and safety reasons, quipped Tong, but the nostalgic tribute to a lost friend certainly touched the necessary depths.I caught the first available afternoon bus to Tewkesbury, the longer to admire the Abbey's Norman grandeur, Tudor chantries and 14th-century ceilings. The designer of Noye's Fludde, inspirational children's book author and illustrator turned live-art concert presenter James Mayhew, had taken into account the green men and the animals of the roof bosses. His in-the-round Britten, with a giant ark rising above the floor of the nave's west end, began with some of the 150 children entrusted with animal headdresses, banners and mannequins rushing and squeaking around the queue to enter the Abbey and ended with our exit along the yew avenue to the main street lined by same: enchanting for all.But if Noye's Fludde embraces children's talents at the highest possible level, it is in some ways as adult and as profound an opera - albeit for liturgical spaces only - as Britten ever wrote, and equal to local memories of 2007 in Tewkesbury, when the Abbey stood as an ark above the floods. The passacaglia of the storm, with the rearing repetitive phrases led by the Carducci Quartet alongside the schools orchestra in the belly of the ark, builds to a blinding climax where we, the congregation, are drawn in to sing a verse of ""Eternal Father, Strong to Save"".The handbells which ring out the rainbow of Donald Maxwell's supremely authoritative God brought tears to the eyes, and the final protracted processional, all waving banners, bobbing heads and rushing exultation, was a Wagnerian vision I'll never forget. We may have paid the price of the decision to ignore the Abbey's perilous acoustics and play to east, west and south, but the ending justified everything. This is something the Gloucestershire children, benefitting from the inspirational leadership of Mayhew, stalwart baritone Philip Smith as Noye, conductor Glyn Oxley and director Edward Derbyshire, will remember all their lives.In one of those typical festival clashes, witnessing the Tewkesbury Fludde meant missing The Lighthouse Keepers, David Sawer's new musical ""radio play"" for the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group back in Cheltenham's swish newish Parabola Arts Centre. Because five new Gloucestershire songs for children's choir, conducted by Rachel Bowen, had fleshed out the Abbey experience, I only got to hear the last 20 minutes of Words and Music in the BCMG second half, Samuel Beckett's saga of love among ruins elegiacally punctuated by Morton Feldman at his most haunting. It was enough to strike as an extreme contrast with the giant, extrovert pageant I'd just witnessed.Friday morning, the day summer began, was further irradiated in the Pump Room by the majestic Schubert Ensemble (pictured right), whose perfect roundings-off brought special magic to the coda of the Andante cantabile in Schumann's beautifully proportioned E flat Piano Quartet. New or recent music by the Matthews brothers brought little enlightenment. Colin's Nowhere to Hide for piano trio belied its title - a playful suggestion by John Adams, who might have brought some fun to the combination - with evasions of substance and a strange four-movement structure including a lullaby in memory of Elliott Carter that didn't seem to fit with the rest.David's Four Portraits began well with a sumptuous homage to both the pianist, William Howard, and his personal touch in Chopin, but slumped into more conventional platitudes. Transcendence had to wait for what has to be the most soul-lifting Piano Quartet in the repertoire, Fauré's C minor masterpiece. The Schuberts kept the sentiment in disciplined check but never stinted on the playfulness.More uplift came that evening where least expected, in a concert I'd never have gone to had the circumstances not so prevailed: young Swingle Swingers celebrating their many-times-morphed ensemble's 50th birthday in the ballroom of the Town Hall. The presentation might have been purposefully cool, an attempt to counter their reputation as favourites of Alan Partridge, though it verged on the inept: a group in need of an image consultant, perhaps. No matter: the substance was beguilingly harmonised, whether Beyonce or Bach, the girls stratospheric, tenor(ish) Oliver Griffiths an accomplished crooner. Top marks, too, to their sound engineer for giving the miking such depth and magic.Of its kind, this was top of the range. One couldn't, unfortunately, say the same for soprano Sarah Gabriel's presentation of Poulenc's La Voix Humaine, the three-quarter-hour telephone conversation of a woman at the end of a passionate relationship. Let's just say that Gabriel is a very fine actress, a good case for doing the Cocteau original and not Poulenc's setting. There were still pleasures to be had from hearing those lush harmonies in the fine hands of pianist Christopher Glynn. But the mobile-era update didn't tally with the telephone-exchange confusions of the original and frankly I can't wait to hear the hypnotic orchestral version again as intended. A quality redhead was centre-stage the following morning, the already great mezzo Christianne Stotijn with no less a pianist as her partner than Imogen Cooper (pictured left in the Pittville Pump Room by Phil Stapleton). Given that both, individually, have given two of the most memorable performances of anything I can remember, with Ivan Fischer and the Budapest Festival Orchestra - Stotijn in Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde and Cooper in Beethoven's First Piano Concerto - this was always going to be a highlight. We started with great late Schubert including the long and mesmerising ""Winter Evening"", not in disharmony with the beautiful morning, and Janet Baker's Britten-sanctioned transposition of his Winter Words song-cycle. Stotijn's English is predictably idiomatic for a Dutchwoman, but the slightly backward placement which gives such depth to her interpretations didn't always project to the middle-back of the Pump Room. And for all the praise which tends to be lavished on  Britten's Hardy settings, I couldn't help wishing for less fussiness in the music and more of Poulenc's song-heart.Which is probably why A Charm of Lullabies, Britten's rainbow of varied cradle-songs, made more of an impact. Cooper, who held us spellbound with the little skips of Schubert's first Impromptu at the start of the second half, wrought wonders with every phrase ending in all of the songs. In Musorgsky's The Nursery, Stotijn foresook glances at the score and inhabited the worlds of child and nurse with all the colours in the voice so available to her and what seemed to me like flawless Russian (more text this time). Tchaikovsky's ""My Guardian, my Angel, my Friend"" wove a final magic. Let's hope this new partnership flourishes: the comparison with Pears and Britten as pianist doesn't seem too far fetched given the profound musicality of both performers.If my dip into Cheltenham's musical stream had begun with Poulenc, it ended with Britten's Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra as you never saw it before. And I mean ""see"", because this was my first chance to catch Mayhew's revolutionary way of presenting serious music for children. He's not interested in snippety events with Doctor Who themes and Rides of the Valkyries; he wants to bring a whole work alive and prove it's possible for kids to sit rapt for anything up to an hour. And so he narrates, draws and paints the music as it's happening (pictured right by Tobias Benjamin Lever). A giant screen enlarges his easel action. In this case his partners could not have been more apt - Chetham's [School] Symphony Orchestra under conductor Stephen Threlfall, sounding every inch the mature professional ensemble. The young persons in the Town Hall auditorium did indeed sit rapt as Mayhew conjured a jungle scene for the woodwind, a singing whale for Britten's melancholy cellos, brassy knights on horseback and a dino-scape for the percussion. With an intelligent reprise for the whole thing eventually crowned by the fugue, Mayhew also had time to re-people a new sheet with Britten himself, recognisable in three strokes of the pen, at the centre. There was a raffle for the pictures, a book-signing and then we had a long chat about this new method of musical appreciation for children, a subject close to both our hearts, before I dashed for the train back to London.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/britten-and-poulenc-cheltenham-music-festival,4
511,Double French: the 35th Buxton Festival,Double French: the 35th Buxton Festival,,2013-07-08,philip Radcliffe,"Retrieving buried rarities, many even by famous composers, is the cornerstone of the Buxton Festival, now in its 35th year. This time around, artistic director Stephen Barlow has plucked out a pair of 19th-century French comic operas by Saint-Saëns and Gounod, coupling them in a double bill to kick-start the Festival.Under Francis Matthews’s direction, aided by Lez Brotherston’s inspired design (brilliantly lit as usual by John Bishop), the two are cleverly yoked together on stage by placing them in adjacent apartments, one beneath the other, in 1890s Paris. And the stories do both concern frustrated love affairs which end happily.Saint-Saëns’ La princesse jaune, first performed in 1872, is not so much a comedy as a satire on the penchant at the time for all things Japanese, pre-dating The Mikado by 13 years. Here we have artist Kornélis in his attic atelier, besotted by a life-size portrait of the kimono-draped princess he calls Ming. His cousin Léna battles for his love against his obsession and drug-fuelled hallucinations, during which he sees her briefly transformed into the princess. I would like to have seen much more made of the hallucinatory Japanese images and of the Léna/Princesse transformation (main image).The production gains much from being spoken and sung in French, using the original Louis Gallet libretto, especially since Anne-Sophie Duprels as Léna is so alluring and sings so beautifully. Ryan MacPherson, a fine tenor, is suitably distracted as Kornélis. Barlow conducted the Northern Chamber Orchestra briskly and with a real feel for Saint-Saëns' delightful score, amusingly punctuated by faux Japanese-style passages.By some miracle of staging, during the interval the attic studio is elevated to a higher level to accommodate a large apartment with floor-to-ceiling windows, dazzlingly back-lit, for Gounod’s La Colombe (1866). Some of us are old enough to recall that this opera was staged here 30 years ago.It’s a silly story, which focuses on Horace (the versatile Ryan MacPherson again, ideally suited to this role), who is in love with Countess Sylvia. He even names his pet caged dove after her. The Countess wants the dove to be a match for a parrot owned by her own society rival. She visits Horace, falls for him and stays for dinner. Being hard up, Horace decides with his servant to roast the dove for the main course. What Horace doesn’t know until after dinner is that his servant and the Countess’s butler have saved the dove and what they’ve eaten for dinner is the famous parrot. Some joke, eh? And it does take rather too long to play out.The whole production is splendidly played. Gillian Keith makes an affecting Countess and her coloratura singing is outstanding, Jonathan Best makes for a humorous butler, but Emma Carrington steals the show with her comedic gifts as Mazet, Horace’s boisterous godson-servant (pictured above right). And the ensemble singing is a joy.Barlow has reinstated the Poulenc recitatives, commissioned by Diaghilev to replace the spoken dialogue of the original. He also has a new - and witty - English translation by Hugh Macdonald, which adds to the fun. And the sheer tunefulness of Gounod’s score is a delight.The other Buxton Festival production is Mozart’s La finta giardiniera, written when he was eighteen. Here we are in the familiar world of opera buffa confusion, the comedic world of intrigue, deception, disguise - and madness. But in this dazzling, bold and inventive production we have a novel modern setting under Harry Fehr’s direction. And it is stylishly staged for the most part in an upmarket marquee, with draped and chandeliers, being set up for a wedding reception. Yannis Thoravis’s design, with John Bishop’s lighting, is bright, colourful and classy.For a production full of ideas and fun, Fehr has an exceptional seven-strong cast, who give a first-rate ensemble performance. The story starts and ends with the Marchesa Violante being left for dead by her jealous lover Belfiore. She survives and the deception begins as she assumes another name (Sandrina) and servant status, going to work for the mayor as a florist, giving rise to many complications. But it all ends well with love and marriage.In the title role, Ellie Laugharne (pictured above left) makes an attractive Violante, strongly matched by Andrew Kennedy’s Belfiore. And there’s a show-stopping, action-packed tirade by Stephanie Corley as the feisty Arminda, Violante’s bridal rival for Belfiore. Nicholas Kraemer’s conducting of the Northern Chamber Orchestra was wonderfully alert, bringing out the joyful nuances of Mozart’s youthful score, looking ahead to Così and Figaro.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/double-french-35th-buxton-festival,
512,"Hippolyte et Aricie, Glyndebourne Festival Opera",Hippolyte et Aricie,Glyndebourne Festival Opera,2013-06-30,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"Jean-Philippe Rameau wrote Hippolyte et Aricie in 1733 at the age of 50. It was his first opera and his greatest. In its five acts, its visits to the woods of Diana, the groves of Venus, the fires of Pluto and the domestic meltdown in the house of Phaedra, is some of the most assured, inventive and stylish music ever written for the stage. As operatic debuts go, it is a miracle. That William Christie, the pre-eminent French Baroque specialist of our age, would be capable of summoning up some of the premiere’s dazzle was not surprising. But that Jonathan Kent would be able to match that sense of wonder that greeted 18th-century Parisians with a staging that both channelled a multi-media Baroque spirit but also got to the work’s intimate core was a revelation.We began, of course, in a fridge-freezer. ""Huh?"" some cried. Opera’s seen many a fridge-freezer in recent years, from the big walk-in meat storers (Turandot, ENO) to the cheap Dixon’s knock-offs (King Arthur, ENO). This one was exaggeratedly large – large enough to fit the choir and two goddesses – and French. So, who might make this trope of modern consumerism their home? Diana, of course, queen of the hunt, patron saint of the frigid.It was neat. But it was by no means the most neat scene we’d see. Next up came Diana’s Maurizio Catelan-inspired abattoir, four real deer strung up dead, blood pouring from their mouths. Even more ingenious was Pluto’s domain in Act Three where we explored the flea-ridden, cobwebbed back of the fridge. For the domestic unravelling in Act Four, the curtain lifted on a cross-section of the ruling family home, the fateful drama unfolding like a frieze across the modish bedrooms and living room.True to its time, purity is absent. Generosity and spectacle are the order of the day. We get Noughties designs here, 18th-century costume there (designer: Paul Brown). The plot allows it. The fecund music – hungrily zig-zagging across vast, previously uncharted textural and harmonic terrain – demands it. For those expecting Racine’s Phaedra, it will disappoint, maybe even horrify. Rameau’s librettist Abbé Pellegrin subsumes all the sober interior turmoil of Phaedra into a lavish grand opera that takes in several prolonged (and, it has to be said, dramatically static) visits to the Gods. Nonetheless there is time for much intimate activity too. Kent is not averse to Racine-ifying proceedings when necessary. Two of the most heart-stopping moments in this production – moments that belie the idea that French Baroque opera is all surface and no soul – are moments of great classical restraint. The first is the breakdown of Phaedra in her bedroom in Act Three, while the object of her desire, her step-son Hippolyte, does his teenage thing next door. The second is at the end of Act Four. The curtain falls to leave Phaedra alone, the lights narrow to a spot and, in silence, she descends to meet her fate, eying us accusingly. The only misstep in the production was in the pat choreography from Ashley Page, who rather than taking on the ravishing dance music, sends them up in moments of half-arsed campness. That both the best moments involved Sarah Connolly was no coincidence. Her ability to inhabit these complex, tortured women – remember her Medea this year – is peerless. And so it was inevitable perhaps that her rendition of “Cruelle mère des amours” would be the hypnotic heart of the evening. But this was a cast full of talent. Ed Lyon (Hippolyte), a Christie favourite and a bit of a French Baroque star across the channel, finally got the chance to show off his skills here. He can be a little pushed and get a little nasally up high but he’s a terrific actor and a wonderful stylist. Whether as a red-faced and behorned Pluto or sweaty and bare-chested Neptune, François Lis was a decent bad guy, though slightly upstaged by Loic Felix as the yelping Pluto sidekick, Tisiphone.The guys were good. But the girls were great. Hatching from an egg in the fridge, Ana Quintans’ Cupid, a punkish chick in this production, was, in her sparkling tone, a model siren of desire. The same attractiveness of sound could be found in the delicious though small contributions from Emmanuelle de Negri (Huntress and Nightingale) and Julie Pasturaud (Oenone). The star act though was Christiane Karg as Aricie.It’s a role created by Pellegrin, to move the focus of the story away from the damaged goods that Phaedra represents to something more wholesome and youthtful. For our times, this can all seem a bit drippy. But not in Karg’s hands. This manipulated innocent becomes something quite mesmerising. Karg's ability to control and colour her vocal line, making every ornament, every delicious port de voix and coulez, tell within the context of the words, meant she manipulated us as much as they her.Of course the cue for this exquisite colourism came ultimately from Christie and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, who teased us in a ravishing way, especially when the flutes took control of the musical eddies. It was a reminder that, for all the activity on stage, the night belonged to Rameau. The variety, richness and experimentation of his writing – the solos, duets, trios, choruses, a cappella and accompanied, all exquisitely orchestrated  – allows his operas to be fleet of foot in a way few others would be before or since. As fellow composer Andre Campra remarked at the premiere, ""There is enough music in this opera to make 10 of them.” Few nights at the opera will be as rewarding as this one.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/hippolyte-et-aricie-glyndebourne-festival-opera,4
513,"Simon Boccanegra, Royal Opera",Simon Boccanegra,Royal Opera,2013-06-28,ismene Brown,"Revivals are for a conductor to show off some voices he’s discovered, do some role debuts, develop some careers, and as far as the production's concerned pour new wine into old bottles. There was some good new wine in this revival of Elijah Moshinsky's 22-year-old production. The Abkhazian soprano Hibla Gerzmava was the shining beauty, doing her first Amelia, with a sterling new tenor voice coming from the American Russell Thomas. Thomas Hampson made his house debut in the role of pirate-turned-Doge Simon Boccanegra, and Dimitri Platanias - a previous Rigoletto in the house - debuted as his secret foe, Paolo Albiani. So all in all, a lot of first times out.So where's a director when all these people need him? The stage still looks fine - Michael Yeargan’s airy columnar set, open to the sky, shows an elegantly spare marble interior of a Genoese palazzo - but there's a lot of space for the performers to animate, and the acting last night was mostly dreadful. The singers appear to have been pushed on stage and told to get on with it.No matter how good the singing, in this particular opera, with its limping plot, you sorely need direction to help the characters show the audience the taut personal relationships that Verdi is really interested in. The Prologue sets up feuds that will endure to the last scene: Boccanegra the dashing pirate voted in as Doge thanks to a kingmaker who will 25 years later turn against him, kidnap his daughter, and see to his poisoning. Meanwhile, Boccanegra will discover that his lost child is living under his nose in Genoa 25 years later.The plot problems cascade in. All the exciting things happen off stage - premature death, murder, riot, abduction, execution - while on stage you only see people standing around. But it shouldn't be insoluble. In the absence of action, we have at the centre a father-and-daughter relationship, surrounded by the usual suspects: father’s bitter enemies, daughter’s lover and various plotters, which give rise to some stirring duets and trios, and the great council ensemble where dozens of male voices are capped with a single soaring soprano voice, that of Amelia.Vocally the weight is all down with the males, a fleet of baritones especially. Hampson’s voice is too light for Boccanegra, I think, and last night he sounded notably strained, barking rather than colouring. Though he looks a dashing pirate-Doge (pictured above right), he evoked little sense of the insecure schemer with blood on his hands. He is rather too nice. He did bring real pathos with the last scenes, but I kept thinking that Platanias, a squat, powerful Paolo with more intensity to his voice, might make out a more arresting Boccanegra.Above, Russell Thomas, Ferruccio Furlanetto, Dimitri PlataniasRising above all (or perhaps under) was the mighty bass-baritone Ferruccio Furlanetto as Fiesco, whose torn feelings about his granddaughter Amelia and the father she loves but whom he hates, Boccanegra, leads to the splendid dual scene where Fiesco and a dying Boccanegra reconcile.Furlanetto’s deep, oaken voice has acquired the crusts and cracks of antiquity, but he still wields it with great expressivity and ease in these sere veteran male roles that were Verdi’s gift to low voices. You follow his thoughts even when he’s silent - the mark of a great stage artist.As Amelia’s lover Adorno, Russell Thomas has an outstandingly clean, stentorian tenor tone but an entirely robotic way of occupying the stage, and in the absence of having any idea how he should move around, he has some old-fashioned tenor ways of grabbing audience attention, decibels mostly. I have no idea why he thinks it works that he sings to his lover that she must lower her voice or people will hear, and then stands 20 ft away from her to belt out his passion at her, before approaching her with all the ardour of a Dalek. He can sing all right but he lacks nuance.Although Gerzmava also shows a preference for static acting, her voice does so much that it hardly matters. This is an unusually iridescent soprano voice for a Moscow girl (she's with the Stanislavsky), with luscious Italianate tone, full and velvety when she wants, of bell-like clarity in the high register, but also able to deploy a plangent vibrato. Her black hair and plain black dress in the council chamber cut a reproving, modest figure among the opulent reds and golds of the men, as did the feathery way she quietly gentled the combative males with the softest of high trills.She’s the gleam in this cast, but so too is conductor Antonio Pappano, who launches the balmy Mediterranean stirrings of the overture with the same love with which he whips the singers into the emotional typhoons, beckoning orchestral details brightly into the drama, the happiest of captains urging on a slightly staid Verdi galleon.Find @ismeneb on Twitter",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/simon-boccanegra-royal-opera,3
514,"Les Pêcheurs de Perles, Opera Holland Park",Les Pêcheurs de Perles,Opera Holland Park,2013-06-26,alexandra Coghlan,"Bizet’s Les pêcheurs de perles is an unfashionably generous indulgence of a score tethered to an unfashionable and unredeemable plot. There’s not a contemporary director alive who can make the wretched thing work, so perhaps it would be better if we all just accepted this and closed our eyes through a Covent Garden revival from the 1980s with some of the finest voices in the business. It certainly gives everything to singers and orchestra that it so cruelly takes away from any director, but sadly the opera’s own faults do tend to end up at the door of those who attempt it anyway.Opera Holland Park’s Oliver Platt may not be altogether to blame for the dramatic woes of London’s latest production, but he’s not altogether innocent either. For a start he has a rather naïve faith in the dramatic power of inanimate objects. So laboriously raised and lowered, angled and stretched, is the giant orange tarpaulin that forms the better part of the opera’s set, that it deserves a place on the cast list. At any moment of tension or emotion, where focus might natural fall to the principals, you reliably find your attention drawn to the chorus, fiddling and fussing over some prop or other. If you’re so embarrassed by the Orientalist action of the show then choose not to direct it, don’t attempt an elaborate and extended game of theatrical misdirection.Misdirection is certainly something the chorus are suffering from, hamming things up unforgivably (though it doesn’t help that designer Colin Richmond seems to place most of the women in one of the more bohemian chapters of the WI, in a symphony of pond-coloured jumpers and skirts) and finding only an echo of the usual vocal strength of this young group. It’s a shame because Bizet’s ensemble-writing really is the best bit, and the excellent playing of the musicians of the City of London Symphonia deserves better.Conductor Matthew Waldren directs an efficient reading, getting lovely clarity from the strings and some beautifully blended work from the horns, and musically this is an enjoyable evening. After a rather tight start soprano Soula Parassidis (Leila, pictured above with Jung Soo Yun's Nadir) released a pleasingly lyrical and rounded tone in her middle register. She found extra force and richness at the top too as the night progressed, outdoing both her suitors. Given how light it is, though, it's not the most agile of voices, and I'd be interested to hear her negotiate something a little swifter and more detailed.Despite a spectacular crack early on, Grant Doyle’s Zurga (pictured left, to the right) was solid and carefully inflected, bringing an older, softer colour to this rivalry than we sometimes see. His “L'orage est calmé” was nicely underplayed, bringing the evening as close to truthful emotion as it managed, and he acquitted himself honourably in “Au fond du temple saint”. I suspect Jung Soo Yun’s Nadir will divide audiences rather more. His is a pleasant, open voice, and if a little soft-grained at times against Bizet’s heavy-hitting orchestral forces is certainly never pinched. He gives a very likeable, if not entirely developed, performance, and climactic moments do reveal that he does have the vocal weight when working at full capacity. He coped well with the falsetto passages, even in the tricky acoustic of the OHP tent which offers very little cover.There were just too many lazy slips, too little love put into this new production to get really excited about it. Directors working at Opera Holland Park are faced with a choice: either chafe dramatically against the façade of Holland House that forms the stage’s backdrop, work with it, or remove it from the equation. You can’t just ignore it, because when a chorus of Sri Lankan fishermen enter through an ornate 17th-century portico naturalism, however non-specific, does rather go out of the window.It’s a shame, because this is just the kind of opera that should work so well in this most relaxed of England’s summer opera experiences. Perhaps things will evolve as the run progresses, perhaps details will be fixed. Meantime it’s a show worth hearing, but if you happen to leave your glasses at home it wouldn’t be too much of a tragedy.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/les-p%C3%AAcheurs-de-perles-opera-holland-park,2
515,"BBC Cardiff Singer of the World Competition 2013 Final, BBC Four",BBC Cardiff Singer of the World Competition 2013 Final,BBC Four,2013-06-24,David Nice,"Once in a blue moon, the judges would seem to have got it wrong.  I can think only of 2001, when stunning Latvian mezzo Elina Garanča failed to win the coveted goblet but has since gone on to deserved fame as one of the top half-dozen singers on the international stage today. This year, though, it was business as usual: the panel lit up by a gracious Dame Kiri, three of the singers who didn’t make it to the final,sound telly opera trouper Mary King and I all agreed that regal American with a twinkle Jamie Barton deserved the palm.How so, given that all five finalists – not to mention the winner of the Dame Joan Sutherland Audience Prize, tried and tested English tenor Ben Johnson – would grace any opera house in the world with at least one of the characters whose arias they adopted? As declared several times in the course of the evening, it’s about the total package: personality, technique, communication, conjuring the world of each given opera in a couple of minutes. And, for that matter, choosing for the final a sequence of strong contrasts, though the judging is made over the course of a week which those of us Britten-tied, amongst other things, had reluctantly foregone.Small mistakes shouldn’t matter, but Barton was the only singer not to put a foot, or a note, wrong last night. The minute she opened her mouth as the fiery, melodramatic Principessa di Bouillon, love rival of Cilea’s Adriana Lecouvreur, you could feel not only the throb but also the quality of the velvet mezzo voice. Dio mio, thought I, a singer who could step into the shoes of Met regular Stephanie Blythe or mezzo-cum-soprano Violeta Urmana at a moment’s notice.Cilea’s gran scena gave Barton the chance to run the Italianate gamut from jealousy to rapture; Humperdinck’s Witch encouraged the twinkle and a fair bit of lip-smacking at her own plump expense; Sibelius’s opportunity for expansiveness in that wonderful song ""Was that a dream?"" allowed her to lay down a rich Nordic carpet of sound; and nothing was to go deeper all evening than the bittersweet farewell of Berlioz’s Dido. What was commenter and first competition wonder-winner Karita Mattila going on about, missing colours in the voice and complaining about shallowness of expression? It wasn’t the last time in the evening that the Finn raised my fellow spectators’ eyebrows at home with some odd dismissals of the feminine talent on show.She went wild, though, for the only male finalist, Croatian bass-baritone Marko Mimica (pictured above) as Verdi’s Attila, all man and, agreed, quite a sound. But no-one was allowed a critical word of his lumpen Figaro Act Four aria – not a number to choose out of context, or if you haven’t been working on the Italian, say, over six weeks at Glyndebourne. He should have inserted a German number into the Italian sequence, too. Soprano Teresa Romano had the Callas manner but slightly generalized Latin passion, and Mary King was right to point out that you don’t tackle Leonora’s ""Pace, mio dio"" from La forza del destino if you don’t yet have the technique to float a pianissimo top B flat. Yet lirico spinto sopranos are not in such plentiful supply that Romano would be turned away at the Royal Opera, where I’ve seen lesser would-be divas on stage.I'd have been perfectly happy to see either of the other two win. Argentinian Daniela Mack (pictured left) was a mezzo of quite another sort to Barton, who won't be tackling Mack's Rossini heroines or Mozart trouser roles. A more natural actress than Romano, and looking gorgeous with her big, expressive brown eyes – glamour does matter in these events – Mack contrasted the suicidal determination of Massenet’s Sapho, the palpitating bewilderment of Mozart’s Idamante at his father’s rejection and the can-I-believe-it happiness of Rossini’s Cenerentola. All were sung with perfect intensity, but I’d have liked the option of a whitened tone once or twice and not all the coloratura runs in Cinders’ ""Non piu mesta"" were flawless, though she made interesting decorative choices. I look forward to seeing her on stage, though, as Strauss’s Octavian or Composer.Similarly, elfish looking Ukrainian soprano Olena Tokar (pictured below) will travel the world giving her ideally strange Rusalka, as a seamless Hymn to the Moon demonstrated. What was Mattila on about, claiming to know better Czech than her Slavic junior? And was Tokar’s Musetta really too lightweight, as Mattila claimed ? I heard a total change of tone colour as she moved from Pamina’s ""Ach ich fühl’s"" – again, one top-note snag, slighter than Romano’s - to the Puccini, where musicianship and dramatic instinct seemed flawless.Tokar and Barton were especially lucky with the likeable responsiveness of Jun Mӓrkl, one of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales’s two conductors; the other, Graham Jenkins, seemed less interested in rapport.  Of the talking heads, King managed to say the most of significance in the shortest amount of time. Petroc Trelawny’s presentation was professional and low key, letting the women do most of the talking without imposing his own views. And while Glyndebourne chatelaine and hyper-communicative soprano Danielle de Niese didn’t get to ask backstage questions any more penetrating than those of the demoted Josie d’Arby  - usually “how do you feel?” and “what would it be like to win?”, which elicited equally bland replies from the contestants - at least she knows her stuff.You certainly believed her and Petroc about what a good time everyone had been having and how supportive the Cardiff audience was. As for Mattila, more snarky than seemed healthy for balance in her criticisms, well, you can’t win them all. The last image, of Barton holding her enraptured poise as all assembled sang “Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau” – that’s “Land of Our Fathers” to non Welsh speakers -  was as emotive as any of the many high spots in a very classy evening’s entertainment.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/bbc-cardiff-singer-world-competition-2013-final-bbc-four,4
516,"The Ring, Longborough Festival",The Ring,Longborough Festival,2013-06-24,stephen Walsh,"""This,"" Lizzie Graham writes in the programme book of the current Longborough Festival, “is definitely the test of whether or not it is possible to put on a convincing Ring in a small, privately-owned country theatre.” I don’t think Lizzie or her husband, Martin, the festival’s founders and owners of the theatre, can have seriously doubted that the answer would be yes. Serious doubts seem not to be part of their entrepreneurial make-up; or if they are, they suppress them. But the noisy acclaim of the far from provincial or rustic audience at the end of Götterdämmerung on Saturday must all the same have been music to their ears. The cycle had been not just convincing but, beyond question, a huge triumph, demolishing at a stroke all kinds of prejudice about Wagnerian scale, the Wagnerian orchestra, even the Wagnerian voice.Longborough’s 500-seat converted-barn theatre with its modest pit (70 players maximum) is not quite what you would think of designing for a 15-hour cycle with a cast of 50 and an orchestra of 110. But numbers can be deceptive. Gotthold Lessing’s reduced orchestral version of The Ring, made in the 1940s for small provincial German theatres, fits Longborough like a glove, mainly because it allows (though it doesn’t specify) a reduction of Wagner’s large string section – frankly unnecessary in a theatre this size.Just occasionally in Götterdämmerung and in the third act of Siegfried one misses the sheer weight of sonority that Wagner, in his late style, seems to be wanting. But hardly anything of the colour and variety, even richness, of his orchestration is lost in the superb playing of the festival’s orchestra under Anthony Negus. One of Negus’s assistants told me that the pit goes back so far that the woodwind sections, far under the stage, are sometimes practically inaudible to the singers. The balance for the audience, though, was consistently excellent – a rarity in Wagner; and as for any problems of pit-to-stage coordination, I detected none.On the other hand there are positive gains in terms of scale. The fact that the audience is so comparatively close to the stage means that refinements of gesture and facial expression come into play to an extent almost unknown in the bigger houses that usually perform Wagner. This is a major factor with Rachel Nicholls’s Brünnhilde, a truly great performance that humanizes this character to a degree unknown in my experience before her own début in the role last year, without in the least diminishing its epic force.My impression is that Nicholls’s voice, bred in baroque and classical music, has expanded since 2012 and acquired a more brilliant top. It remains, though, an instrument under nearly perfect control, with none of the squalling and squawking that Wagner sopranos like to use in their running battle with the orchestra. Nicholls, as I noted last year, sings this music with the precision and musicality, if not always the verbal clarity, of a lieder-singer. I wondered last year whether she would ever manage it in a large theatre. I now believe she would.Before last week, I had seen only the Siegfried and Götterdämmerung of Alan Privett’s production. In some ways Das Rheingold – musically the least rangy of the four operas – is the trickiest to stage in a small house. More than its successors, it depends heavily on movement, magic and illusion, and it can’t be said that Privett solves this problem with his permanent trio of visible, black-tighted stagehand actresses, who lift a black cloth to vanish Alberich or turn him into a nonexistent giant snake, or with his helplessly arm-waving Rhinemaidens, inertly defending the swirl of reddish-gold fabric, alias the Rhinegold, that Alberich pinches without serious opposition.Things liven up sharply with the entry of Mark Le Brocq’s vibrantly physical Loge (pictured above by John Alexander) in the second scene. Le Brocq, as well as being a fine lyrical singer, is another performer, like Nicholls, who understands the virtues of facial expression and quick, reactive gesture, which he uses like a television actor, assuming an attentive close camera. Perhaps he even overdoes it now and then; or is it just the rather static environment that makes it seem that way?Continued overleafPrivett himself seems much happier with Die Walküre, the most intimate panel of the tetralogy, and the one that depends most on richly evolved dialogue between pairs of characters. Suddenly there is movement and chemistry: a beautifully poised Sieglinde in Lee Bissett (already a touching, interesting Freia in Rheingold), and a splendiferous Siegmund in Andrew Rees (pictured below together by Matthew Williams-Ellis), who, however, perhaps let rip a shade too much in the early scenes and ran into vocal problems thereafter. The second act confrontations are riveting. Jason Howard’s Wotan, rather inhibited in Rheingold, blooms both vocally and psychologically in his third-degree with Alison Kettlewell’s magnificent Fricka, a portrait finely touched in with the ironic smiles and cutting gestures of the subservient, controlling wife. Then come Wotan and Brünnhilde, Brünnhilde and Siegmund, and in the final act the long farewell scene, Howard and Nicholls wonderfully interactive, the whole act – including a stunning team of Valkyries arriving from boxes and galleries, too many for individual praise - immaculately paced by Negus and subtly lit, like much of the production, by Ben Ormerod.Since 2011 Privett has made changes to Siegfried, and a few, I think, to Götterdämmerung. Fafner (the dark-voiced Julian Close) no longer trundles in on a cherry-picker, but hides behind a trio of sinister spot-lamps, then dies in his human shape: a distinct improvement. But the scene here and elsewhere is cluttered: gantries and scaffoldings that say nothing and block up the stage. As before, no leaf or blade of grass picks up the music’s insistence that we are in a forest; only the Woodbird, sparklingly sung and fluttered by Gail Pearson, survives of the Wagnerian flora and fauna.Mime, Siegfried and Alberich are double-cast. In Rheingold Richard Roberts is presumably standing in as Mime for Adrian Thompson in the first two cycles (of the three), but does so skilfully and with a certain malicious charm. In the dwarf’s much bigger Siegfried role, Thompson sheds the playfulness in favour of a rampant malevolence barely concealed by smarmy amiability, while catching the trace of poetry Wagner found in the poor little trickster. This is an excellent musical portrait. By contrast Malcolm Rivers, the Alberich here and in Götterdämmerung, has less vocal warmth than his Rheingold opposite number, Andrew Greenan (he is, after all, in his late seventies), but compensates with superb projection and a vivid presence, shuffling and scowling, and spitting out his words like cherry stones.Longborough have found a pair of more than adequate Siegfrieds. Hugo Mallet (in Siegfried itself) showed signs of under-preparation: he missed a couple of entries and once or twice needed prompting. But he sang with ease and clarity, moved well, and has the inestimable virtue, in this part, of looking like a descendant of the Master himself. In Götterdämmerung  Jonathan Stoughton seems entirely secure in the part: no blond Aryan, this Siegfried, but a dark, smiley, randy Hollywood star, all hands and eyelashes when he meets Gutrune, the innocent small-town boy not showing much sign of the wisdom Brünnhilde claims to have bestowed on him. The voice is strong and bright, but apt to lose colour in the softer middle register. On the whole it’s a reading that draws out the main weakness of Wagner’s central idea: the image of the Greatest Hero as not much more than a tough cowboy who don’t scare easy but gits nervous with the ladies.This is not a Ring of strong or alienating concepts. We are mainly in an ill-defined mythic epoch until Götterdämmerung, where for some reason the Gibichungs turn up in lounge suits and dresses or, in Hagen’s case, a snazzy brown housecoat (pictured left in mauve light by Matthews-Ellis: Stoughton, Pendred, Wade). They even go hunting in this kit, a limitation of wardrobe that perhaps explains Gunther’s poor standing along the Rhine. The castings, though, are strong, as last year. Eddie Wade is excellent as the weak, indecisive Gunther, who affects a wheel-chair to excuse his avoidance of heroic action; Stuart Pendred is good as the half-caste Hagen, though the voice, admirably focused in general, doesn’t always carry well from upstage; Lee Bissett is again lovely as Gutrune, a third portrait for her finely-differentiated gallery.Who does that leave? Three superb Rhinemaidens (Gail Pearson, Sara Wallander-Ross and Catherine King); three amazingly mellifluous Norns (Wallander-Ross, King and Meta Powell) perched ten feet up on their cherry-pickers – one of designer Kjell Torriset’s most striking images.  Some memorable individual vignettes: Geoffrey Moses’s pale, sentimental Fasolt, Julian Tovey’s fine, no-nonsense Donner, Stephen Rooke, a Froh who for two minutes sings like the fourth tenor, Mark Richardson’s perfectly unrefined Hunding. Phillip Joll returns as the Wanderer, but the voice is losing focus and clouds the solemnity of the musical line, notwithstanding the authority of his presence.But perhaps the most telling memory will be of Anthony Negus, the brilliant Svengali of this whole extraordinary week, crowding the stage at the final curtain, not only with the singers, but with everybody else in the company, down (or up?) to the tea-ladies, who has had any involvement in making the event what it is. It was a nice touch, and one that precisely reflected the range, as well as the scale, of Longborough’s achievement.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/ring-longborough-festival,4
517,"Gloriana, Royal Opera",Gloriana,Royal Opera,2013-06-21,David Nice,"Britten’s coronation opera, paying homage less to our own ambiguous queen than to the private-public tapestries of Verdi’s Aida and Don Carlo, is not the rarity publicity would have you believe, at least in its homeland. English National Opera successfully rehabilitated it in the 1980s, with Sarah Walker resplendent as regent. Phyllida Lloyd’s much revived Opera North production gave Josephine Barstow the role of a lifetime, enshrined in an amazing if selective film. The real questions, then, were why choosy visionary Richard Jones agreed to stage Gloriana, and whether he would have fun at its expense or sympathy for its dark soul.With Jones, though, it’s not a case of ""either..or"" but ""both"". His picture book fairy tales have a habit of turning the stomach and getting under the skin. Think of his Hänsel und Gretel, Anna Nicole, Pelléas et Mélisande: the list is endless but the productions never tell the same story. This one takes an institute pageant of 1953 – the director, incidentally, was born a day before the opera's world premiere that year – as both its starting point and its dramatically transfigured end, realised with such fantastical affection that there’s no hint of sarcastic parody. From before the first bars of music which Jones sets with such a careful ear to after the last, the staging is note perfect.A local mayor takes the young queen to inspect the stage, a horde of little boys hold up word boards to set the scene, and we’re off – with a regal parade from Windsors back to Tudors immaculately choreographed to every bar of Britten’s tournament fanfares, sallies and tattoos. The lights sometimes blind us, as they did in Jones’s parallel Young Vic Ibsen staging. Everyone is perfectly introduced with am-dram gestures writ reassuringly large: the envious Earl of Essex (Toby Spence, back in top voice after a serious illness as the very best and fullest of Britten tenors), his rival for an hour Mountjoy (Mark Stone), supercilious Raleigh (forthright bass Clive Bayley) and good queen Bess whose every word is sycophantically approved by the chorus and who rides off with her reconciled bucks in a floral state coach (pictured above)The other most rigidly formal public scene of the Royal Opera’s first half, the masque in Norwich, also passes with pleasant pomp. A giant vegetable display fits with the courtly theme of England’s fecundity; Britten’s potentially anodyne choral dances are complemented by Lucy Burge’s choreographic homage to an Ashton Pas de Deux. This is the ""green"" movement of Mimi Jordan Sherin’s lighting and Ultz’s gaudy designs, both of which are not so much painterly as symphonic, so fluidly do they move with Jones’s changes of inflection.Between the ensembles, Susan Bullock’s Gloriana and Spence’s plaything champing at the bit (pictured left) move downstage for the limelight – which means in to the enchanted air of the Second Lute Song, transporting both into a private world. We’re not allowed to forget the convention of a harpist for the lute, placed “offstage” left just as later a player in the wings doubles a Ballad Seller’s gittern and antiphonal bell ringers mark the city crier’s proclamations. Balcony bands of trumpeters and woodwind are properly, and excitingly, part of the action.Private and public begin to merge in the Whitehall ball scene, where professional dancers may leap highest in the Lavolta but the singers, Spence especially, are well up to their stylish level. Bullock’s Gloriana seems to be losing the plot as she ludicrously struts in Lady Essex’s stolen, ill-fitting finery.Britten tells us that the air has soured when Essex should be more wary of getting what he wants – the post of Lord Deputy to quell the Irish rebellion. A pall spreads upwards from Paul Daniel and the Royal Opera Orchestra, who always seem to have the perfect audience-stilling instincts for the moments of gravity (some of the more brilliant introductions still need a bit of ensemble work). Essex is left alone like a child dwarfed by the great throne of state (pictured above). It's a huge part of Spence's success in characterisation that his boyishness mitigates the rank ambition of the silly Earl.The auguries are good, then, for a Third Act which needs to grasp the nettle of Britten’s sudden seriousness as his Gloriana becomes a cross between duty-stricken Captain Vere in the previous masterpiece, Billy Budd, and the domineering Governess of the chamber opera still to come in the 1950s, The Turn of the Screw. The shock of the failed Essex’s intrusion on the queen without her wig (pictured above) is bound to kick start a new level of action. Bullock, up to this point only asked to be regal, stagily capricious and secure in ringing authority – which she is, with the exception of a slightly murky zone in the lower-middle register, toll of all those Brünnhildes she’s had to sing – ratchets up the intensity.It’s now clear that the Queen is the one real person in the pageant, limping and pacing arthritically outside its neat boundaries. Britten’s sombrely scored echoes of the happier Act One duet are reinforced by identical stage positions - Essex now slumped rather than lute-strumming against the table as the tired Elizabeth takes up her place in front of the institute proscenium to admit total failure. We’re on the edge of our seats.The show still goes on. Glimpses of stage management in the odd scene where a blind Ballad Singer, perfectly pitched a note below hammy by the refulgent Brindley Sherratt, describes the quick failure of Essex’s London rebellion keep this tricky intermezzo sharp and weird. Then all eyes are on the Queen’s dilemma.Male courtiers close in to persuade her to sign the rebel’s death warrant; humanity belongs to the women in the exchanges with Patricia Bardon’s stylish and sympathetic Lady Essex, whose pleas for her children (pictured left) re-engage the woman in Elizabeth, and Kate Royal’s not quite nervy-ambitious enough Penelope Rich, Essex's sister and Mountjoy's lover; for her to inflame the wavering regent, the battle of the high notes should be stronger than this. The men, though, are consistently strong, from baritone Jeremy Carpenter’s house debut as a suave Cecil to another Royal Opera novice, Britten tenor-in-waiting Andrew Tortise as the Spirit of the Masque.Ultimately, though, all focus is on what Bullock can do with the final scene of the Queen’s fading (pictured right) after Essex’s execution, to the shattering full-orchestral reprise of the Second Lute Song. Her declamation of historical texts is impressive, her shrivelling to a worn-out spider in the corner of the giant throne riveting.Above all, hers is a committed homage to Britten’s unique and unchallenged operatic setting of the English language (even if, as many have been too keen to point out, librettist William Plomer was no Auden). The highest glory, though, as acknowledged by first-night applause far from the begloved, bewildered politeness of the Royal Opera audience 60 years ago, belongs to Jones and his production team, battening down the hatches on backstage reality as the music and the dying queen, absolutely alone, concede defeat. That the final silent tableau of the reassembled cast greeting Her youthful Madge comes as no fatuous symmetry but as something rich and strange is all part of this production’s special magic. On its own unique terms, it puts not a single foot wrong - the crowning glory, perhaps, of quite a week for mighty Britten.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/gloriana-royal-opera,5
518,"Three Church Parables, Aurora Orchestra, Aldeburgh Festival",Three Church Parables,Aurora Orchestra,2013-06-19,Roderic Dunnett,"In Britten’s centenary the Aldeburgh Festival has come up with two mesmerising opera happenings. The innovation is to stage Peter Grimes on the town’s beach, a few hundred yards from the composer’s beachside Aldeburgh first home, amid a splurge of decaying fishing boats. The daring recreation is to present all three of his orchestrally bewitching 1960s Church Parables in their original setting, Orford Church, where Peter Pears famously created three roles: the distraught Madwoman in Curlew River, haughty Nebuchadnezzar in The Burning Fiery Furnace and The Tempter in The Prodigal Son. As an inspired decision, Aldeburgh drafted in The Opera Company’s Frederic Wake-Walker to direct all three with the equally ground-breaking company he founded, Mahogany Opera.To say that Wake-Walker has the brightest, boldest mind among Britain’s younger directors is an understatement. His knack of energising top-drawer lead singers (Glyndebourne, Buxton, Opera North), those of student age (an astonishing realisation of Stravinsky’s Renard in London’s East End), and schoolchildren alike (Wake-Walker’s staging of Hans Krása’s Brundibár - the Nazi-era Terezín ghetto opera - in Aldeburgh’s Jubilee Hall closely rivalled the original) marks him out as one of the most original and disciplined directors of our day.Here was a cast - led by the visually, as well as vocally, gifted tenor James Gilchrist - of young men (monks headed by a superlative bass Abbot, Lukas Jakobski), and boys, cowled novices who yield a brilliant floorshow, wiggling hands, legs and pelvises teasing out shockingly sensual shapes and gyrations. Kitty Callister’s furnace design (a layered series of stained glass shards) made a dazzling, breathtakingly apt climax. Ben Payne lights often from below, alternating eerily sinister and beauteous effects. The eight-man chorus not only mastered Britten’s unusually complex vocal lines and harmony, but every single stylised hand or body gesture had the intensity of a saintly medieval woodcut. Witness their aching sympathy for the old-young crone in Curlew River, culminating in the miraculous appearance, shadowed behind a raised sail (then revealed like a dove), of the white-clad boy’s soul (treble William Rose is at 13 already a proven high-class Aldeburgh performer). Witness the gross carousings in The Prodigal Son, or their sinuous mocking, topped by violent red attire, in The Burning Fiery Furnace, where another gifted boy treble, Lucas Evans, supplied the benedictory Angel.The most violent reds picked out Gilchrist’s creepy Nebuchadnezzar, oozing temporal excess, counterpointed by Jakobski’s glutinous Magus/Astrologer and Gilchrist’s Machiavellian plottings. Tenor John McMunn’s vulnerable Younger Son uplifted The Prodigal Son. Less gripping than the others but still riveting were the Aurora Orchestra’s young soloists (percussion, timps, low strings, orientalised flutes, horn above all) overseen by Roger Vignoles.Rodney Earl Clarke excelled as the Prodigal’s potentially murderous elder brother. Yet my money, vocally and dramatically, was on baritone Samuel Evans, singing the fascinating role of the Traveller in Curlew River. He put nary a foot wrong. Useful when wading in deep. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/three-church-parables-aurora-orchestra-aldeburgh-festival,5
519,"Peter Grimes, Aldeburgh Beach",Peter Grimes,Aldeburgh Beach,2013-06-18,Kimon Daltas,"First things first. There are limited tickets still available for this run of Peter Grimes on Aldeburgh beach but there won’t be for long, so move fast. You can read the rest of this review later; the next few minutes could make the difference between experiencing one of the most memorable performances of your life and just finding out what you’ve missed out on.In Britten’s centenary year, the Aldeburgh Festival wanted to do something a bit special with Grimes, so they set themselves a logistical mountain to climb, booked Tim Albery to direct, and proceeded to deliver on all fronts. The audience sits facing the sea, with the stage interposed. Half the audience sits on bleachers, with the rest on the shingle in front.The Britten-Pears Orchestra has been pre-recorded at the Snape concert performances a few days ago, and is played back through an array of speakers dotted around the seating areas. The soloists sing live into microphones, while the chorus sings live with a pre-recorded boost. It is remarkable that, despite a stiff breeze throughout the opening night’s performance, the sound was excellent and well balanced, with all elements, live and recorded, meshing seamlessly. The sound and lighting designers (Sound Intermedia and Lucy Carter respectively) deserve not mere plaudits, but awards, medals and knighthoods.The stage itself, designed by Leslie Travers, is a long uneven strip of rugged jetty, weathered fishing boats, steps and ladders, looking like the lair of an audacious beachcomber; the backdrop is the gradually dimming sky above the grey fractal infinity of the North Sea; a light mist whooshes through the beams of the spotlights. Everything fits and feels appropriate, mesmerizingly so, from the sound of shingle crunching underfoot as the drum-led posse in Act II marches away into the darkness, to the wind whipping through Grimes’ hair as he pushes his boat out to sea for the last time.Alan Oke (Grimes), Giselle Allen (Ellen Orford) and David Kempster (Balstrode) are the three main poles of the piece, and rise extremely well to the obvious challenges of the production. Grimes is often played as a more or less otherworldly character, detached, presumably, from the Borough even before things started going wrong. Oke instead goes normal, and his Grimes is just a fisherman, one of many. In many ways, it makes his tragedy seem more evitable, less of his own making. Every word he sings is intelligible (no surtitles, of course) and he hits the golden section of Britten interpretation: more song-like than operatic, more nuance and fragility than clanging projection.Ellen Orford’s quartet with Auntie (Gaynor Keeble) and the nieces (Alexandra Hutton, Charmian Bedford) is one of the highlights, a testament to the singers of course, but also a reminder that this opera contains some of Britten’s most wildly accomplished writing. The Chorus of Opera North combined with the Chorus of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama fulfil their duties with gusto, and form a very lively canvas for Leslie Travers’ costumes. A final word of advice: if you’re lucky enough to get a ticket, dress for winter.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/peter-grimes-aldeburgh-beach,5
520,"Death in Venice, English National Opera",Death in Venice,English National Opera,2013-06-16,ismene Brown,"Austere, beautiful, heartbreaking, streaked with genius - that goes for both Benjamin Britten’s last opera Death in Venice and Deborah Warner’s remarkable production of it for ENO, returning all too briefly to the Coliseum, with a superb central performance. Besiege the box office for one of the four remaining performances if you want to see contemporary operatic art refined to its most personal and powerful.The story is well-known from Thomas Mann’s novella and Luchino Visconti’s classic film: the downfall of a mature novelist who visits Venice to break his writer’s block, and there falls in love with a teenaged boy and contracts cholera. Both are fatal to him. The combination of illicit love and a shadowy sickness is peculiarly Venetian, but how to stage this most lavish of cities on a bare opera stage?By going even barer - and it’s fantastic. Warner’s six-year-old production indelibly captures Venice with a contradictory spareness. It’s almost all done in miraculous light and very sparse, sharp-edged scenery, moving across your vision as if seen in a zoëtrope. Projections of rippling water across a black wall, an unhealthily smoggy dawn over a flat sea, fluttering curtains for the Lido hotel (above), occasional poles and indistinct gondoliers - the physical setting is haunting, Tom Pye’s precise props backlit with Jean Kalman’s Apollonian lighting and a whiff of salt.What makes the visual staging emotionally gripping, as well as admirably picturesque, is its actual state of flux and movement: in the orchestral passages between singing, people pass before your eyes, scenery constantly moves in and out, flunkeys silently appear. You feel, from your seat, as if you are yourself one of the strollers, passing by this tragedy, looking over your shoulder at it as Von Aschenbach constantly cranes to stare at Tadzio, realising that you too are a voyeur, and your own judgment is in constant flux.This approach brilliantly succeeds for a work that is more of a private monologue than an opera of public events and actions. The libretto Britten got from Myfanwy Piper is highly unusual (Alan Bennett explored some thoughts about this in his entertaining play about Britten and Auden, The Habit of Art), and Piper’s sometimes prosy, lecturing style is turned by Warner into a positive asset. She presents Von Aschenbach as a man entirely split within himself, giving us his version, pleading directly to us (as a jury on his actions) in mitigation for his abandonment of his own high standards, losing control of his trusty brains, humiliating himself.The character's attraction towards the boy is famously hard to pitch and John Graham-Hall's assumption is magnetic, the eroticism smudged and ambiguous. He appears a thin, sandy, dry-skinned academic, proud of his reputation, pursing his lips in self-protection, smoking incessantly, evidently a man alone and easily self-embarrassed  (pictured right).He shows a remarkable command of body language. He adopts a hesitant swagger as he tells us of his willingness to experiment with life, then suddenly touches his mouth furtively as he draws on his cigarette, as if imagining a kiss. It would be an extraordinary performance just in physical terms, a Petrushka collapsing under a weight of sensual experience he is unprepared for, even if Graham-Hall were not also making his voice so subtly suited to his character's indecisiveness, mixing overtones of Bach's Evangelist, castrato and sometimes disconcertingly operatic tenor.Graham-Hall also convinces in implying that the whole show is in Von Aschenbach’s mind, these pictures of travels, hotels, beaches, are his imaginings, his dreams, his novel - so that the tricky scene where the gods Apollo and Dionysus have their pompous interchange over his sleeping body and soul obtain a credibility: this man dreams like this, he really does.So one comes to read his fixation on this vital, silent boy not so much as an illicit sexual urge as his wish-fulfilment for his own past life to have been different, not just written solitarily on the page, but experienced in rousing games on beaches with others. It is deeply pathetic, and perfectly judged.Britten was, of course, a master-painter of the soul's high seas, and even the barometric atmosphere seems to quiver through the strings, or a clammy pulse through stuttering clarinet dissonances. Edward Gardner’s conducting of the ENO orchestra is faultlessly responsive and responsible, making the intentionally wide instrumentation and styles converge in imagination, the piquant gamelan of the boys and rambling intellectual piano for Von Aschenbach, the sparse female presence and the rudely assertive male pimps, all echoing the Apollo/Dionysus theme in a most sensuous, poignant way.The dances for the boy Tadzio and his friends are choreographed by Kim Brandstrup with an affecting combination of everyday vigour and soaring acrobatics. Young Sam Zaldivar is curly-haired and Greek-looking as per the libretto, able to pull off nonchalant no-hands cartwheels as well as a hallucinatory final solo as Aschenbach dies, seraphically turning graceful arabesques in silhouette against the fading sun. It fits into the whole, it vanishes in a perfect beauty into an exceptional production.Andrew Shore (left, as Dionysus) is a masterful character singer who is variously sinister, insinuating, wheedling, corrupting and warning in his shape-shifting incarnations; Anna Dennis and Marcus Farnsworth also impress as the strawberry-seller and the English clerk. The evening is profoundly moving, and a masterpiece of contemporary theatrical production in Britten's centenary year.Find @ismeneb on Twitter ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/death-venice-english-national-opera,5
521,"The Importance of Being Earnest, Linbury Studio Theatre",The Importance of Being Earnest,Linbury Studio Theatre,2013-06-15,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"If you were new to contemporary opera, you might think it was forbidden for modern works to be funny. Tragedy is still the default setting for major commissions. You only get serious money if you have serious thoughts and serious music, it seems. At the Royal Opera, the policy is to stage unfunny, ancient buffas on the main stage and sharp, modern ones in the Linbury Studio Theatre. Gerald Barry’s The Importance of Being Earnest is the latest.The concert premiere last year was as close to an overnight smash hit as it is possible to get in opera. The three-act adaptation was snapped up by several opera companies. Keen to keep its finger on the pulse, the Royal Opera rushed in before everyone else with last night's UK premiere staging.But was it done in too much of a rush? The great thing about this opera is the tension between the polished perfection of Wilde's original words and the incontinent insanities of Barry's score. At the end of Act II - in a scene that has already entered operatic folklore - Barry’s music starts to behave quite literally like a bull in a china shop, careering through the verbal topiary with pistols, loudspeakers, giant mallets and smashing plates.It is a madcap tomfoolery that works only if Wilde's words are played dead straight. Edwardian straight. By default, this is what we got from the nicely stiff concert performance at the Barbican. At the Linbury Studio Theatre, director Ramin Gray plunged us into a mildly surreal version of the present day, characters emerging and returning from the audience in everyman clothes, acting out on a pretty bald stage (save the orchestra). Without a frigid, period foil, the dislocations offered by Barry were dissipated amid Gray’s own absurdist offerings.All of which might have been fine if Gray had delivered anything fresh or sharp. Instead we got stale and blurry. The fact is that you present a routine of silly walks or éclair-face-stuffing at you peril. We’ve seen these sketches done before – and better. The cast wasn't bad. There was some fun deranged mugging from Hilary Summers’ scene-stealing Miss Prism. And Alan Ewing was as brilliant as ever as the Kraut-loving, closet Fascist (in Barry's imagination) Lady Bracknell. There was something a bit Keeping Up Appearances about the rest of the acting, though, from Paul Curievici (John Worthing), Benedict Nelson (Algernon), Geoffrey Dolton (Reverend Chasuble) and Stephanie Marshall (Gwendolen). Marshall redeemed herself in a wonderful Princess Di turn behind the loudspeaker. Ida Falk Winland (Cecily) was piercingly good throughout.None of the strange games from Gray or from lighting designer Franz Peter David (who provided pretty but hyperactive dislocations of his own) could match what was going on in the music. Here, the Britten Sinfonia, conducted with spirit by Tim Murray and rewarded with a staged presence, were presenting a skit of their own. Scales, more gin-and-tonic than diatonic, hurtled and hocketed around the ensemble and through the voices of the cast, with little or no regard for comfort or range. Chunks of Beethoven's Ninth appeared as if they'd been shoved through a mincer. Along the way we visited demented arrangements of Auld Lang Syne, a French revolutionay song and Schiller’s Ode to Joy. Wildeans will be upset. Most of the carefully crafted exchanges are mangled, musical comedy substituting the verbal wit. But if comedy is about pushing wrongness beyond the point at which it is forgivable or acceptable, Barry’s opera must be considered a masterpiece. By wanting to be first rather than the best, however, the Royal Opera appear to have cut corners. Barry deserves better.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/importance-being-earnest-linbury-studio-theatre,3
522,"Le nozze di Figaro, Glyndebourne Festival Opera",Le nozze di Figaro,Glyndebourne Festival Opera,2013-06-09,stephen Walsh,"The Marriage of Figaro is so much a part of Glyndebourne’s history that it’s sometimes hard to recall the details of this or that production. Michael Grandage’s current staging, though, will be easily remembered for its strong characteristics, both good and bad: for Christopher Oram’s marvellous Alhambra sets, for the brilliance and occasional vulgarity of Grandage’s direction, for its perfection of movement and timing and its almost total obliteration of the social distinctions on which the plot hinges. Saturday’s revival was a fine example of how a spectacular misconception can be validated by sheer dramatic conviction and musical excellence.Grandage updates to, I suppose, the swinging Seventies. The Almavivas roll on during the overture in a smart red coupé, the Count is a Richard Branson lookalike with too much hair and a range of Carnaby Street suitings, the Act 3 wedding dance is a jive-in that flickers on in the background of Act 4; we are in an egalitarian micro-climate with mere traces of ancien regime, as opposed to a social straitjacket coming apart at the seams.This could be ghastly but somehow isn’t, or at least only in passing. Why? Partly because the idea is internally consistent and more or less works on its own terms. Its failures are fleeting. The Count’s “Hai già vinto la causa” requires a grandeur that Joshua Hopkins is denied by the production, whether or not he has it at his own disposal. Cherubino’s passion for the Countess probably shouldn’t be consummated on her bedroom floor (Lydia Teuscher as Cherubino, pictured above).But the successes are more important. They start with the stage direction: sharp observation and crisp management from first scene to last. Some credit for this should go to the revival director, Ian Rutherford. This is a genuinely comic Figaro, but also a very touching one, and not only in the dénouement. Figaro’s garden duet with the disguised Susanna has a truth and precision, superbly conveyed by Adam Plachetka and Laura Tatulescu (pictured below), despite the absurdity of the situation (less than usual, though: Tatulescu’s disguise is almost too convincing); but even the recognition scene in Act 3, which is ludicrous even by the usual standards of opera buffa, touches some sentimental chord remote from the farcical deus ex machina spoof.Of course none of this would cut much ice without singing and acting of the quality we now happily take for granted at Glyndebourne. The cast, entirely new from last year (with one significant switch), has no serious weakness and is rich in talent fresh to these shores – an extraordinary tribute to the company’s talent-spotting flair. Tatulescu’s Susanna is outstanding, witty, personable, agile-voiced but able to flood with warmth at the right moment, which “Deh vieni” certainly is, even though its passion – so typically of Mozart – is spurious, fed by anger.The production’s original Susanna, Lydia Teuscher, is now Cherubino, a role often taken by mezzos, but here sparkling in the hands of a genuine soprano who can throw off a tremulous, high-speed “Non so più” as if it were the easiest thing in the world. His/her tendency to melt at every mention of the Countess is admittedly understandable when the lady in question is the willowy Amanda Majeski, irresistible even when briefly tested by her Act 2 coloratura, superb in “Porgi amor” and, especially, “Dove sono.”Perhaps the males are less utterly ideal. But the qualification is mild. I like Plachetka’s Figaro, floppy black hair and all, though his character loses some of its edge for lack of a worthy adversary in Hopkins’s Count – the fault, as already indicated, of the production. Hopkins actually sings stylishly and got an ovation (a shade unexpectedly) for his aria. Luciano Di Pasquale is a tubby, likeable Bartolo – no mean feat (the likeability, that is), Timothy Robinson a smarmy schoolmaster Basilio, Anne Mason a sharp-tongued Marcellina sadly deprived of her final-act aria. Basilio loses his as well, but that we can survive. Sara Lian Owen, from the Glyndebourne chorus, is a sweet, cheeky Barbarina, who makes the most of her tiny, soulful song about the lost pin.The conductor Jérémie Rhorer, a period specialist confronted by the modern London Philharmonic Orchestra, comes through with flying colours, often at tempi that some will find on the quick side, now and then punctuating Mozart with unexpected rubatos and fermatas, but always alert to his singers’ needs, and with a sure hand on the orchestra. Gareth Hancock supplies immaculate, stylish keyboard continuo.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/le-nozze-di-figaro-glyndebourne-festival-opera-0,4
523,"Die Entführung aus dem Serail, Garsington Opera",Die Entführung aus dem Serail,Garsington Opera,2013-06-08,Kimon Daltas,"In sunshineand bright blue skies there can be few places more green and pleasant than Wormsley Park. Garsington Opera has found a happy home there, with this being its third season in its sleekly rectilinear big top at the Getty family’s Buckinghamshire estate.Daniel Slater, the director of this production of Die Entführung, has taken all sorts of witty liberties with the libretto – at least the spoken part – and brought the story right up to date. Selim is an expatriate Russian oligarch and proud owner of a football club. Osmin is his black-suited chief henchman. Pedrillo is a cockney wide-boy sportswriter. Belmonte (Monty for short) is his American university friend. Konstanze is a Spanish It-girl. Blonde is her Swedish chum. And the chorus of Janissaries is a crowd of football supporters. Bravely, Slater has written an entire new script around the bones of the story but the silliness and topicality of the changes suit the spirit of the piece very well. It is dramatically incongruous that the set pieces are all sung in German but there have been far stiffer challenges to an operatic audience’s capacity to suspend disbelief, and overall Slater more than gets away with it.The staging is designed by Francis O’Connor with a real sense of humour and a great deal of imagination in getting round the difficulties of working without a proscenium arch and fly tower. Furniture rises out of the floor, things spin round to reveal other things, flaps open, stairs appear, an open-top Jag drives on (one of the landlord’s perhaps?). It’s all very amusing and the audience laps it up – I’ve never known a scene change to be applauded before – though all the excitement verges on the distracting at times, and one wonders if the singers occasionally felt upstaged by the staging.The quartet of lovers – young singers but not inexperienced – do a fantastic job. Both Rebecca Nelsen (Konstanze) and Susanna Andersson (Blonde) confidently power through their passages of fiendish coloratura, while the two tenors, Norman Reinhardt (Belmonte) and Mark Wilde (Pedrillo), have nicely matched soft-edged voices. Nelsen’s big Act II aria ought to have been a highlight but it was slightly marred by an excess of on-stage activity. The director ought to trust the audience to just sit and listen for a few minutes.The excellent Matthew Rose, playing Osmin – truculent, brutish, baleful – also handles himself well in a part with some very tricky moments, testing both his range and nimbleness. Aaron Neil’s Selim, though not a singing role, certainly deserves a mention for his billionaire swagger and for earning plenty of laughs. Conductor William Lacey, a Brit doing rather well mostly abroad, keeps a good pace, as well as offering sensitive and responsive accompaniment to the more dolorous moments. The orchestra does itself very proud.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/die-entf%C3%BChrung-aus-dem-serail-garsington-opera,4
524,"Wagner Dream, Welsh National Opera",Wagner Dream,Welsh National Opera,2013-06-07,stephen Walsh,"Those who knew the composer Jonathan Harvey, who died of motor neurone disease last December, will remember him as the least demonstrative, least theatrical of men. His presence was gentle, soft-spoken, essentially inward – the physical image of the Buddhism that came to dominate his spiritual consciousness in the latter half of his life. That so intensely pure-minded and modest a musician should have been fascinated by a genius as ostentatious and self-advertising as Wagner is one of those attractions of opposites that are the stuff of art. Whether or not Wagner Dream, Harvey’s final operatic working out of his obsession, is quite on its hero’s level might seem rather doubtful. But the comparison would be futile in any case. There is not all that much Wagnerian about Wagner Dream.The connection is through Wagner’s own Buddhism, or rather his somewhat theoretical interest in the subject (in life he was a meat-eating vegetarian and a love-hungry eugenicist). There is Buddhism in Tristan, Parsifal, even Götterdämmerung. But his most overt treatment was a brief sketch for a scenario about the Buddha called Die Sieger (The Victors), not a note of which was ever actually composed.Harvey co-opted this scenario and turned it into a music drama that Wagner is imagined as composing, in thought at least, on his deathbed. Struck down by a heart attack in his rented Venetian palazzo, he is assailed by a vision of his unwritten drama, whose acting out is in some not very clear sense seen as fulfilling his life’s purpose and enabling it to end on the right note for him to achieve what the buddha Vairochana calls his “final condition.”This action takes place, so to speak, on a higher plane, upstage  behind the orchestra, itself relocated by the director, Pierre Audi, in a temporary pit on the stage side of the footlights. Downstage, in front of the orchestra, Wagner suffers and dies, attended by his wife Cosima, the doctor, and the young English singer Carrie Pringle, all unaware of the Buddhist action and baffled by Wagner’s conversation with it. Harvey (pictured below) allots these “real-life” parts to speaking actors, playing here in German; the Sieger drama is sung in Pali, the language of the Buddha himself. The sense of distance, of unworldly remoteness, is total. The vocal setting of this almost-lost language kept reminding me of Stravinsky’s Abraham and Isaac, with its text in Hebrew, a language of which Stravinsky knew not one syllable but which he set with a haunting sense of its ritual significance.To describe in detail the many levels of Harvey’s score would take a much longer review than this. Both musically and dramaturgically the opera is a palimpsest: layer on layer, from Harvey’s own culminating work and death, down through Wagner’s, and on into the virtual world of the Buddha and the hidden reality of Schopenhauer’s noumenon, the profound truth which, he maintained, we can only ever glimpse through music.To achieve this “travel”, Harvey worked in the studios at IRCAM in Paris, and for once the electronics have a delicacy and a magically spaced-out quality (in both senses) that fully justify what has often in the past been little more than an arid concession to the god technology. But Harvey’s scoring for conventional instruments is no less exquisite, and only occasionally lapses into telly-ad tinkly orientalism. He applies different styles to the dramatic levels: a kind of frenzied modernism for the real-life elements, a more placid, lucid, but none the less angular manner for the human drama of the Sieger play, and an altogether simpler, more serene quasi-tonal line and harmony for the Buddha and his followers. The orchestral playing throughout seems immaculate.What I don’t find in this music is any very strong dramatic impulse. For a hundred minutes or so the work proceeds slowly towards its goal, with the odd flurry of activity, but without much audible variety of pacing, even when the admirably unobtrusive conductor, Nicholas Collon, seems to be waving his arms quite fast. The music’s activity is textural more than rhythmic, inward facing, self-communing. It’s the music of a reflective more than an athletic soul: a deep thinker with a fine ear but (perhaps) an underused body.Audi’s production (first seen in Luxembourg in 2007) is simple but multi-planed, subtly stage-managed, beautifully lit (by Jean Kalman): it matches and clarifies the music’s virtues to perfection. The different worlds come into sharp focus. Apart from the couch on which Wagner dies, there is no scenery, few props, yet the sense of time and locale is always exact, clinched by music, light and costume (Robby Duiveman). Thank heaven and Nirvana, there’s no risk here of a 1950s update.The cast could hardly be bettered. Claire Booth is superb as the young untouchable Pakati, who through her love for the monk Ananda (Robin Tritschler) persuades the Buddha (David Stout) to admit her to his order, previously closed to women. There is an obvious parallel here with The Magic Flute, and the same vocal contrast in the male roles, beautifully presented by these two singers. Richard Angas (pictured above) is impressive as the crotchety Old Brahmin, who naturally opposes this outrage against nature and tradition. Richard Wiegold is excellent as the stately Vairochana, Rebecca De Pont Davies no less so as Pakati’s vibrant, perhaps too youthful Mother, who is herself received along with her daughter.Inevitably the actors have the more thankless task: like the Pasha Selim in Mozart’s Seraglio, they can only stand amazed as the music flows past them and away from them. They do it, nevertheless, with panache: Gerhard Brössner as Wagner, Karin Giegerich as Cosima, Ulrike Sophie Rindermann as the unfortunate Carrie Pringle, the Flower Maiden remembered by history only as the likely cause of Wagner’s death. That’s one myth, among several, that Harvey reinvents.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/wagner-dream-welsh-national-opera,5
525,"Owen Wingrave, Guildhall School of Music",Owen Wingrave,Guildhall School of Music,2013-06-06,alexandra Coghlan,"Although originally commissioned by the Royal Opera House, Benjamin Britten’s opera Owen Wingrave was always intended to be an opera-for-television. Perhaps it’s this unusual pedigree that has scared off potential performances of this little-seen work, perhaps it’s the piece’s awkward drama and barely digested polemic. Either way it’s a shame. This late score is full of Brittenish melodic fragments and orchestral colours, and if the opera house wouldn’t exactly be the poorer for its absence the concert hall certainly would.Why the inherently naturalistic medium of television should have provoked Britten’s most stylized and unyielding drama is hard to fathom. Even the composer’s instinctive feel for word-setting and ear for dialogue deserts him in his dealings with Myfanwy Piper’s libretto. Based on a Henry James short story, the opera’s bluntly pacifist agenda finds plenty of ideological soapboxes from which to hector the audience in this Gothic tale about a locked room and a family curse.While The Turn of the Screw offered Britten all manner of shadowy psychological corners to explore, Owen Wingrave is too busy making its case to bother with much by way of character development or inner life, and it’s a thin set of paper dolls indeed that the students from the Guildhall’s opera course tackle in this new co-production with Canada's Banff Centre, directed by Kelly Robinson.In its favour are Madeleine Boyd’s attractive designs (though if the updating of war scenarios to Afghanistan had any effect beyond giving us desert camouflage instead of period uniforms it was lost on me). The whole premise just doesn’t translate to contemporary values, and even if we read (as some have insisted we should) war as a cipher for hetero-normality and pacifism as homosexuality, the extremity of the Wingrave family’s reactions just doesn’t ring true.Working against Boyd’s rather classic visuals is Robinson’s decision to stage the show in the traverse – a device that seemingly adds nothing a more classic presentation couldn’t have achieved, and leads inevitably to half the cast singing with their backs to you at any one moment. That may work just about for professionals, but for smaller student voices whose resonance isn’t yet fully focused it just means that words and sense in this already baffling tale are lost. Add to this a series of video screens, presumably paying homage to the work’s television origins, which distract more than they illuminate, and you have more hindrance than help for the cast.Fortunately there’s some excellent singing, notably from Catherine Backhouse’s powerful, unyielding Kate and Joseph Padfield (pictured above) as Owen’s senior officer Spencer Coyle. Backhouse’s mezzo offers wonderfully even shades all through the register, and her impassioned delivery brought dangerous warmth to James’ fanatical, cold-fish heroine. Coyle also brings depth to his tone (though not quite as finished a sound) that unfortunately shows up Benjamin Appl’s Owen’s limitations. Although sympathetic in performance, Appl (pictured below) simply doesn’t sing enough. We lose any sense of through-line or legato in his phrases, especially in the middle of the voice where it becomes unfocused and foggy.There’s good support from Roisin Walsh as the obligatory battleaxe-aunt and Raphaela Papadakis as Mrs Julian in what turns out to be an evening dominated by the women of the cast – surprising perhaps in an opera about the military, but Britten would surely have approved of such reverse emphasis.Although suffering in blend from being exiled to one end of the traverse and having to duet with some enthusiastic air-conditioning, the orchestra (using David Matthews’s reduced scoring) offers a many-textured reading under Dominic Wheeler. Lovely contributions from the harp echo the celesta from Britten’s earlier works and prefigures the gamelan-type sounds still to come in Death In Venice, and if single strings struggle a bit in this acoustic then that is through no fault of theirs.This is a production that takes a flawed opera and does almost everything possible to highlight its limitations. That being said, it’s a rare chance – most likely your only chance in this anniversary year – to hear this elegant miniature of a score, and thanks to some fine singing and playing it’s one worth going to hear, if not see.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/owen-wingrave-guildhall-school-music,3
526,"The Perfect American, English National Opera",The Perfect American,English National Opera,2013-06-02,Kimon Daltas,"There were a small but substantial number of children dotted around the auditorium at the opening night of The Perfect American, and one hopes they hadn’t been led to expect singalong-a-Disney, all bright colours and catchy tunes. The piece takes place in the last few months of Walt Disney’s life, as his diagnosis with late stage lung cancer prompts introspective angst about the meaning of his success and legacy, and the terrible contrast between his own mortality and the agelessness of his creations. The great man’s personal flaws are laid bare.Directed by Phelim McDermott – of Improbable Theatre Company – the production arrives at the ENO after an initial outing at the Teatro Real Madrid. The set, designed by Dan Potra, is an effective fusion of mechanical and digital. Two large camera cranes suspended from above circle each other, while the cameras themselves are projectors in disguise. Sketches on drafting paper spring into animated life, which, projected onto sheets of gauze, hang hologrammatically in the air. Due credit to Leo Warner (video designer) and Joseph Pierce (animation director) who provide much of the visual appeal of the production. Although no Disney characters appear, the spectre of Mickey is a frequent theme in the projections, represented simply by one large circle topped by two smaller ones.Phillip Glass has tended to be drawn to themes in which the theatre is psychological and meditative, and The Perfect American follows that pattern by offering little in the way of forward narrative momentum – the 13 scenes which make up the action may seek to illuminate aspects of Walt Disney’s life, but do not suggest anything like cause and effect. The libretto also occasionally seems to lack purpose, the dramatic necessity of some lengthily sung conversations being questionable, when not dipping into bathos (""I’m so cold; my jugular feels like an icicle"").Disney’s disdain for the employees who produce his art is a central theme. ""If I could only have my way, I would build a machine that would replace all of you"", he tells William Dantine, the disgruntled draughtsman who was fired for attempting to unionise. Dantine is the narrator of Peter Stephan Jungk's novel on which the opera is based. Here he is reduced to a peripheral role, though Donald Kaasch’s portrayal of Dantine’s gradual descent into embittered destitution is a highlight of the production.Walt himself is played by the masterful Christopher Purves, whose natural ease and presence make him a convincing tycoon. He is assisted by an ensemble cast who all pull their weight. John Easterlin’s brilliant turn as Andy Warhol at the beginning of Act II offers a dash of levity in the otherwise dark world of the opera, while Zachary James as the malfunctioning animatronic Abraham Lincoln (pictured above by Richard Hubert Smith) is at the centre of probably the most memorable scene, his brilliantly lurching motion presumably schooled by choreographer Ben Wright.Movement and dance are a large part of the production, with a troupe of dancers ably switching between the roles of faceless animators, nightmarish bunny rabbits and helpful stagehands. Elsewhere, the choreographed movement is less effective, as when at various points cast and chorus enact a rather stagey slow motion, the feeling being one of waiting for the music to catch up.Conductor Gareth Jones digs into Glass’s undulating textures and produces a very subtle and atmospheric performance. This is no showpiece for the orchestra, but it demands precision and commitment from the pit, and of this there is plenty. The overall result is a production with plenty of interest and moments of brilliance but one which it is, perhaps, a little difficult to warm to.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/perfect-american-english-national-opera,3
527,"I Puritani, Grange Park Opera",I Puritani,Grange Park Opera,2013-06-01,alexandra Coghlan,"Apparently Bellini’s I Puritani was Queen Victoria’s favourite opera. That wasn’t quite reason enough for director Stephen Langridge to condemn the cast of his new Grange Park production to this extraordinarily ugly sartorial era, but unfortunately he found his justification nonetheless – looking across the Channel to the scientific explorations and experiments of Paris’s notorious hospital la Salpêtrière.André Brouillet’s painting Une leçon clinique à la Salpêtrière sees a half-naked women slumped in a faint while all around her medical students, starched, wing-collared and suited to a man, look on with predatory professionalism at their specimen. This image is surely the idée fixe behind Langridge’s aggressive reworking of Bellini’s opera (pictured below), a meditation on the 19th century obsession with mental health and its dangerous implications for women.There is of course a mad scene or two for heroine Elvira in the original, along with some extended head-shaking and objectifying from her male friends and relations, but otherwise Bellini’s last opera seems to offer a singularly unhelpful basis for what might otherwise be an interesting concept. Lucia di Lammermoor, Anna Bolena, even Bellini’s own La Sonnambula all seem better equipped to offer Langridge the traction he needs for his gender politics. As it is, his freewheeling discourse on the birth of psychology feels like a tumorous growth on an already rather unhappy operatic patient.A Civil War opera peopled with Puritans and Cavaliers finds itself desperately in search of a director here, as Langridge disregards the plot-significant roles of Cromwell and Queen Henrietta Maria to romp associatively from 19th century lecture-hall and theatre to First World War battlefields. It’s Regietheater-lite, half-heartedly getting all meta after the interval as the chorus stare disdainfully back at the audience through their opera glasses, but otherwise never quite committing to its transposed milieu.There’s a lot of by-play with chairs and light-boxes, a little dancing and a maddeningly intrusive digital screen that lights up whenever things get a bit dull (yes, it’s used a lot), but none of this can quite distract from Bellini’s score, which is something of a melodious gem.Big tunes rather than fancy coloratura are the emphasis here, though the latter does get its time in the sun in big Act III arias for Arturo (Jesus Leon) and Elvira (Claire Rutter), making it rather more palatable than either Donizetti or Rossini for a psychologically-minded contemporary audience. And for those missing blunt, brassy, major-key frolics, there’s always Walton’s big martial number.After a timid and unfocused start from the male chorus, Grange Park’s Puritani gains musical momentum. Claire Rutter is an anchor, secure in her coloratura and bringing an innocence to Bellini’s rather undeveloped heroine that might yet blossom into depth if only Leon’s Arturo (pictured below) would let it. His is a light but agile tenor voice, coming into its own in Act III, but offers little by way of light and shade. He has to fight to recover from costuming that has him channelling Civil War S&M (patent leather armour, red flowing hair), and despite some attractive singing never quite connects.Some of the evening’s best work comes from Damiano Salerno as Riccardo, offering both the darker, baritonal shades that bring interest to Arturo’s conflicted rival, but also an unexpectedly powerful top to the voice. His late duet with Christophoros Stamboglis’s Walton is a highlight, and draws some of the most fleshy richness from the orchestra. Conducted by Gianluca Marciano (who seems to love this work as much as Langridge hates it), the band offer a lively and vividly articulated account of the score. And if subtlety is often jettisoned in favour of primary-coloured drama, then it’s a trade-off that Bellini’s own score fully licences.We don’t see I Puritani nearly often enough in production for so radical a rethink to be either necessary or terribly enlightening. There’s intelligence here, and a lovely eye for movement (the chorus choreography is particularly effective), but also an excess of ideas that never quite cohere into an argument, or an emotional encounter. Some of the fault is certainly Bellini’s, but rather than trust to the instincts of 19th century opera’s Byronic hero, Langridge fatally tries to compensate for a lack of substance with more ideas than the average season in a German opera house. The result doesn’t see either director or composer at their best, sadly.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/i-puritani-grange-park-opera,3
528,"Imeneo, Academy of Ancient Music, Hogwood, Barbican Hall",Imeneo,Academy of Ancient Music,2013-05-30,David Nice,"There are Handel operas where you wait impatiently for the handful of truly original set-pieces to light up the action, hoping the singers are equal to their challenges. One such is surely Siroe, Re di Persia, bravely staged at the Göttingen Handel Festival the other week. Others like Imeneo sparkle with genius and personality in virtually every number, musically if not dramatically the equal of a Shakespeare late romance.It’s a pleasure to sit through a reasonably animated concert performance like this, cast regardless, when the strings of an unshowy orchestra dart like little cupids around the love-farrago of a “plot” before turning black angels in a mock-mad scene and bizarre, by no means entirely happy ending. Christopher Hogwood let them sing in the careful measure of sophisticated, ever so slightly restrained rapture, a fair alternative to more unbuttoned Handel playing (which, to be fair, we did get in the one fireworks aria of the piece).By 1740, when Imeneo was modestly staged in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, Handel’s London Cinderella had long returned from the Italian-opera ball and sat by the fireside, still flashing her beautiful soul. The restraints may even have done her composer some good. Only one of his singers, Elisabeth “La Francesina” Duparc as heroine Rosmene who wavers between duty to her rescuer Imeneo and love for the ardent Tirinto, was a star. Rebecca Bottone’s is a light voice for such demands: nothing wrong with the mix of candyfloss and citrus, and she has style, but surely the soprano sound is too monochrome for the gravity Clomiri assumes in aping insanity to make her fatal choice.All the colours we needed were there in the briefer appearances of the phenomenal Lucy Crowe (pictured above right by Marco Borggreve) as fellow virgin Clomiri, in love with Imeneo and strictly superfluous to dramatic need. Less than two weeks after her diva triumph at Göttingen, she was back as second fiddle. Or maybe not, bearing in mind the delicious nature of her three little arias, Zerlina-charming in their shy or sly sideways glances, their discreet ornamentation. And in the third, Handel gives Clomiri a middle section of sudden and surprising heart; Crowe took us by surprise with the deep musicality and tonal range of which she’s now capable.Only Renata Pokupić’s Tirinto has music of ardour comparable to that moment of truth, and Handel launches the hero right at the start with a lovely, lightly accompanied romance. The Croatian singer (pictured below by Chris Gloag) gleamed with easy stage manner and security at the top and bottom of an impressive range. The notes above chest voice are in danger of crumbling, though – a familiar hazard for mezzos – and sometimes halted the flow of a bravura second-act number as well as the big, suddenly deadly serious Act 3 monologue.Once in gear, Stephan Loges’ sententious father settled into generous phrasing and word-awareness for “Di cieca notte”, with its sombre string unisons anticipating “The people that walked in darkness” – one of several reminders that Messiah was just around the corner when Imeneo was composed.Vittorio Prato generated the necessary virility for the title character, future god of marriage, and helped make the noble trio between Clomiri and her suitors a highlight. A reduced AAM Choir – two singers per part – felt a bit top-light, but articulated well enough in the first two jolly choruses, joined by the soloists to point the final moral that the noble soul (Rosmene) is right to prefer reason (Imeneo) to passion (Tirinto): a sentiment with which Handel clearly doesn’t agree in this peculiar outcome and, oddly gripped to the last, nor do we.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/imeneo-academy-ancient-music-hogwood-barbican-hall,3
529,"London Contemporary Orchestra, Hugh Brunt, Aldwych Station",London Contemporary Orchestra,Hugh Brunt,2013-05-28,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"Three hundred years ago we danced and ate to art music. Before that we worshipped to it. In the 19th century we began to sit and stare at it. The immersive music movement of the past decade has moved things along again. Today we are encouraged to swim through performances, sniffing the music out, hunting it down. The latest ensemble to free themselves from the sit-and-stare model are the enterprising outfit, the London Contemporary Orchestra (LCO). For their concert on Friday we had to go down 200-odd steps into the labyrinths of the disused station at Aldwych. It was well worth the effort.What has historically undermined the immersivists has been a gimmicky fetishisation of spaces at the expense of quality music programming and playing. The LCO didn’t fall into this trap. In every programming choice there was no question of why or what’s the point. This was a tightly crafted, cleverly curated and beautifully delivered evening of music.The night was built around the last work that the ill-fated Canadian composer Claude Vivier wrote, a short and unfinished opera, Glaubst du an die Unsterblichkeit der Seele (""Do You Believe in the Immortality of the Soul?""). Written in the early 1980s, the piece is one of those strange occasions in art where fiction disconcertingly presages fact. While the composer was fantasising about a stranger murdering his protagonist on a subway, the composer himself was stabbed to death by a rent boy at his home.As a fragment, the opera demands a completion of some sort. On Friday this came in the form of a musical rumination through diverse contemporary repertoire, the performances scattered across the tunnels of Aldwych Station. Much of this music channelled the uncanny tragedy of Vivier’s story. But some of it took its cue from the shyness and isolation that this neglected space evokes.A veil descended quickly upon us with the short hypnotic opener by Morton Feldman, The Viola in My Life 3, played with calm focus by Robert Ames and Antoine Francoise. This was followed by Francoise's intense performance of Thomas Ades’s atmospheric threnody for solo piano, Darknesse Visible. Alternating a stuttering melody with hefty, wide octaves, it was as if the Poor Jew and Rich Jew from Mussorgsky’s Pictures at an Exhibition were having another uncomfortable encounter.From here we descended the stairwell and boarded a train, pausing for a few minutes to hear a new work for tubular bells and cello by Gregor Riddell. Cage’s chilly Imaginary Landscape No 1 met us on the platform, piped out of speakers and accompanied by a detached film about the underground that added to the sense of urban anomie. “I’d say talk among yourselves but you’re not really allowed to do that on the undergound are you?” said the pony-tailed percussionist as we waited for the electronics to be wired up.We couldn’t talk, but the music on the train could (pictured right). This hugely attractive chamber work from Oyvind Torvund, Neon Forest Space, chatted away with impunity, at first within, then without, a groove, exploring, feeling about, bouncing around generously through an enticing array of textural worlds. You could hear the influence of Simon Steen-Anderson in the expanded sonic palette – which included the subtle interaction between spray can, mini fan and a half-empty plastic bottle of water.Next came a glimpse of heaven in a train tunnel. This was the real glory of the evening. Lamps strapped to their heads, the choir bobbed about in the dark, conductor Hugh Brunt and the tunnel’s miraculous acoustics helping to create a seraphic glow in this exquisite performance of Harvey’s marvellous choral piece The Angels. Is this tunnel not perhaps the best concert hall in London?It was a nicely spectral prelude to the Vivier, which took place on a second platform further through the labyrinth, with the orchestra and choir sat between the tracks. I’ve written before about how much I want to like Vivier but rarely do. With Glaubst, again, I felt slightly shortchanged. This time Vivier had a very good excuse for not quite getting things up to scratch. No doubt if he hadn't been murdered, he might have clarified the textures, which seemed a little smudged. Although maybe this was the acoustic. Brunt, the orchestra and singers did a fine job with what they had, capturing the strangeness of the work well, especially the Manichaean vocal battle between the Commendatore-like bass and the haunted, half-speaking, half-singing main protagonist.Site-specific concerts can be like a form of living poetry. The fraternisation that is encouraged - between architecture, music and performance - has the ability to catalyse completely new intellectual and emotional connections in the brain. Friday night was a perfect example. It was the LCO and immersivism at its very best. The days of sitting and staring are over. Long live the musical hunt.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/london-contemporary-orchestra-hugh-brunt-aldwych-station,4
530,"Lohengrin, Welsh National Opera",Lohengrin,Welsh National Opera,2013-05-24,stephen Walsh,"What is one to make of Lohengrin, Wagner’s last “opera” (as opposed to music drama), in this day and age? Is it a medieval romance, like Weber’s Freischütz but with a deus ex machina at the beginning rather than the end; or is it a nineteenth-century domestic melodrama in disguise, with the hero revealed in the bedroom scene as a Papal Nuncio travelling incognito. Why mustn’t Elsa ask his name? Is it, as Lothar Koenigs hints in the WNO programme, some echo of Wagner’s doubts about his own (possibly, as he thought, Jewish) parentage? Or is it rather a pre-echo of modern password culture, with Elsa as a sort of anthropomorphized phishing email?The last time I saw the piece, at Bayreuth two years ago, the huge stage was peopled with multi-coloured chorus-sized rats intended, according to the director, to “disrupt the smooth heraldic surface of the medieval setting.” In Cardiff, Antony McDonald disrupts it more straightforwardly by transplanting it to Wagner’s own time, with soldiers in khaki and peaked caps, Lohengrin as a vaguely hieratic figure in an embroidered tunic, and Elsa as a proto-Rossettian redhead with a visionary gaze.This mostly works well, except for Lohengrin’s arrival on the swan, which arouses unfortunate memories of King Ludwig II and the grotto at Linderhof, where his mad majesty used to float around in a swan-boat while his musicians played excerpts from the opera on the shore (pictured right by David Massey, Thomas Rowlands as Gottfried and Peter Wedd as Lohengrin). McDonald’s swan is already half androgynous-boy-in-a-boat, a couple of acts too soon, and for a ghastly moment one feared this might cast doubt on Lohengrin’s sexuality – definitely a gloss too far (no, don’t even think about it). The sword fight also strikes an odd note in 1850s Flanders, though German students still did it. But this Lohengrin is no swordsman, and he fells Telramund Wotan-like with a wave of the hand, thereby incidentally breaking the Herald’s rule which forbids the use of magic to win fights.All of which is no more than to say that Lohengrin is a true Romantic opera, scenically absurd and often (not always) psychologically vacuous, but powerful in its way for all that. Musically it’s an odd blend of the old- and new-fangled, and not without what Rossini called its mauvais quarts d’heure to punctuate the marvels, which begin with the wonderful prelude, a piece of slow unfolding that Wagner never surpassed. There are still heralds and fanfares, and thumping choruses and processions in four-four time, the sort of thing he would soon officially ban from music drama. But there are also superb stretches of dark introspection and radiant uplift that look forward to The Ring and Parsifal (whose hero, oddly enough for the celibate and woman-free land of the Grail, turns out to be Lohengrin’s father).The first night of this new production was afflicted with vocal troubles. The scheduled Telramund fell ill and was replaced at short notice by Claudio Otelli, a fine, intelligent artist, but a baritone, where the part strictly needs a proper bass. Matthew Best, playing King Henry, went down with laryngitis but battled on with only minor blockages but obvious discomfort. And even the cool, stylish Lohengrin, Peter Wedd, began in his final act narration to feel the effects of being a lyric tenor in what is very nearly a Heldentenor role.Wedd nevertheless brings off the difficult task of making the lofty – and in this staging priestly – hero as plausible in the bedroom as in the public arena, even if there are moments in this production’s third act when one might be watching La Traviata or Jenůfa rather than a medieval epic. He’s helped by a strong Elsa in Emma Bell (pictured left by Bill Cooper), piously intense and distracted at the start, then increasingly open and emancipated, with alas disastrous results (this is no feminist tract). But her vocal command never falters: it’s a lovely, touching performance. Even better is Susan Bickley’s Ortrud, the work’s evil genius, bringing ruin to all around her in the most glorious mezzo tones, and commanding the stage, as she must, until struck down, like her husband, by the raised arm of the swan-boy.Koenigs, as one would expect, is in his element, and paces the long paragraphs with sure style and firm control. The orchestral playing is superlative throughout, but notably so in the final transition, with trumpet fanfares coming at us from all sides in stage boxes and balconies – a fine Bayreuthian touch and, to tell the truth, in a different league of sheer technical brilliance. The chorus, predictably, relishes its enhanced role, as it did three years ago in Die Meistersinger. They love their Wagner. What a shame he eventually wrote them off as “scenery that has learnt to march and sing.”",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/lohengrin-welsh-national-opera,4
531,"Falstaff, Glyndebourne Festival Opera",Falstaff,Glyndebourne Festival Opera,2013-05-20,Kimon Daltas,"In this revival of Richard Jones's 2009 production, the action has been very effectively shifted to post-war Windsor with Sir John Falstaff (Laurent Naouri) as down-at-heel gentry maintaining delusions of superiority, rubbing up against an ascendant middle class. Nannetta and Fenton are presumably about to play their part in the baby boom. Period features abound, from chintz and mock Tudor to soda siphons, troupes of Brownies and a Victrola cabinet.There are witty little touches, which add to the visual appeal of the production, such as the presence of a (not terribly realistic) cat in every scene which, manipulated by a hidden puppeteer, occasionally lifts its head to follow the action. The set, though hardly lavish, is completely different for each scene, so there is plenty to look at. It feels a little churlish, therefore, to suggest that the long scene changes (curtain down, lights up, long enough for the audience to have a good natter) were a bit disruptive to the overall flow of the piece. A small point.The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment brings out the very best in Verdi's boisterous and lyrical scoreThere are no weak links in the cast in a piece which in any case doesn’t offer too many opportunities for individuals to hog the limelight; Verdi, very late in his life, largely avoids the set-piece aria in favour of forward momentum. However, there are certainly highlights.Laurent Naouri is a wonderful Falstaff with a real knack for physical comedy, helped by a grotesque fat suit, which miraculously doesn’t seem to hinder his very energetic performance. Christopher Purves, who took on this role in the production’s first outing in 2009, may have seemed like a tough act to follow, but Naouri – whose busy international schedule rarely brings him to our notice in the UK – is more than equal to the challenge. Quite apart from a magnetic stage presence, he has a big voice which is also nimble enough for passages of comic patter. If anything, his jolly, bumbling persona makes him rather difficult to dislike, and makes it harder still to sympathise with the vindictive Merry Wives.Mistress Quickly is a linchpin role, ferrying messages around and setting up the pranks. Susanne Resmark does a fantastic job, with a great line in matronly hauteur and quizzical glances, while breezing through the vocal requirements with deceptive ease. Ailyn Perez’s feisty Alice is a joy, and her voice combines beautifully with Lucia Cirillo’s Meg. Elena Tsallagova is a suitably girlish Nannetta, who slightly outsings her lovestruck Fenton (Antonio Poli).Graham Clark (Dr Caius), Colin Judson (Bardolfo), Paolo Battaglia (Pistola) bring plenty of characterisation to their supporting roles, though Roman Burdenko’s Ford could do with being a little more unpleasant, so his subplot comeuppance would be a bit more satisfying.In the pit, the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment – playing on late 19th-century instruments – plays brilliantly, bringing out the very best in Verdi’s often boisterous and occasionally lyrical score. The conductor for Falstaff needs just as much a sense of humour as the leading man to make it work, and Sir Mark Elder gets it just right, from passages of frenetic counterpoint to soaring orchestral amore.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/falstaff-glyndebourne-festival-opera,4

533,"La donna del lago, Royal Opera",La donna del lago,Royal Opera,2013-05-18,David Benedict,"I mean, really, what is the point of Rossini? That’s actually not as stupid as it sounds. No-one has ever mistaken any of his operas for taut music-drama, and even the best of them are peculiarly difficult to pull off because without first-rate singers, everything collapses. That is, without doubt, not a problem facing the Royal Opera’s new La donna del lago. Trust me: London hasn’t heard such spectacular Rossini singing in decades.Nor, indeed, has London seen a production of this opera since Covent Garden’s 1985 outing which, I’m reliably informed, boasted (good news) the great Marilyn Horne as Malcolm (bad news) in a terrible kilt. And kilts are back again, as expected in Italian opera’s first adaptation of a Walter Scott novel, a derivation that, in his house main-stage debut, director John Fulljames is insistent upon bringing to our attention.He frames the action within a highly conservative gentleman’s club, emblematic of the Royal Society of Edinburgh where Scott became president in 1820, the year after the opera’s premiere. He even turns the role of Serano into a Scott-like figure who guides and oversees the action from one side of the stage with Albina, dressed as Rossini, on the other.Celebrating all things civilised and Scottish, society members cluster around glass display cabinets housing key props and images and, initially, Joyce DiDonato’s Elena. It’s a decision oddly reminiscent of Nicholas Hytner and David Fielding’s celebrated and oft-revived ENO production of Handel’s Xerxes with which it also shares a back wall painted with an image of a landscape doubling as interior and exterior.The wall slides open to reveal Dick Bird’s huge winding staircase creating height and a hillside in a forest of tree trunks, caught in Bruno Poet’s lighting. The problem, however, is that the design is more atmospheric than the handling of the action. Fulljames is strong on concept – he puts ideas about nationalism centre-stage in an opera about a popular uprising against a king – but less so on execution (the production team was booed).The most frustrating element is the lack of detailed acting, particularly in the lengthy first act. He elicits almost no development of thought or feeling from the singers. These characters have largely made their minds up at the beginning of an aria or duet and simply restate their case. To be fair, that’s partly the fault of the libretto with its broad-brushstrokes, three-way love story complete with lovestruck Uberto being, natch, the king in disguise. But more attention to the performers' handling of the material could have created far more tension. Doubts engendered by the heavy-handed production are, however, blasted away by the singing.This was supposed to be a two-horse race. High-flying house (and world) favourite Joyce DiDonato in the title role is, after all, headlining opposite the Uberto of high-lying tenor Juan Diego Flórez (pictured above right). The latter was, frankly, born to sing this repertoire, his heady, fast-vibrato voice leaping down and up the scale to remarkable top Ds like a devil-may-care hurdler.They’re matched by the decidedly contralto-toned Malcolm of Daniella Barcellona, who has all the requisite agility that seems all the more impressive in contrast to her glowering (kilted) demeanour. But the shock of the night was American tenor Michael Spyres who, scheduled to make his debut later in the run, stepped in to replace the indisposed Colin Lee as highland chieftan Rodrigo. His knockout tenor isn’t so much full-throated as full-bodied, his support so strong that his huge, amazingly virile sound gleams, rising from an astoundingly well-grounded baritone to a ringing top C. It’s a world away from Florez, which made their second act vocal duelling over DiDonato into the most exhilarating, pulse-quickening singing bout - yes, that’s the word – I think I’ve ever heard.Like the heroine of Rossini’s Cenerentola, another choice DiDonato (pictured left) role, Elena is a character who requires early sustained beauty of tone and increasing passion before letting rip with pyrotechnics in the finale. DiDonato’s technique is so flawless that she can take immense, thrilling risks. She’s supposedly a mezzo, but she does things at the soprano end of her voice that would terrify her peers. Most audaciously, in her exultant ""Fra il padre"", she dropped to a pianissimo so hushed that, I swear, the entire house held its breath in wonder... before erupting at the curtain-call. Exhilarating.Watch Joyce DiDonato singing ""Fra il padre"" in concert Director John Fulljames introduces the production of La donna del lago",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-donna-del-lago-royal-opera,4
534,"Albert Herring, Opera North",Albert Herring,Opera North,2013-05-16,graham Rickson,"Staging Britten’s third opera in the round in a small performance space of the Howard Assembly Room makes complete sense. Albert Herring’s supporting cast of village grotesques are that little bit more oppressive when they’re singing yards away from your face. The effect is nicely claustrophobic too – after this, you somehow can’t imagine seeing this opera in a conventionally-sized opera house. And it means the audience get close to the great Dame Josephine Barstow, who as Lady Billows will be a draw for many. She’s still marvellous – you fear early on that her larger-than-life theatrics will cast a shadow over a hard-working supporting cast, but she wisely keeps things just enough in check.Britten’s librettist Eric Crozier transposed a Maupassant short story to rural Suffolk in the late 1940s. The plot revolves around the villagers’ inability to find a suitably virginal May Queen. Desperate, they choose a shy, mumbling doofus – Albert, who runs the greengrocer's with his mother, who dominates not only him but the rest of the village too. Crowned at the May Fair, Albert unwittingly drinks the rum used to lace his lemonade and plucks up the courage to live life a little more adventurously. Ostensibly a comic opera, it's perhaps never quite as funny as you’d hope, though the compact chamber orchestra provide a consistently witty commentary. Justin Doyle’s sharp conducting is alert to every glint and kink in Britten’s score.Parallels with Peter Grimes are inescapable – we’ve an ungainly outsider who’s struggling to fit in, eventually hounded by a tight-knit bunch of locals. Loxford’s villagers, apparently comic and harmless, can shift to menace in the blink of an eye in director Giles Havergal’s hands – notably when they’re screaming like a lynch mob at Albert to give a grateful speech when he’s just been crowned. Any sane person would flee in terror.Alexander Sprague makes his Opera North debut in the title role. It’s rare to find singers who are so deft physically. You’re desperate to run on and rescue him as he cowers and trembles on the dais before his coronation speech, before he transforms into swaggering insouciance as he returns, bruised and black-eyed after his drunken night out. He can also sing – the extended soliloquy in Act Two is totally confident but never too comfortable: wondrous stuff.In a score dominated by staccato outbursts, Marc Callaghan and Katie Bray stand out as Sid and Nancy, their rapturous music highlighting Britten’s gifts as a melodist. Darker pleasures come from observing the other locals - Graeme Danby’s policeman exudes slow-moving, witless heaviness, and William Dazeley’s oleaginous vicar is a treat. Fiona Kimm as Mrs Herring works hard to prevent her role descending into crude caricature. Leslie Traver’s ingenious set and costume designs are simple but delightful, the sudden appearance of real fruit and veg from a series of packing crates prompting giggles and oohs of delight among audience members. The children are excellent. It’s a treat, in other words – you can’t imagine this piece being better performed.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/albert-herring-opera-north,4
535,"The Pirates of Penzance, Scottish Opera, Theatre Royal, Glasgow",The Pirates of Penzance,Scottish Opera,2013-05-16,David Nice,"Of all the Savoy operas, this merry clash of pirates, policemen and a Major-General flanked by an entire chorus of loving daughters finds Sullivan most in tune with the mid-19th century Italian opera he so lovingly spoofs. So why can’t Martin Lloyd-Evans’s production be similarly fleet-footed with Gilbert’s resourceful, literate lyrics and whimsical plotting? Lloyd-Evans has at his disposal high-quality operatic soloists, a brilliant young chorus and a witty designer. All are squandered. The problem isn’t any clever uprooting into another time and place; after all, Scottish Opera, in league with a regenerated D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, promises us ""pure, uncomplicated fun"". Rather it can be summed up in those three fatal words: Trying Too Hard.I’d completely forgotten until I checked his biography after the show that this was the director who made me laugh in all the wrong places during his clodhop through a tragic turkey at Holland Park, Zandonai’s Francesca da Rimini. Here I chuckled, probably a little knowingly, at many of the lyrics – how could one not, at ""we shall quickly be parsonified/Conjugally matrimonified/By a Doctor of Divinity/Who resides in this vicinity""?; at the action, very little.The ensemble numbers are so giddy with frantic choreographic routines (by Steve Elias), semaphoring and general chaotic overacting that the verbal parrying which should be enough to animate them by itself gets smothered. A nightgowned Major General Stanley (Richard Suart) sings in the Act Two finale of how ""the poplars, in their pleasure, wave their arms around""; so, concealed coppers and pirates, all be trees and do likewise, at length.Most of the singers are too accomplished to be dragged down. The exception is Graeme Broadbent’s Sergeant, straight from the police academy of funny walks. Unfortunately that also comes with endless facial gurning and the unfunniest of northern accents, bizarrely echoed at times by his west-country bumpkin troop. Only Suart (pictured above surrounded by choral daughters), as the doyen of all G&S character part players, is licensed for disciplined extremes. Rosie Aldridge, as we know from her recent cameo binge drinker in Vaughan Williams’s Five Tudor Portraits, is a deft and funny comic actress. As Ruth, the piratical maid of all work who’s madly in love with the charge 26 years her junior, she’s vocally focused but forces her dramatic hand. Similarly splendid of voice but too blustery to impress is Steven Page’s Pirate King.The young lovers from the first of two alternating pairs (pictured left) come off best. Nicholas Sharratt’s sweet light lyric tenor manages to still the high jinks in Frederic's two loveliest solos; Stephanie Corley, stuck throughout with the concept of Mabel as a goggle-eyed bluestocking, has to over-parody the great coloratura waltz song but is allowed to settle in the wistful Act Two duet. A glimpse of the innate humour comes when the two are allowed to play straight their anticipated reunion in 1940 but the cause, the revelation that young Frederic was a leap year baby and, at the age of five rather than 21, still indentured to the pirates, also passes for little in an overworked trio routine.Veteran G&S interpreter John Owen Edwards – says the programme, though it appeared to be alternate conductor Derek Clark taking the first night bow – neatly underlines the spry continuity of the score. The young chorus, stepping in for Scottish Opera’s long and shamefully disbanded regulars, shines in the spine-tingling and very unexpected Act One ode to poetry and manages to articulate crisply through so many fussy routines. Jamie Vartan economically conjures many more scenes than the original provides for – tilting ship, picturebook Cornish cliffs, tiny chapel which provides for a predictable homage to the cabin scene in the Marx Brothers’ A Night at the Opera. But all this is much diminished when the director ignores the key G&S lesson to trust the material and let the sounds, both verbal and musical, take care of themselves.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/pirates-penzance-scottish-opera-theatre-royal-glasgow,3

537,"Don Carlo, Royal Opera",Don Carlo,Royal Opera,2013-05-05,David Nice,"An operatic truism still doing the rounds declares that for Verdi's Il trovatore you need four of the greatest singers in the world. For Don Carlo, his biggest opus in every way, you need six. Nicholas Hytner's Covent Garden staging hits the mark third time around with five, the exception being a very honourable replacement for what would have been an interesting piece of casting. Add to the mix the experienced command of Royal Opera music director Antonio Pappano, supportive of the singers but also attentive to every instrumental detail, and it's as near to Verdian perfection as we're probably going to get.Even the production, revived here by Paul Higgins, seems more fine-tuned than I remember to the scope and symmetries of the drama. Schiller's Shakespearean royal epic as translated by Verdi into grand opera remains a model of its kind for the balance of the private and the public, the head and the heart, melodrama and truthfulness. There's enough material for at least three strong operas. One would be sustained by the love triangle between Elisabetta di Valois, Don Carlo - the man she loves - and his father Philip II, the king she's forced to marry, with complications added by the Princess Eboli, who loves the infante and is seduced by the king. A second could be devoted to freedom-fighter Rodrigo, Marquis of Posa. And the stifling air in the scene between Philip and the Grand Inquisitor points the way to a new drama of politics versus religion.With telling clarity, the Hytner view binds it all together and now seems to me to highlight how everyone at the Spanish court, with the exception of hapless infante Carlo, holds the key to power one minute only to be stricken the next. Swooning or dying characters held in desperate embraces embody the failure of a dream.Seen from the balcony Bob Crowley's designs, meshing handsome period costume with more symbolic settings of oppressive black against gaudy oranges and reds, interact more cleary with the blocking of characters to show their closeness or their distance in relation to each other. Only one scene still falters visually - the biggest, the auto-da-fé; it's surely time to remove the obstructive semi-circular wall draped with the bloody head of Christ, but there it remains, cramping the style of the Les Mis crowd (the Royal Opera Chorus in flaming form).Otherwise, the gripping continuity of the drama in the great scenes - the garden outside the monastery, Philip's study and the last farewell at San Yuste - depend on the principal singers' skill. As Verdi unfolds one great aria or confrontation after another, we're left weak-kneed by the achievements of this cast in terms of line, colour and feeling. Jonas Kaufmann takes some time to warm in the opening Fontainebleau act - we're talking the five-act Italian Don Carlo of 1886 - since he's hampered by that bottled backward placement which can strangulate the sound; nor are there sunshine and roses in the voice to characterise the love-hopeful innocent.Come the monastery bonding-duet with Mariusz Kwiecien's Rodrigo (pictured above), he's already rising to top form. Kwiecien is a singer surely at his absolute peak, musically sensitive enough to tune to his tenor but also the ideal Verdi baritone in legato line, as his usually not much noticed address to Elisabetta in the following scene limpidly demonstrates. After a rather wild Veil Song from Béatrice Uria-Monzon's Eboli, more supple of stage movement than of voice, one of the great sequences in all Verdi never falters.It's now apparent that in Anja Harteros we have another ideal Verdian: floating a line with luminous assurance, forceful in dramatic exclamation and perfectly at ease in her body, fully revealing the pain and difficulty with which regal composure is achieved. Ferruccio Furlanetto's Philip (pictured below with Harteros) is already a known quantity, but he has added to the depths of a tyrant only Verdi could make sympathetic. The beginnings are already there when a sob, a crack in the voice reveals his anguish to Rodrigo, the son he would have wanted.Prefaced by Pappano's typically human ROH orchestral cello, Furlanetto takes us straight to the heart of the king's interior anguish in the study scene. The ensuing psychic battle with the formidable if physically frail Grand Inquisitor of Eric Halfvarson - announced by Director of Opera Kasper Holten as ailing, though you wouldn't have known it - matches inky-black voices and baleful orchestral lower brass. A third bass, Robert Lloyd as the mysterious monk, is in much better death's-head form than when I last heard him in the role, and two young singers make their mark in bit parts, promising tenor and Jette Parker Young Artist Pablo Bernsch as the Count of Lerma and Susana Gaspar, an appropriately Heavenly Voice.Pappano's care with the unusual colour of so many chords, the inflections of the woodwind, sorrowful companions to the star-crossed would-be lovers, go beyond the usual call of duty. Equally admirable is the space he gives his singers to negotiate the larger phrases, the constant rubato he uses to go with them at every point.In any other cast, Furlanetto's ""Ella giammai m'amò"" would be the absolute highlight of the evening. Here it simply marked the start of the musical-dramatic game-upping. A great quartet, a slight dip perhaps in Uria-Monzon's ""O don fatale"" - but again, decent work from a singer of more generalised Verdian skills than the others whom you'd still be glad to see in most productions - before more superb, long-phrased cantabile singing from Kwiecien in Rodrigo's hour of death.And then, that final act. I've never heard more perfect handling of the insane demands Verdi puts upon his soprano in her big, summing-up aria, and I bet you that those elders who grumble about a past age of great singing never have either. Harteros's compass from that ringing or ethereal top down to a chest voice more impressive than that of the evening's mezzo seems rock solid, her variation in tone-colour for each of the debts to the past the Queen is now putting behind her simply astonishing.Kaufmann joins her to pull out the stops for his huge phrases before the final duet, and then the atmosphere becomes even more rareified. They sing, on the brink of audibility, about meeting in a better world; in our own, opera doesn't get any better than this. Let's hope the magic lasts when Lianna Haroutounian takes over from Harteros in two performances' time. Five stars, in the meanwhile, for five stars (and one more for the conductor). What a way to crown Verdi bicentenary year. As news comes in that Harteros has had to cancel her remaining two performances owing to acute tonsillitis, here's some small compensation for those with tickets: her Bavarian State Opera performance of the last-act aria ""Tu che le vanità"". Not as perfect as on Saturday night, but outstanding all the sameAnd the final duet with Kaufmann, from the same production ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/don-carlo-royal-opera-0,5
538,"La bohème, English National Opera",La bohème,English National Opera,2013-04-30,alexandra Coghlan,"I’m not one to get misty-eyed over La bohème (unless it be a red mist of rage), but this second revival of Jonathan Miller’s production at English National Opera brought me closer than any yet to understanding the snuffling, lip-quivering reactions of those around me in the Coliseum stalls. And if it wasn’t exactly emotion that got me there, then perhaps it was something even better: sentimental delight in joyous, glorious music-making.La bohème has suffered more than most operas at the hands of clever directors and conceptual visions. But at this stage in his career Miller has nothing to prove, and it’s a relief and a pleasure to settle down into his production and Paris of the 1930s. I remember struggling with its slightly too-sanitised, too-pretty portrait of poverty back in 2010, but things seem to have toughened up just a bit in this latest revival directed by Natascha Metherell.Mimi and Rodolfo may be about to unite under gentle snowfall and to some of Puccini’s most soaring music, but a prostitute unobtrusively plies her trade with a sailor in the background; Musetta (Angel Blue, pictured below) may be the toast of the Café Momus, but we still find her being pawed by an over-eager patron in a cheap bar. The Depression doesn’t scream here, but in the muted shades of Isabella Bywater’s designs its quiet desperations sidle and seep persistently into our consciousness.Only Amanda Holden’s translation strikes a jarring note – a rare misfire from ENO’s most reliably witty and skilled librettist. Dull syllables are stressed, vernacular phrases feel self-conscious and rhyming couplets force themselves upon our attention. But none of this detracts from the excellence of the finest quartet yet of leads in this production. Gwyn Hughes Jones (Rodolfo) just gets better and better with every appearance at ENO, relishing each leap and cherishing every vaulting top note, with “O Mimi, tu piu non torni” in his sights from the very start.Thanks to Oleg Caetani in the pit speeds are defiantly swift, lending an urgency and matter-of-factness to proceedings that cuts nicely against any lingering sentimentalism there might be about the opera. His surging, warmly enthusiastic orchestra (occasionally just a touch too dominant) carries us along through romance and tragedy almost before we’re ready for it – an approach that might not fly with the self-indulgent big-names up at Covent Garden, but works a treat here with a young cast (two major role debuts among them).Kate Valentine’s Mimi is a genuine innocent – quite a shift from Elizabeth Llewellyn’s rather more knowing ingénue previously – and deliciously ardent with it. Less controlled than her Countess in ENO’s recent Figaro, Mimi feels like a role she may never play better dramatically but vocally will only gain colour and nuance from repetition. Also making his role debut is Richard Burkhard’s Marcello, leading the all-male scenes (pictured left) with warmth of tone and some beautiful phrasing, and managing not to be entirely eclipsed by Angel Blue’s Musetta – quite the feat.It’s hard to imagine a more natural Musetta than the charismatic Blue, who sounds almost as good as she looks doing it. Fuller and heavier in her upper register than some, hers is the performance that really balances up to the ENO Orchestra in full flow, less the brittle seductress than a shrewd woman of the world who knows exactly how to play the game. Simon Butteriss returns to steal the scene with his cockney Benoit (“I may be old but I’m still randy!”), and Duncan Rock rounds out the young artists as a dynamic Schaunard.ENO are at their best when experimenting, when taking risks and defending their very different role and mission to the Royal Opera. It’s been a tough few months for them though, and while they gather themselves for the next big push of concept and technology-driven works it’s a pleasure to be able to relax into such an accomplished, enjoyable production. Jonathan Miller’s bohème isn’t a game-changer in the showy, PR sense, but if its gentle realism and blindingly good music can persuade some first-time opera-goers to take a risk on another show, then it really doesn’t need to be.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-boh%C3%A8me-english-national-opera-0,4
539,"Mangan, Royal Academy Opera Students, BBCSO, Denève, Barbican Hall",Mangan,Royal Academy Opera Students,2013-04-27,David Nice,"Highly sexed cockerels and cats, a lovesick lion and a ballet of frogs might not seem like a recipe, or rather a menagerie, for profundity. Yet in two ravishing French man (or child)-meets-beast fables for the stage, Poulenc and Ravel are quite capable of tearing at our heartstrings. That they did so unremittingly last night was very largely due to the supernaturally beautiful sounds master conjuror Stéphane Denève drew from the BBC Symphony Orchestra.Yet more than just the icing on the cake was the collective and individual presence of students from the Royal Academy of Music for Ravel's L'enfant et les sortilèges. So at least three ages of man – children as young as two with their parents in the audience for this Family Concert, teenagers and twentysomethings onstage and off and the rest of us – played their part in a miraculous evening.It might seem reductive to limit a musician to national specialities, but having heard Denève’s Berlioz, Debussy and Roussel in concert, his captivating disc of Poulenc with the Stuttgart orchestra he commands and now his Ravel, I can honestly say there’s no conductor alive I’d rather hear in French music. He pledged his faith in the unorthodox by starting with Poulenc’s suite from the 1940s ballet based on La Fontaine, Les animaux modèles.Only the 50th anniversary of the lovable Poulenc’s death could have coaxed two performances of this rarity out of its cage in less than a month. But where the City of London Sinfonia’s Southwark Cathedral rendition was lumpy and obscure, all was clear and buoyant here. It helped enormously that we had that quicksilver actor Stephen Mangan (pictured right) reading the La Fontaine fables in between numbers (in Southwark, most of us remained ignorant of their morals, and the programme offered no help).Sounding not one false note in a witty new translation by Craig Hill and never overdoing the funny voices, Mangan chilled us to the bone in the tale of the woodcutter tired of a life without light or joy who invites death. Denève, who had scattered brisk, sensuous stardust over his orchestra from the start, underlined Poulenc’s gravely beautiful Pas de deux with poised assistance from oboist Richard Simpson and perfectly gauged wind and brass ensembles. With Mangan delivering a final envoi of warning to victors – the Boches would of course have been in the Paris audience at the 1942 premiere – justice was done to the composer’s written insistence on the ballet’s moments of seriousness. Now we need to hear the whole thing, not just the suite.Where Poulenc is poignant, Ravel breaks the heart. There’s so much more to his one-act operatic masterpiece than the tale of a naughty child who gets roughed up by the objects and animals he’s tormented, and learns a lesson. All that the composer had suffered serving in the First World War, all the losses – so many friends as well as, most significantly, the mother invoked in the opera – feed into the profound nostalgia and regret between the comic numbers. Denève and the many orchestral solos hit the right, exquisite note every time, especially in the piping pastoral of ripped wallpaper shepherds and shepherdesses, the solo flute (Michael Cox) that accompanies the picturebook princess (Sónia Grané, mesmerizing) and the floating violin line that drifts above, of all things, waltzing frogs. Is Ravel the master of all orchestrators? It seemed so here.Yet what made this performance unique, in my experience, was not so much the serviceable film and video sequences by Jean-Baptiste Barrière (pictured above at Montreal in 2007), simple enough to keep children posted of which character sings what, as the participation of the RAM students. The uniformly fine soloists seemed to know Colette's enchanting French text from the inside, led by Rozanna Madylus’s impetuous and touching Child. Better still, I wonder if Ravel’s choruses have ever been more glowingly and subtly served than by the ensemble from which the individual singers stepped out. The animals’ final fugal salute to a ""good boy"" could only leave us drifting out of the hall speechless, hands pointing to hearts.

540,"Monteverdi Choir, London Symphony Orchestra, Gardiner, Barbican Hall",Monteverdi Choir,London Symphony Orchestra,2013-04-26,David Nice,"Backed up by reasonably adventurous orchestral programming, lucky conductors can forge a strong Stravinsky evening by picking and mixing from his five ancient Greek rituals. Sir John Eliot Gardiner, unintentionally homaging the late Sir Colin Davis who at least in earlier days would have jumped to such a pairing, chose to celebrate his 70th birthday with the extremes of white balletic lyric poem Apollon musagète and hard-hitting blackest tragedy Oedipus Rex.Apollo’s celestial strings and the acerbic mix of brass with woodwind in Oedipus, all superbly aligned, guaranteed further contrasts. But with the ballet too rooted in the opera-oratorio’s sometimes muddy earth to soar heavenwards, the poles were not as far apart as they might have been.Gardiner certainly dotted every ""i"" and crossed every ""t"" in Stravinsky’s immaculately shaded serenade for strings. The composer's musical realization of French verse rhythms projected perfectly; no entry faltered, no inner line went unclarified. There were chordal mysteries about the sun god’s birth, LSO leader Tomo Keller’s arrival as Apollo on the scene coolly charmed and the expected metaphysics arrived in the great Pas de deux, with Stravinsky’s gift for being simple when it matters underlined by the three throwaway refrains.Yet the violins, standing around the semicircle of cellos and violas, did not quite create the expected halo. And Gardiner’s usual rejection of romantic rubato – whether he can do it or not I’ve yet to hear – meant that the choreographic vision this conjured was that of Nijinsky’s deliberately mannerist, earthbound Rite of Spring poses rather than the soaring poetry of Balanchine, who properly arrived on the scene with Apollo. This sphinx-like score can taken many different interpretations; perhaps it's simply that I prefer one sort, and Gardiner another.It might have been even more daring to put Apollo, as the totally unexpected 1928 sequel to Oedipus Rex, in the second half. That, as it happened, got off to an unexpectedly mirthful start. What on earth were the poor chaps of the Monteverdi Choir doing in zombie make-up above their black shirts and trousers? Did no one say at an early stage, ""that’s naff, drop it""?Anyway, they sang Stravinsky’s purposefully perverse accentuation of cast-iron Latin stunningly well, and yielded two true basses, Alexander Ashworth and David Shipley, as important soloists from the ensemble. As Oedipus,  Stuart Skelton (pictured above by John Wright) was near-ideal: it’s difficult to get a singer who can cope both with the Monteverdian melismas and a stentorian leadership that quickly falters. Heldentenor Skelton smudged only a couple of runs, but an early payoff came in the clarion cry of ""Ego clarissimus Oedipus"" (""I, the most famous Oedipus""), the upper-register tone was golden throughout and he scaled down the voice to the blank realization of the truth in ""lux facta est"".Stravinsky’s unity in diverse homages is difficult to find, and though similarly magnificent of timbre, Jennifer Johnston played Jocasta as Hammer Horror mamma rather than tragedy queen. That role went to the glorious Fanny Ardant (pictured left) – quite a replacement for the originally advertised Charlotte Rampling – in the spoiler-narrator role originally grabbed by librettist Cocteau; despite a frog in the throat, she could hardly have been more regal.Hamming it up worse than Johnston was another, this time uncredited, tenor from the Monteverdis. The usually colossal voice of Gidon Saks as Creon, stage right, could hardly be heard from opposite-sided stalls, and this was a problem throughout: a too-loud orchestra never in sympathy with the soloists. Too much blaring in the first half of the drama robs the denouement, with what Bernstein described as a college football song gone crazy, of its sudden feral intensity. Plenty of interest, then, but not enough pity or terror about this Oedipus.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/monteverdi-choir-london-symphony-orchestra-gardiner-barbican-hall,3
541,"Juan Diego Flórez and friends, Barbican Hall",Juan Diego Flórez and friends,Barbican Hall,2013-04-22,alexandra Coghlan,"It takes a certain kind of artist to book American mezzo-extraordinaire Joyce DiDonato as a supporting act. It’s a risk. Even if you happen to be Juan Diego Flórez. But it’s one that actually paid off on the first night of Flórez’s three-concert residency at the Barbican.Joined not only by DiDonato but by soprano Julia Novikova and baritone Marco Caria (as well as the massed forces of the LSO), Flórez showed us a softer side than the bravado-recitalist we usually see during his London visits. Surrounded by his peers, duetting, quartetting and generally sharing the spotlight, Flórez rather paradoxically came into focus in a way I’ve rarely seen outside the opera house.Perhaps it’s the challenge of matching a singer like DiDonato, or greater familiarity with the operatic rather than song repertoire. Perhaps it’s just that performing with colleagues takes some of the rigidity out of the recital process. But whatever the cause, Flórez sang more freely and with greater commitment to character than he has previously demonstrated in London, offering his audience an evening of operatic lollipops that smuggled in a surprising amount of drama and no little musical interest along with its big tunes and top notes.Very little of which interest came courtesy of conductor Guillermo García Calvo (a late replacement for Karel Mark Chichon) or the London Symphony Orchestra. For a symphony orchestra with a fighting claim to being London’s finest, the LSO certainly do a good impression of the worst. Smudged entries, ensemble issues, tempo madness and tuning disagreements were rife; presumably a programme of bel canto overtures and famous arias was the least of their priorities this week in allocating rehearsal time, but the result was cheap and needlessly scruffy. Music from Rigoletto and I vespri Siciliani was a late high-point, but by that time we’d been so baffled and battered by music from L’elisir d’amore and La Cenerentola that it struggled to make its impact.Flórez himself appeared as an unexpectedly ardent lover, crooning his way through a faultless “Una furtiva lagrima” with the help of a plangent solo bassoon, and offered us a wonderfully dramatic triptych of moods and contrasting tone colours in “Popoli dell’egitto” from Meyerbeer’s forgotten Il Crociato in Egitto. His performance of the Duke’s arias from Rigoletto made you long to see him in the role, but despite all this it was still the memory of DiDonato’s “Se Romeo” from Bellini’s I Capuletti e i Montecchi that lingered as we left the Barbican Hall (Donato pictured right).While baritone Caria failed to make much of a mark (fighting an already-lost battle for dramatic supremacy with Flórez in the Belcore/Nemorino duet “Venti scudi”), Novikova did rather better. If her “Je veux vivre” was emotionally a little overripe, and her Gilda a little too knowing, there was no arguing with the evenness of her tone, nor her projection, which emerged well in the balance of the Rigoletto quartet – a triumphant and satisfyingly substantive finale after so much musical fluff.Next week we’ll have the chance to see Flórez the solo-artist and Flórez the vocal coach, but whatever happens the residency has already offered us something new and valuable – a chance to see this stage animal in something more akin to his natural habitat, while keeping all the concert hall’s advantages of intimacy and proximity. A Flórez concert is always a party, and this was no exception, ending in two encores and cheers that belonged in a stadium rather than a recital hall. The superstar tenor certainly gave us all a good time, and on a chilly Sunday night in April there’s a lot to be said for anyone peddling the easy sunshine of Donizetti and the careless ardours of Gounod and Rossini. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/juan-diego-fl%C3%B3rez-and-friends-barbican-hall,4
542,"Sunken Garden, English National Opera, Barbican Theatre",Sunken Garden,English National Opera,2013-04-13,alexandra Coghlan,"Sunken Garden is described officially as a “film opera”. Two words. Emphatically unhyphenated. No attempt made to neologise or fashion some third-way genre terminology. It’s not a symbol that bodes well for mutually-informed, sensitive interdisciplinary thinking, but in Michael Van der Aa and David Mitchell’s work English National Opera have come one tiny, shuffling step closer to realising that elusive multimedia idée fixe that has so preoccupied the company under John Berry.First we had the atrocity that was Mike Figgis’s Lucrezia Borgia (soft-core rompings on screen and wooden barkings on stage), then the curious but fatally flawed Two Boys with its digital meta-play, and now Sunken Garden – the first opera conceived in cinematic 3D. It’s been a gradual move towards self-awareness, a process in which we’ve all understood the degree to which film and technology must be integrated conceptually and thematically as well as technically into an opera for it to work.And it’s not only ENO. At Lyon just a few weeks ago video artist Gary Hill premiered his new space-age Fidelio (heading to Edinburgh this summer) in which live action and projected images interact freely, creating a third visual dimension even as it kicks down the fourth wall. The opera world is trying harder than ever to develop, to keep itself current and (shudder) relevant. But in trying on so many different multimedia identities for size, has it forgotten who and what it really is?“The public will only believe the truth if it is shot in 3D,” sings video artist Toby Kramer (Roderick Williams) midway through Sunken Garden. And we in the audience laugh, sharing the little joke with Mitchell’s knowing libretto. Mitchell gets it; Van der Aa gets it: so why then is this collaboration between two such clever and talented artists so unsatisfying, so lacking in emotional truth?Perhaps it’s the sense that if the opera-makers and composers themselves don’t trust the music and drama to do their work, then it becomes very hard for the audience to trust either. Every attempt to get closer, more naturalistic, more current in Sunken Garden – and they are legion – only defers the emotions another degree further away. The colours in the digital Eden may be brighter, the flowers rather more lovely (even the insect-life is vividly present) but in practice they might as well be a Brechtian rectangle with “Garden” scrawled on it for all the immediacy they generate. Yes there’s exhilaration and marvel to be had in the precise, minute integration of holographic and real action, but it never quite makes the transition from clever visual trick to embedded artistic gesture.The work’s many-stranded Mitchell narrative (constructed from pre-filmed spoken segments, integrated video and live music, and more conventional opera) makes a knowing nod to all the familiar operatic tropes. There’s a wicked sorceress, an imprisoned princess, a magical land and a questing hero. It’s lovingly done, but also incredibly convoluted. Of all the aspects of opera for so progressive a work to remain faithful to, the contorted Handelian plot might not be the obvious choice.The noir-ish, digital-ish subject matter feels strangely close to Two Boys, without solving any of the pacing problems that the earlier thriller-opera raised. The denouement feels rushed, and with too much exposition left to the end there’s something of a scramble to assimilate the final twists. The best moments are Mitchell’s Bennett-esque Talking Heads, but these seem like the yearnings of a piece that doesn’t want to be an opera at all, but would rather just be allowed to tell its story the old-fashioned way, thank you very much.Which brings us to the music. Van der Aa has an expansive musical vocabulary that is accessible enough for the ear but also substantive enough for the mind. Yet this isn’t the composer at his best. Pastiche moments of baroque and dance music showcase his breadth of reference, and his brittle, vicious little ostinatos chafe pleasingly against the smooth arcs of his vocal writing, but when emotions run high he consistently ducks out, sending spoken words in to sub for the arias we might have had. The performers however, both live and holographic, are excellent, with Katherine Manley once again proving her vocal quality. And conductor André de Ridder makes an efficient job of the score.The qualities that make a good film are, if not antithetical, then surely at odds with the reach-out-and-touch immediacy of opera – the livest of live art-forms. And while both come down to good storytelling and emotional truth, they each arrive there by entirely distinct routes. Two roads diverge in Mitchell and Van der Aa’s digital wood and they have chosen to take both at once. It’s a process that ultimately leaves them standing exactly where they started – questioning whether there can ever be such a thing as a great, truly multimedia opera?",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/sunken-garden-english-national-opera-barbican-theatre,2
543,"Orpheus, Classical Opera Company, Page, London Handel Festival",Orpheus,Classical Opera Company,2013-03-23,Roderic Dunnett,"A toast to London’s Handel Festival, now celebrating its 36th year, and to Ian Page’s adventurous Classical Opera Company, for pulling Telemann out of the drawer and placing him in the forefront of this year’s celebrations at St. George’s, Hanover Square. There used to be a school of thought, part-informed and partly way off-beam, that Telemann, and others of Bach’s contemporaries, were boring: Baroque musical wallpaper, worthy but shorn of the structural daring, instrumental colouring and spiritual intensity of JS Bach’s most affecting scores. That’s not a view Bach took: he left us a list of composers he most admired that topped 30. And Telemann, godfather to Bach’s son Carl Philipp Emanuel, was number one choice.Ian Page’s reading didn’t start with the bang and thrust of Rene Jacobs's Harmonia Mundi recording: initially it felt a little well-mannered. But there was a lot more to come, where Page captured the same sense of urgency, and dramatic high jinks, as characters, steely or otherwise, established themselves.One major reason for the opera’s patent value is the quality of the libretto, penned in 1690 by Michel du Boullay for an Orpheus opera by Lully's son. Possessed of a bit of the invention that characterised Monteverdi’s Poppea librettist, Busunello,  it has something for every cast member (even the shy soubrette - Elinor Rolfe Johnson - gets a powerful hit of an aria near the end). It shifts between moods of hope and anger, jealousy and despair, such as one finds in (say) Idomeneo or any Salieri opera. Even where it touches on platitude, which is not often, it has emotional depth and power. It’s a bit of a masterpiece.The chief masterpiece, however, is Telemann’s music - its range and subtlety and colouring (his use of oboe, recorder and cello obbligato is exceptional in this work) - the calibre of the performance. The verve of these young singers to mug up the entire German text, arias and massive chunks of recitative, the risk it entails and the hours of work - in addition to mastering the notes - for just one performance, and the lack of any hint of nerves, is to me, who can scarcely remember a hexameter, truly breathtaking. They were, without exception, splendid.Pluto’s attendant and major-domo (Rupert Enticknap) had presence as well as a lovely but equally cutting tone, fluent and assured. The recitative of other male companion in this opera, Orpheus’s Pylades-like pal Eurimedes (tenor Alexander Sprague - another find) somehow beefed up this presentation when it most needed it (his main task is to cheer up a despondent Orpheus). Sprague’s own ode to elusive love was charming; and when he sings of the little birds and zephyrs (""Augeletti, che cantate"") we can almost hear the breeze and trees. It was attractive as well as accomplished.  Eleanor Dennis as the amorous old boot who brings about the demise of both Eurydice and Orpheus, sang with a mild vibrato that, initially tiresome, perhaps helped set her apart. Orasia is the sort of smug, spoilt lady of the manor who would sing with a bossy wobble. Certainly du Boullay and Telemann, who himself probably tweaked the libretto quite a bit, give this overbearing monster plenty of cowish lines (her vendetta aria was terrific: think of Idomeneo’s Electra). But at the end, having ditched both rival and erstwhile love (Orpheus is ripped apart by her Thracian maenads), Orasia has the plum: the aria ""Hélas, quels soupirs"". This is so Paris-imbued it almost sounds like Purcell. It was probably the highlight of the whole evening. Jonathan McGovern’s Orpheus, sweet and smiling like a becapped prep school boy, initially a joyous newlywed, only occasionally gets tough. Doughty yet buffeted, McGovern brings an earnest beauty to everything he sings, especially the sensational ""Ach Tod, ach süsser Tod"", sung pianissimo over pizzicato strings – Telemann at his most achingly beautiful. The rest was a lot of fun. Alex Ashworth boomed impressively from the pulpit as a Pluto. The chorus, as dogs and, elsewhere singing nymphs, were rather good, though I sensed their consonants were less than strong. Were there hints of tuning approximation amid Ashworth’s noble, unfraternal declamations? If so, they were minimal. Ashworth’s ""Zu den Waffen!"" (""To arms!"") is apparently a reconstructed aria; it was certainly one of the best. And ""Ruhet, ir Foltern"", when Pluto does a complete U-turn (again, quality libretto), was intensely moving and delicateBut time and again Page’s orchestra (pictured above right) proved its worth. Without their excellence, Telemann might again have been doomed. Instead we heard a score that frankly deserves the accolade of masterpiece - well up to Handel's standard. The moment when Orpheus’s music is heard in Hades - what seemed like a bass recorder played high in its register in a plangent cantilena - was pure magic. Telemann concocts a deliciously hellish prelude, the harmonies creaking as perhaps only he can do, to Act II. And there’s a funny dance (""Niais"") that sounds like a hurdy-gurdy.Eurydice’s (initial) farewell is sung plaintively by Rhian Lois over just harpsichord continuo, as if life is ebbing away. Telemann and du Boullay, however, miss one trick. After the sparagmos (ripping apart), Orpheus’s severed head floats down the river, still singing. You can’t do the visual bit in a concert performance; but it might have made a prettier musical ending.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/orpheus-classical-opera-company-page-london-handel-festival,4
544,"Die Feen, Chelsea Opera Group, Queen Elizabeth Hall",Die Feen,Chelsea Opera Group,2013-03-18,David Nice,"Like Prokofiev’s The Love for Three Oranges and Puccini’s Turandot, Wagner’s first opera – The Fairies in English – has its roots in a “theatrical fable” by the 18th century Venetian playwright Carlo Gozzi. There the resemblances end. Only Prokofiev follows Gozzi’s playful mix of commedia dell’arte and fairy-tale characters. The 20-year-old Wagner has one moment of fun – cut in this performance – but a mere handful of musical gestures and plot devices prophesying greatness to come rises to the surface in this gloopy mess. You’ve got to admire the ambitious scope of it, but inspiration is nowhere to be found.If any conductor can stir the lumps in young Wagner's very thick porridge, it’s the dynamic Dominic Wheeler (pictured below), and if any company can light the dramatic touchpaper in a concert performance, it’s the Chelsea Opera Group, with its bold instinct for casting fine singers and its enthusiastic semi-professional orchestra. Wheeler instantly made the violins rise heroically in their pure-Weber upsurges throughout the overture, with its one hint of things to come in a phrase rhythmically identical to the one in The Flying Dutchman’s Act Two finale.That’s it as far as memorable long lines go, but the story and the insane musical demands loaded on its three principals can keep the interest stoked. The convoluted plot essentially involves the vicissitudes of a mortal, Prince Arindal, and a semi-fairy, Ada, his wife of eight years who at the beginning of the opera has vanished when asked the forbidden question about her identity and will turn to stone if he can’t resist the horrors she is forced to inflict on him and curses her for them (he does).That means the mythic devices look forward not only to Lohengrin but also to Dvořák’s Rusalka, Strauss’s Die Frau ohne Schatten – Andrew Porter’s note tells us Strauss the conductor helped prepare the first performance of Die Feen after Wagner’s death – and Sullivan’s Iolanthe, where the fairies tread much more lightly than Wagner’s booted specimens. You’d have thought that Mendelssohn’s Midsummer Night’s Dream Overture and Mozart’s The Magic Flute, with its three trials anticipating Arindal’s in Act Three, had never happened by 1833.At least Wagner has delicate woodwind to paint Ada’s otherness, in the manner if not the matter of Brünnhilde’s humiliation in Act Three of Die Walküre. All eyes and ears, though, are on the soprano who has to manage her absurdly long and broken-backed Act Two aria in which she resolves to sacrifice immortality for love.Young New Zealander Kirstin Sharpin rose jaw-droppingly to the challenge.The luminous warmth enveloping her dramatic-soprano strength will make Sharpin a fabulous Straussian, and she stood in perfect contrast to the steelier glint of Elisabeth Meister (pictured left by Brian Tarr) as Arindal’s warrior sister Lora. Meister was just recovering from a heavy cold, had learnt her part in three weeks and was commuting back and forth from Lucrezia Borgias in Brussels, but you could still hear that this is an ideal Brünnhilde in the making.With Meister’s arrival in Act Two came a raising of the stakes for both the sometimes unruly chorus - sopranos holding it all together - and the orchestra. It was the start of serious vocal challenges for the likeable tenor hero, Dane David Danholt. This is a gleaming, youthful voice, ideal for Mozart’s doughtier protagonists like Tito and Idomeneo, but more mad vocal writing stretched Danholt to the limit, and beyond in Act Three. Still, conviction proved to be all, as it was for a villainess fairy suddenly thrust to the fore as his enemy, resplendent mezzo Emma Carrington as devious Farzana. The happy end, initiated by a brief harp-accompanied prize song for the hero to his now-lapidary love with everything going for it except the musical idea, had everybody smiling. A youthful opera with a young, promising cast: exactly what we need in Wagner’s bicentenary year.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/die-feen-chelsea-opera-group-queen-elizabeth-hall,3
545,"The Gospel According to the Other Mary, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Dudamel, Barbican Hall",The Gospel According to the Other Mary,Los Angeles Philharmonic,2013-03-17,David Nice,"“I do not believe in miracles,” scoffs Herodias in Oscar Wilde’s -  and Richard Strauss’s - Salome. “I have seen too many.” I know how she feels. So it was a bit of a shock to find the highest-kicking of today’s composers, John Adams, and his inseparable genius director Peter Sellars, taking the raising of Lazarus seriously in the first part of their latest opera-oratorio (my term, not theirs, and also applicable to El Niño, Adams’s millennial take on Christ’s birth and its concomitant hazards).What that meant in practice, for me at any rate, was to sit through Act One compelled by every bar of a fluid, dynamic score which is so clearly in the blood and bones of conductor, players and singers, but simultaneously repelled by what sometimes felt like an hysterical and humourless Born Again rally. Act Two, though, dealing with the shock and awe of the Passion proper, redeemed all with the miracle of transformation.In The Gospel According to the Other Mary – Magdalene, spotlit alongside more dutiful sister Martha and brother Lazarus – Sellars and Adams have gone beyond anything they’ve done before: the director by refining, the composer by expanding timespans, transitions and orchestral colours (this time the Hungarian cimbalom adds a special new sonority). As the programme fails to tell us, Adams has also thoroughly overhauled and trimmed the score since its 2012 premiere in Los Angeles’s Walt Disney Hall; the now-acclaimed revision was heard there 10 days ago before heading for various premieres in European countries including this long-awaited UK first.I’d worried, on the evidence of information overload in El Niño and an almost frenzied repetition in recent shows, that Sellars had exhausted his once potent vocabulary of semaphores and shared hugs to convey a state of heightened emotions. Here, limited mostly to two small raised wooden acting spaces –  a third gave just enough room for action to the chorus at the back (pictured with principals and Dudamel right) – the six singers and three dancers knew exactly how to measure the pain and the grief. With no sign of Sellars’s regular collaborator Mark Morris, and no choreographer credited, their moves were simple, graceful, at times soul-piercing.The material they had to work with didn’t always make things easy. In the mosaic of texts which Adams has preferred since the departure of Alice Goodman, surely the finest poet-librettist since Hofmannsthal, strands come and go. Mary and Martha for All Women offer brief contemporary resonances in the opening scene of the former’s imprisonment and the latter’s home for destitute women, as well as later – more powerfully – in the parallel of their arrest with César Chavéz’s farm worker protests and Dorothy Day’s Catholic Worker Movement’s campaign for social justice. Sellars mirrors this simply but powerfully in the choral mime of praying women and brutal policemen.Otherwise the force is with Jesus, whose agony is rivetingly enacted by dancers Michael Schumacher and Anani Sanouvi, while his words pass between a trio of mostly close-harmony countertenors, as in El Niño - Daniel Bubeck, Brian Cummings and Nathan Medley, all superlative – and a tenor verging on the heroic. Russell Thomas’s Lazarus takes on the Christ role in a climactic aria at the end of Act One set to Primo Levi’s wonderful poem Passover. The emotional release is akin to Oppenheimer's “Batter My Heart” in Adams’s Doctor Atomic, but utterly different in its pace and more inward feeling. Thomas’s strenuous moment of heart-pounding anguish comes in Jesus’s reproach from the cross to the father who has abandoned him.Adams asks for extremes from his singers. In both Kelley O’Connor and Tamara Mumford he has found mezzos who come close to the late Lorraine Hunt Lieberson’s extraordinary intensity and who effortlessly produce the contralto notes so often called upon. His finest achievement is to micromanage the curves of emotion which, while they may occasionally ease, never let the listener sit back for a moment. A self-effacing Dudamel and a sleek LA Phil seemed to have it all in the palms of their masterly hands. Yet despite beautifully crafted solos from O’Connor and Mumford in Act One, echoed in what has become hallmark writing for wind and brass solos since the First Lady's exquisite aria “This is prophetic” from Nixon in China – Whitney Crockett’s bassoon solo to reinforce Mary Magdalene is unforgettable – Act One’s tone is edgy and anxious, which may account for the religious zeal I found so uncomfortable.The second act not only justifies its predecessor with heightened symmetries but rises to greater, perhaps the greatest, heights. The opening choruses, performed with incredible energy and clarity by the Los Angeles Master Chorale, knit the anger of their Death of Klinghoffer counterparts with the new level of angst in El Niño’s climactic Mexican/biblical massacre of the innocents. The Calvary procession, tense from its thrusting bass lines, is as compelling as the equivalent in James MacMillan’s masterly The World’s Ransoming. Trombones ferociously ricochet off Barbican walls, muted strings pour down rainfall in a haunting nocturne, and at the heart of the agony unison woodwind take up a slowly unfurling lament that goes beyond the more static tune of Adams’s Naïve and Sentimental Music.Yet the much more subdued – and this time oddly believable – miracle of Christ’s reappearance in the garden (angels in the sepulchre pictured above left) was always going to be the biggest challenge. Adams and Sellars chart it with spellbinding eloquence, nearly consonant chords shifting to bring the focus back to Mary and her revelation. “The chill of grace lies heavy on the morning grass” sings Goodman’s Chou En-Lai in a similar moment of transcendence at the end of Nixon in China. That Adams has carried that transcendence off so differently three times – at the ends of Nixon, El Niño and now The Other Mary – would be quite enough to earn him a place among the immortals.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/gospel-according-other-mary-los-angeles-philharmonic-dudamel-barbican-hall,5
546,"Imago, Glyndebourne Opera",Imago,Glyndebourne Opera,2013-03-11,Roderic Dunnett,"Imago, Glyndebourne’s latest Community Opera exercise, putting the cap on 25 years of pioneering educational outreach, is one of those operas where you need to read the programme synopsis first. Or maybe not. Its complications are outweighed by the fabulous impact it makes. The triple-level-set (shades of Birtwistle’s The Last Supper and other bumper enterprises at Glyndebourne) is arresting, and brilliantly capitalised on; the projection visuals - cyberspace gone crazy - are stunning; the choreography is refined, and astonishing for a community effort. You may come out with your head reeling, or banging, for a number of reasons, but the overall impact is undeniably superb.Composer Orlando Gough, a minimalist (at least here) who understands that the genre means variation and diversity, not repetition, has been paired by Glyndebourne (whose last Community Opera was Julian Philips’s and Nicky Singer’s considerable hit Knight Crew, in 2010) with a team that delivers pure magic.Librettist Stephen Plaice (a Birtwistle collaborator, as it happens), designers Ed Devlin and Bronia Housman, director (and former Cherubino) Susannah Waters, who make their designs mean something and the story add up to a lot (she even helped Richard Jones to make Weber’s Euryanthe take off at Glyndebourne) are the other brains behind this show. And video designer Finn Ross, whose credits for dazzling theatre projects are a mile long (ENO’s The Death of Klinghoffer; the RNT’s just-launched Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time, Théâtre de Complicité’s The Master and Margarita at the Barbican), gives the show such explosive thrust that, if you can’t make head or tail of what happens in Part I, or feel like blocking your ears from the shattering saxophonic onslaught, what the hell.The truth is that Imago is fascinating whether you can catch the words or not. Like Glyndebourne’s hip-hop opera, it’s a bit eager to trade on what’s in and cool. Gizmos are all the rage, and a thoughtful medic (occupational therapist actually, the wonderful Daniel Norman, who couldn’t give a bad performance in anything if he tried), comes up with the idea of technology making it possible for old and ill people to reconnect with their own actual, or imagined, past. In short, they can become as if young again. Cue miraculous neon facemasks, tendril cyber connections that look like a fervid human brain, eye-dazzling backdrop effects not recommended for those unkeen on flash photography, and a sort of electrification of the entire cast. This is a very busy, and buzzy, opera.The delight, rather than the surprise, is that it comes off so well. It’s true that Gough scores when he’s a bit less frenetic. One wedding scene with a restrainedly wacky black preacher (George Ikediashi - terrific) and a yearning acappella chorus confirms how notably and memorably his mainly tonal patter impacts when it’s not scampering (not to say that his scherzo passages aren’t pretty knockout).Two bolshy schoolboys, members of the therapist’s family, who’ve somehow got in on the act by surreptitious surfing, are pure joy. The marvel is that they both have characterful voices, broken (James Brock's Rufus manages to create his own alter ego as a romantic hero) and unbroken (Flint Pascoe-Easterby's Rory whose doubtless spiffing alternate number was Raefn Webber). Brock’s is impressive even for a young sixth former: a voice that has somewhere to go. And if someone isn’t lining up little Rory (either) for Britten’s Miles before it’s too late, that someone needs his/her head examining. Steely young Flint would sure enliven the centenary.The boys’ bickering was so good because Susannah Waters’ direction, here as everywhere, was so precise, so clever. How the Norman family (mum included) managed all the jabbing gestures and bitchy interweaving, both vocally and visually syncopated, seemed a marvel.Christopher Tudor, the movement director, strikingly experienced in coordinating youth and community work, presumably had a commanding role in all that. He certainly achieved wonders with young and old alike in this straining-at-the-leash, passionate amateur choir. Even the roulette game that launched Part II (""on the red"") – as nerve-racking as that in Tchaikovsky’s The Queen of Spades, with vast roulette wheel looming above (courtesy of Ross) - was a meticulously controlled set-piece, soloists’ voices emerging from the bunched chorus with amazing lucidity. There were many such visual near-masterpieces in this edge-of-seat, densely dramatic evening.But if one applauds the community performers (the brilliantly positioned hospital patients not least), around whom this whole exercise centred, the principals must have their due. Norman, concerned, empathetic, principled, dedicated, brings quality and a wondrous tone, often but not always light, to everything he touches. Soprano Jean Rigby, who sung the old lady Elizabeth, whose young past is part replayed, part idealised as the main ingredient of the plot, brought an intensity to this give-it-a-go old timer that was quite staggering, and in a way, it made the show.Her younger, or imagined younger incarnation is Lisette (Joanna Songi), a super young performer with a voice well on the way to being something special and somehow a presence to match. There was something very flesh and blood about this performance. Adam Gilbert, as the garish aspiring pop idol (Gulliver) whom she teams up with, and who is in some way an idealised or gooey-eyed self-projection of the wily boy Rufus, seems more of a cipher even when he marshals the crowd in a G8-type insurrection; but the ringing baritone voice is really something for a young singer only just out of studies at the Guildhall; he too is on his way.Other principals - there were several additional leads in the supporting cast - helped keep the flames fanned; and Lee Reynolds’ vocal training set every single chorus afire. But the real long-suffering heroes in this scorching performance were the strings, brass, woodwind, percussion and quite dominant imported saxophones - four or five of them - of the Aurora Orchestra, conducted by Nicholas Collon. What an impact they have made in the short time since he founded them.Imago demands quite a large orchestra. Gough could not have asked for better defined, or more evocatively coloured, playing, or more intelligent conducting of his exhaustively twirling but exciting score, than from this young award-winner or his keyed up, fabulously rehearsed instrumental team.Stagings come and go, but Glyndebourne Opera is first and foremost about the music. This magnetising collective soiree managed to do it proud. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/imago-glyndebourne-opera,5
547,"Simon Boccanegra, English Touring Opera",Simon Boccanegra,English Touring Opera,2013-03-09,Roderic Dunnett,"Simon Boccanegra has, as English Touring Opera’s director James Conway points out, never quite made the running outside Italy amid Verdi’s output. It went through three to five different versions in a short space of time. Despite the Romeo and Juliet era setting (14th-century Genoa battling it out with Venice) there are naivetes in Piave and Boito’s plot which, despite the frenetic story’s many merits, generate more than the usual operatic implausibilities. These render some of the quickly changing political frummeries all but comic, so that Otello and Falstaff tend to make better running amid post-Don Carlo Verdi.Conway has had a go at sharpening the opera’s dramatic and political intensity by relocating the action of Boccanegra to modern times (just as his Donizetti The Siege of Calais seeks affinities with wartime Stalingrad). This has merits, though Boccanegra’s dottier misunderstandings or non-recognitions seem even less plausible – even ludicrous - in an age of quick communications.The era chosen is one of appalling Italian political violence – the period of Andreotti, Togliatti and the assassinated Aldo Moro; tensions between communist-socialist left and nearly neo-Fascist right; and the ruthless two-way slaughter by the Red Brigades and their rivals (Bologna station bombing, Moro’s maimed body found in a car boot).As an evocation of that era, from the Jonathan Miller Rigoletto-like, Mafioso-style plottings of the opening scene, it does rather well. A major asset – some might disagree violently – is the immovable pillared set, with shades of Mussolini-type architecture, by the immensely gifted Faroese born set and costume designer Samal Blak, a Linbury-prize winner with a background in sculpture (it shows) and from Central St Martins.Once Craig Smith’s Boccanegra, after a curiously unprepossessing prologue, becomes leader, he spends a lot of time stuck on a central placed curule chair, in which he finally expires, poisoned. The effect is static, almost monolithic. And I found it wholly apt, magisterial, impressive. There is something Lear-like about Boccanegra’s dilemmas, and his failures, and the grizzled Smith (unconvincingly young at the immediate postwar outset) has an isolated look - political, familial, emotional - which Conway strives to underline.The fact that Smith has (unknowingly) lost, before the action starts, his wife or lover, daughter of his enemy (the always robust but now vocally magnificent Keel Watson) and then almost carelessly mislaid his baby daughter (the glorious Elizabeth Llewellyn, in a ghastly, ill-designed turquoise skirt that never changes and annoys at every turn - pictured above right), only underlines his comparable failure, or rocky efforts, to hold the creaking state, and its shifting allegiances, together.The librettists spare us Shakespearian onstage battles – no Macbeth and Macduff: revolution breaks out and then simply concludes - so we never see Boccanegra with teeth bared, sword (or Kalashnikov) in hand. Smith remains a stern, angry but strangely placid leader, accepting his end (it’s a long death) a bit like Derek Jacobi’s Claudius swallowing the poisoned mushroom.So this is a Boccanegra you will love or ridicule. A plonky prologue is redeemed by the magnificently cast Polish bass Piotr Lempa in a small(ish) role and the Australian-born Grant Doyle. Doyle is a number one performer, as Simon’s estranged former ally Paolo, who pays with his life for a collapsed coup. The opera picks up with Act I, and the story – Conway likens it to fairy tale or fable and is in many respects right – despite its twists and turns is no more complicated than Shakespeare.It might be interesting to view Boccanegra, for a change, as a comedy, which would ease its problems when presented as acute tragedy. With rivals reconciled, lost daughter/granddaughter/ maiden (the sensuously-voiced Llewellyn) restored, and her rebellious fiancé (the former rebel Gabriele – the edgy but increasingly impressive young Royal Academy tenor Charne Rochford) appointed Simon’s successor, the story ends happily; even if he, the old era yielding to the new, gracefully and honourably expires. Think of this Piave-Boito Genoan mini-saga more as The Comedy of Errors, with a tinge of Romeo and Juliet or Measure for Measure.Keel Watson’s Fiesco (Boccanegra’s enemy and, unbeknownst to him, his father-in-law), burly and lumbering but seething with emotion and justifiable outrage, is an extraordinarily touching performance, possibly the best and most intense I’ve seen Watson do to date (and he is a powerful Pizarro and pretty funny Papageno.) Rated as far away as David Pountney’s Bregenz Festival, Watson is one of the signal and significant UK operatic stage performers of our day. No matter he can look a bit stolid: this man has unique presence; a quality which to my mind Boccanegra himself also has, even though to some Smith could look merely cardboard and wimpish.All the characters, battling, disgraced or reconciled, or (in young Maria/Amelia’s case) almost comic strip-innocent, are vastly enhanced by the work of Ace McCarron, constantly employed because one of the supreme lighting designers on the circuit. Honed by engagements with two sizzling companies - Maxwell Davies’ The Fires of London and Michael McCarthy’s Music Theatre Wales - McCarron can produce the most unnerving effects with the minimum of tweaking. His lighting here worked restrained but creative wonders on Blak’s set, with its dirty beiges rising up into swathes of seaweed-green, fusing with the square-jawed Mussolinian columns.Simon Boccanegra expires, and so does the opera, to an expressive vision of the seaport he has ruled over (a small model boat nestles backstage like some understated Aldeburgh beach-wreck), and of his beloved never-to-be bride. At that point, Blak’s imagery proved its point to perfection. This production, whatever its occasional touches of bathos, has consistency and cohesion; and that’s as important a quality in a director as anything.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/simon-boccanegra-english-touring-opera,4
548,"Written on Skin, Royal Opera",Written on Skin,Royal Opera,2013-03-09,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"It’s hard to put one’s finger on why George Benjamin’s new opera doesn’t work. It comes to Covent Garden with a wind in its sails. Its outings in Europe have all received high praise. It boasts a classy cast, Martin Crimp as librettist and Benjamin at the helm of the orchestra. The story is a captivatingly horrific medieval morality tale that often goes by the title of ""the Eaten Heart story"". And there’s little wrong with Katie Mitchell’s production.On one level Written on Skin explores a simple ménage a trois, in which a loveless couple allow a stranger – an illuminator of manuscripts – into their lives and have their lives turned upside down by him. On another it’s about the dangers of inviting an artist to hold up a mirror to your circumstances. Will you like what you see? There are echoes of things like Theorem by Pasolini and Pelléas et Mélisande by Debussy, and, in Jon Clark's lighting, Tarkovsky and Caravaggio.It is sophisticated in the way that it allows one’s sympathies shift. Christopher Purves is anyway too clever an actor to let the oppressive husband Protector to remain a basic villain and one quickly starts to empathise with him – in spite of his vileness – as one witnesses his wife, Agnes (Barbara Hannigan), lusting after the artist stranger (Bejun Mehta) and finally succumbing to him. Vicki Mortimer's sets complicate things in a good way. One half of the modernist doll’s house we look into - the half housing the couple – is quasi-medieval, the other – where intervening angels and their helpers work - 21st-century. Interesting questions arise from this juxtaposition, as it appears that fantasy is housed in the modern world and reality in the medieval.And one can't fault the singing. All three principal voices offer a beauty of tone that beguiles. Purves and Hannigan, especially, use their timbral beauty to elucidate character in a masterclass of nuance and understanding. And both bring a bodily flexibility to this vocal plasticity that means that it is hard – even when other elements are conspiring against us – to gainsay what's going on on stage.All that was needed to give life to this is a decent score. And while we got a clever score, one that attended to all the superficial needs of the libretto – sultry music here, loud and dramatic music there, pseudo-medieval touches there, all alluringly teased out by Benjamin on the Royal Opera House podium – we were short-changed on melody and emotion. You only have to read the interview with Benjamin in the programme notes to see why. Fear pervaded this first attempt at a full-scale opera from Benjamin. Fear of realism. Fear of the audience. Fear of quotation. Fear of modern opera's ability to sustain interest.The result is music that feels hemmed in, that tiptoes around (almost literally in the extended pizzicatoing). It's careful, neat, safe, po-faced music (he's always stumped by Crimp's humour) that dutifully hangs on every word, confirming its dramatic or psychological meaning, but rarely if ever adding anything more to it. It’s a score low on inspiration and high on pedantry.There are scenes that work well. The slow-motion chase - husband after wife - in the last few minutes, the spectral sound of a glass harmonica wafting up from the pit, makes for a terrific finale. But this is music that goes only skin-deep.Follow @IgorToronyi on Twitter",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/written-skin-royal-opera,3
549,"Phaëton, Les Talens Lyriques, Rousset, Barbican Hall",Phaëton,Les Talens Lyriques,2013-03-09,David Nice,"Excess of light and heat sends sun-god Apollo’s son Phaeton tumbling from his father’s chariot. The light was iridescent and the temperature well conditioned as peerless Christophe Rousset led his period-instrument Les Talens Lyriques and a variable group of singers through a concert performance of Lully’s 1684 tragédie-lyrique, a specially pertinent, heliotropic operatic homage to le roi soleil Louis XIV. That there was never a dull moment probably owed more to Rousset’s extraordinary if always tasteful animating gift as both conductor and harpsichordist than to the work itself, sensitive to dramatic mood changes but not often stepping into the realm of the extraordinary.Lully was certainly capable of that, as we know from Rousset’s performance and recording of an earlier experiment mixing highly-charged recitative, big choruses and dance, Bellérophon. Phaëton certainly has its moments, though. After a frivolous prologue complete with ubiquitous toadying to the King, strings plunge us into the sudden gravity of Egyptian princess Libye’s plight, with an immediate touch of class in the shape of exquisite soprano Sophie Bevan. All-seeing Proteus’s sombrely coloured prophecy of Phaëton’s fall injects drama into the Act 1 curtain; a dance to conclude Act 2 that could blissfully have gone on for ever makes playful work of the chaconne form with its repeated (in this case chromatic) bass, while the three winds that whisk Phaëton up to see his dad are duly delineated. All is weightless in Act 4's light opening chorus of Apollo’s time-marking courtiers.Expect the kind of graphics for the arrogant young man’s fatal journey that Saint-Saëns later provided in his brilliant tone poem, though, and you’ll be disappointed. The highlight of the last act is a moving duet for Libye and the man she must forsake to marry Phaëton, his rival Epaphus (a sometimes over-forceful but stentorian Andrew Foster-Williams, good fun in the spat between the two men). We wait for the peripetaia, and it’s over in a flash, as is the opera. Why? Probably because the original stage machine for showing Phaëton’s demise was so spectacular, as Lindsay Kemp told us in his crisp programme note, that Lully didn’t need to do anything with the music.What keeps us company elsewhere, especially as the silly love-story wrapped around the Phaëton myth takes time to unfold, is the superbly-moulded nature of the French recitative that constantly bursts into heroic (or tragic, or merely dramatic) arioso. Philippe Quinault's libretto keeps a dignified balance between clarity and sententiousness, and Lully, who would declaim the verses to catch the melody in them, knows exactly what to do with it. The finest exponent in terms of both tone colour and text was the regal Ingrid Perruche (pictured above) as Phaëton’s ambitious mother Clymène. Urgency, but not beauty of tone, came from the paint-stripper voice of Isabelle Druet as Phaëton’s not-enough-beloved Théone.Emiliano Gonzalez Toro’s only just steady enough protagonist had the right ring for vaunting ambition, but it was a bad idea to match him with another, paler tenor possessed of a rather peculiar technique, Cyril Auvity, as a less than divine father. Benoît Arnould’s Protée needed the lower bass notes that Matthew Brook possessed in abundance. But the real fluent pleasures came from Rousset’s ensemble, sounding silky-gorgeous in the Barbican Hall – how much better this venue suits a smaller, period ensemble than a big symphony orchestra – with the cellos especially rocking the bass line where necessary, and the supremely cultured Namur Chamber Choir. Rousset could take charge of the telephone directory and we’d probably listen with just as much pleasure. May they come back soon.Watch Rousset and Les Talens Lyriques in the complete Phaëton at the 2012 Beaune FestivalRead David Nice's blog, I'll Think of Something Later ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/pha%C3%ABton-les-talens-lyriques-rousset-barbican-hall,4
550,"Worden, BBC Concert Orchestra, de Ridder, Queen Elizabeth Hall",Worden,BBC Concert Orchestra,2013-03-04,David Nice,"Who’d have guessed a full house for the third of The Rest is Noise festival’s Berlin nights? This time there were no obvious superstars, unless you follow singer-songwriter Shara Worden of My Brightest Diamond and you know the impeccable track-record so far of young conductor André de Ridder. The programme of three very different composing voices from the Berlin of the early 1930s was not a crowd-puller either; yet the audience of mostly twenty- and thirty-somethings even stayed and cheered for Hindemith’s Mathis der Maler Symphony, perhaps enticed by the promise of an after-interval encore from Worden.The order was right. De Ridder fluently guided us from the uningratiating 12-tone angst of Schoenberg’s Accompaniment to a Film Scene to the discombobulating mix of nostalgia and nihilism in Weill’s The Seven Deadly Sins, all of this miraculously purified by Hindemith’s celebration of the artistic spirit’s survival in dark times.The programme parallelled Thomas Dausgaard’s BBC Symphony Orchestra programme last week in taking three works only a couple of years apart; the conducting matched Dausgaard’s in never putting a foot wrong. De Ridder (pictured right) also turned presenter as engagingly as Jurowski in London or Nelsons in Birmingham. Here was a BBC Concert Orchestra immediately transfigured in the eerie atmospheres and muscly conflicts of the Schoenberg. But how would more of the same in the more audience-friendly context of Weill’s inverted morality tale mesh with the miked voice of Worden?Very poignantly, as it turned out. Petite Shara as Annas I and II, the hard-nosed and morally upright sisters who are really a single person as they sing their wayfarer songs on money-making tours of seven American cities, sported a black and white ying-yang dress, moved stylishly and knew how to make the most of the props in her travel-bag. She sang in English (the not always well-fitting Auden/Kallman translation). The voice is mostly soft-grained and vulnerable – no trace here of Worden’s operatic training – but that drew us in hypnotically to the banjo- and clarinet-accompanied Louisiana prologue. Synergy Vocals as the male, barber-shoppish quartet representing her avaricious family, backed up by savage strings, provided the bite; as Anna and the folks back home collide in parallel universes, the dramatic level rose a notch or two.Supertitles labelling each adventure would have been welcome; without action, the bourgeois take on each ""sin""  – pride as self respect, anger for railing against injustice, lust as love, for instance – wouldn't have been clear to all. Worden recapped vibrantly, though, in the militant credo before Anna’s final breakdown. Intimations of Björk suggested another possible performer for this still-pertinent little masterpiece.The postponed encore Worden wrote herself made sense, too: “We added it up” is also about the opposites that make the world go round, a catchy and varied song with a touch of Kate Bush in the vocal line. Full orchestral accompaniment, with the players eventually turned backing group, couldn't rival the chamber original (see the YouTube version below), but there was nothing gauche about this sophisticated number.Hindemith’s symphony, parallel to his very great opera on the life and work of that towering Renaissance artist Matthias Grünewald certainly plunged us into another world – its maze of counterpoint clean and clear, strings dancing and searing against brass choruses utterly convincing in their majesty. Hindemith takes three panels from Grünewald’s masterpiece, the Isenheim Altarpiece in Colmar (pictured above; go see it, worth the trip), and boldly asserts a never saccharine religious majesty and stillness against malign forces, parallel to the Nazi opposition he was then facing. It was a resplendent and very un-decadent conclusion to this strand of the Southbank’s 20th-century music festival.Watch Shara Worden perform ""We added it up"" ",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/worden-bbc-concert-orchestra-de-ridder-queen-elizabeth-hall,4
551,"The Threepenny Opera, LPO, Jurowski, Royal Festival Hall",The Threepenny Opera,LPO,2013-03-03,David Nice,"Given a fair few strange and languishing Brecht-Weill pieces that The Rest is Noise Festival’s Berlin strand might have explored, Vladimir Jurowski and the LPO had a tough time of it by piecing together a performing edition of the most familiar one. Stagings of Die Dreigroschenoper with singing actors and a deft director can knit this celebrated hybrid together. But a concert performance that tries to be true to the 1928 premiere’s mixture of balladeers and fairly hefty opera singers to fill out the updated, jazz-meets-Bach riff on John Gay’s thieves-den Beggar’s Opera will be very lucky to hit all the targets. Here there were three outstanding performers in an ensemble that was otherwise only quite good.The band was beyond reproach. You could hardly call it the London Philharmonic Orchestra, since only 10 of the regular players were involved, fleshed out with saxes, bandoneón, banjo, mandolin, guitar and Hawaiian guitar (Nigel Woodhouse, consummate). Jurowski coaxed them into the sharp-edged spirit of it all, the more prominent lines punched out into the vasts of the Festival Hall. Mark Templeton muted his trombone to play the lounge lizard, and Catherine Edwards, zipping between a whispering harmonium, celesta and a piano which Jurowski occasionally commanded at whim, rattled through the histrionic accompaniment of Lucy Lockit’s arch vengeance aria. Soprano Gabriela Istoc put it across with fair conviction, but Brecht and Weill’s operatic parodies aren’t as good as Gilbert and Sullivan’s, and hardly more abrasive either.Lucy and Polly Peachum are at loggerheads over justice-evading gangster Macheath, “Mack the Knife”, who has a bride or a whore in every part of south-east England. I wasn’t expecting Mark Padmore to quite deliver a lethal cut, but he managed well enough given this unorthodox context. Narrator/ballad singer Max Hopp (pictured right by Karl Giant) – confident, genial-sarcastic and excellent with the guttural rrrs in the hit song – set up the scenes, so there was no Brechtian dialogue for any of the singers to bring their characters to life. Ted Huffman’s clean, minimal direction, had them all as black-clad automata who only come to life at the moment they burst into song.Padmore did a good job with the insouciant thuggishness and the mock romance, less so with the heldentenorish demands of the Act 2 finale, “What keeps a man alive?” Felicity Palmer's Frau Peachum brought Frickaish authority to bear on her verse, though, and combined line with text to deadpan perfection in the “Ballad of Sexual Bondage”. As her beggar-king husband, John Tomlinson laid it on thick with bass-like authority, not always quite nimble enough to keep up with the orchestra.The star of the show, though, was the versatile Allison Bell as Polly, the faux-naïf teenager who falls for a bit of rough. We got two versions of “Pirate Jenny”, since this soon devolved in the late Twenties to Lotte Lenya’s chief whore. Anarchist cabarettista Meow Meow (pictured left by Gregor Bard), vampish to the point of self-parody, delivered it with a smoky slink that lacked the very lowest notes needed at that pitch. Her version wasn’t a patch on Bell’s perfect mix of speech-song with light-soprano sweetness. After all, Bell knows her Schoenberg Pierrot Lunaire – and she turned herself out as imaginatively as ever, like Louise Brooks as Lulu. That’s style for you. On the wish-list, then: a Seven Deadly Sins with Bell as opportunist Anna and Jurowski conducting, maybe with a less familiar Brecht-Weill one-acter to keep it company. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/threepenny-opera-lpo-jurowski-royal-festival-hall,3
552,"The Barber of Seville, English National Opera",The Barber of Seville,English National Opera,2013-02-26,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"There is only one rule by which one should ever judge a Barber of Seville. If your eyes (and possibly also your trouser legs) aren’t moist by the time the interval arrives, you might as well leave. The last time this Jonathan Miller production was revived by the English National Opera, it passed with flying colours. This time round, I was dry as a bone. Three hours and I notched up two smiles and a snigger.There’s little wrong with designer Tanya McCallin’s set-up, traditional and 18th century though it all very earnestly is. It’s all neatly tailored to allowing this smooth-as-clockwork Rossini farce to unravel with most efficiency and least fuss. There’s little wrong, superficially, with the conceptual shaping either. The merry-go-round of Figaro and Count Almaviva’s attempts to woo Rosina and then steal her from her guardian Doctor Bartolo is inflected with a moral bankruptcy in this revival that reveals the angrier political concerns of the original Beaumarchais play.And the singing was effective enough. Lucy Crowe (Rosina) warbled with an especially attractive colouring and hit her many fusillades across the stratosphere with consistency and musicality, maintaining an appropriately crazed look as she tried to control her madcap reality. The rest were efficient and effortless. Benedict Nelson was perhaps a bit too effortless as Figaro. Andrew Kennedy makes a sound that some have been known to enjoy – though not me. Andrew Shore just about stayed on top of his rapid-fire lines as the Doctor. And Katherine Broderick was a bubbly Berta. Conductor Jaime Martin’s debut went by without mishap.Still, fine singing, delicate concepts, mishap-free conducting, faithful period sets and costumes, do not a decent Barber make. Carefully sculpted comedic detail was what we wanted and far from what we got. Unusually for ENO, poor casting was to blame. Nelson may have a nice méchant streak that suits the wheeler-dealer side of Figaro well but he has little of the light-footed cheek that is necessary to inject the double, then triple, act with Almaviva and the Doctor with humour as well as class tension. Andrew Kennedy, meanwhile, who was unconvincing in some of the most rudimentary human activities – wooing, falling in love, being drunk - is the opposite of an actor. He dissipates energy. Whenever he comes on, your eyes instinctively drift to someone else. It’s an unhelpful quality to have in a leading man. The only performer who elicited anything approaching a laugh from me was the great Andrew Shore. Yet even with him, the comedy didn’t seem half as funny as I remembered it. The comedic details were resurrected in a cruder form. Blackadder had become the Chuckle Brothers. It shows you how unimportant the director of the original production is if the revival director refuses to follow the original director’s intent. “Everything that is considerable can be found in the negligible”, is Miller’s famous mantra. Here, both the considerable and the negligible were merely negligible.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/barber-seville-english-national-opera,2
553,"The Cunning Little Vixen, Welsh National Opera",The Cunning Little Vixen,Welsh National Opera,2013-02-25,stephen Walsh,"Janáček’s opera subjects – the 300-year-old opera singer, the composer with a mad mother-in-law, the Siberian prison camp – are by any standards a fairly rum collection. But The Cunning Little Vixen is arguably the most deviant of the whole bunch. Its foxy heroine (out of a Prague newspaper cartoon strip) is captured by the local Forester, lectures his hens about their subservience to the Cockerel, slaughters the lot of them, runs off, marries, starts a family, then allows herself to be shot by the poacher. All very charming, random and pathetic, one might feel. But Janáček typically has other ideas, and the result, though not supremely operatic, is one of his most thought-provoking and touching stage works.“Stage work” is a good, cautious description. As a vocal score Vixen is distinctly problematical. Uniquely for his operas, it has page after page of purely orchestral music, to which Nature dances, in the form of assorted forest creatures, dragonflies, mosquitoes, squirrels, frogs – a whole bestiary of buzzers, flutterers and nibblers. The fox tale itself is a very light brush. Through it thread the menopausal ruminations of a handful of ageing villagers: the schoolmaster, the priest, the poacher, and above all the forester, for whom the vixen he pursues is somehow a symbol of vanishing youth and potency. Life draws to a close, but Mother Nature recycles. In her end is her beginning; in our end is our end.So Vixen plays on a number of levels. Nature is red in tooth and claw, sometimes, but the agony is also exquisite; and Janáček’s dance music captures this evanescent delicacy with an unblinking precision devoid of false sentiment, light in touch, occasionally dark in undercurrent. David Pountney’s production, now more than thirty years old, was always dazzling to the eye, thanks in large measure to the inventive wit of the late Maria Bjoernson’s anthropomorphic costume designs and the perilous brilliance of Stuart Hopps’s choreography, over what might be a slice of rough ground from a Welsh hillside. In Elaine Tyler-Hall’s revival, it all pops up as fresh as its forest setting.For the singers, human or animal, life is not so carefree. Sophie Bevan, as the Vixen (pictured right), makes characteristic light of music that, even when sung in Czech, makes the words dance more than it lets them sing, and that here, in Pountney’s new English translation, often seems to lie awkwardly on the voice. She gives, all the same, a vibrant, personable, acrobatic performance, with her lovely, easy production, and surprising agility about the stage. She reminds us, too, of her fine command of a brand of ecstatic lyricism, in her love scene with the Fox – a nice, stylish performance by Sarah Castle which doesn’t, nevertheless, quite convince me that Janáček was right to make him a soprano (to distinguish him, I suppose, from the galumphing, oppressively male human characters).They in turn have few opportunities to sing out as they stumble myopically round the natural world. Jonathan Summers acts a plausible Forester, but his voice these days is on the dry side and lacks the warmth to lend his final apostrophe to nature the eloquence it deserves. Richard Angas provides a neat cameo of the priest with a clear conscience but a roving eye, Alan Oke is the dull schoolmaster still, in his dotage, regretting his gipsy love, David Stout the poacher who gets the girl and (with his shotgun) the Vixen. But Janáček wasn’t generous to them with his music; he warmed more to the male animals, the Dog (Julian Boyce), the Cockerel (Michael Clifton-Thompson), the Badger (Laurence Cole) – a series of memorable vignettes.No advantage is taken of Janáček’s offer of part doublings, and as usual WNO crowd the stage with sharply observed individual performances, not least by children and dancers, too many to itemize, all excellent. Lothar Koenigs conducts, with a finesse worlds away from anything called for by Lulu, in its final performance the previous evening. And the orchestra switches style no less deftly, leaving aside minor issues of balance. For them the whole season has been a triumph.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/cunning-little-vixen-welsh-national-opera,3
554,"Medea, English National Opera",Medea,English National Opera,2013-02-16,alexandra Coghlan,"How do you solve a problem like Medea? Euripides’ baby-killing, hell-invoking sorceress is one of literature’s most terrifying and unfathomable creations – a woman capable of murdering her own children just to watch their father’s pain. Yet with the blood on her hands now centuries-old, Medea continues to work her grim enchantments on artists. No fewer than eight operas (and an almost equal number of plays) have staged her story, but have any really got to grips with the psychology of tragedy’s wickedest witch? I’m afraid that Georg Benda’s 1775 Medea is unknown to me, as is Saverio Mercadente’s 1851 work of the same name, but in Marc-Antoine Charpentier’s 1693 Médée composers have a template for music-drama at its purest and most vital.With 2011’s Castor and Pollux English National Opera nudged a door ajar that has been closed on British stages for centuries. The baroque revival of the past few decades has been vigorous and ubiquitous, so long as your surname is Italian, or Handel. But the French baroque music of Lully, Rameau and Charpentier has remained exiled from the opera house, banished for its difficulty and dramatic otherness.""Connolly's Medea is at once magnificent and horrifying""Freed from the recitative-aria conventions of Handel and Vivaldi, French composers enjoyed a much more fluid and dramatically sensitive form, drifting from dance to arioso to duet without the chains of the da capo aria to weight it down. It’s this freedom – at its most extreme in Charpentier’s Medea – that lends itself so naturally to those complex, cumulative emotions that struggle against the confines of Handel’s conventions.Beauty here doesn’t come framed in a 10-minute aria, it has to be sought out in the detail: an unexpectedly thickly-harmonised cadence in the strings, a tugging appoggiatura that clings just longer than expected, a false relation that grinds the ear underfoot. Christian Curnyn conducts the ENO orchestra, coaxing a beautiful if sometimes rather muted blend from his contemporary strings and adding period colouring with some plangent work from recorders and theorbo.There will be those who would condemn the extended dance episodes to the chop, but dance is the heartbeat of French baroque and (barring some intrusively noisy footwork) is generously served here in a full-length masque and froths out of the drama throughout. Some of it is decidedly camp (director David McVicar seems briefly to stray into Jonathan Miller’s Mikado with his cavorting naval officers) and the Busby-Berkeley-meets-MTV cabaret won’t be to everyone’s taste, but Lynne Page’s choreography does ensure that all movement, however anachronistic, grows organically from the music. It’s a huge improvement on the recent calisthenic horrors of ENO’s recent Julius Caesar.McVicar returns to his baroque roots here in a production colliding eras and worlds that is the natural heir to his Alcina or Agrippina. An 18th-century apartment finds itself requisitioned for use by the entire Allied forces of the 1940s, the fading shell of a gilded oligarchy hosting an invasion of privileged, patriarchal thugs. Plus ça change. Bunny Christie’s gloriously stylised costumes offer decorative contradiction to this era of emancipation in which the women still prance around in pencil-skirts and stilettos, gyrate in sequinned hot-pants, or waft fragrantly about in virginal white – fantasy-fodder for the military men.A power-suited Sarah Connolly (pictured above right) stands apart. Her Medea chafes against the confines of her role and gender, exploited then discarded at the whim of a libidinous husband. Vocally dwarfing her colleagues, her struggle to repress herself into this world of social hierarchies is mirrored visually and musically. Forging her own path through Charpentier’s fluid tempo-transitions and moods, she never lets her hand slip from the psychological string that guides us through the endless corners and corridors of recit. Her miniature aria of grief once Jason’s abandonment is certain coaxes tears, while her final invocation of the forces of Hell partners that earlier fragility with a reckless blood-lust. We feel for her, even as we know the small, pyjama-clad bodies are coming, and in her final ascent (not descent, interestingly) to darkness she is at once magnificent and horrifying.Roderick Williams’ Orontes (brilliantly styled as a Lord Flashheart-esque RAF pilot) leads the supporting cast with swagger and glossy tone, balanced by the brighter colours of Jeffrey Francis’s Jason, whose characterisation sits more comfortably than his highest register, and whose rhythmic sensitivity occasionally wavers. Katherine Manley’s Creusa (pictured left with Francis as Jason) is a Hitchcock blonde with daddy-issues, channelling Grace Kelly circa To Catch a Thief in her styling and sparring intriguingly with Brindley Sherratt’s Creon. Hers is the most blossomy of the various excellent soprano voices on show (Rhian Lois’s Nerina also deserves mention), finding airy spaces for ambiguity and personality in her delivery. Her duet with Sophie Junker’s Phantom II is a highlight, as is her glorious death-duet with Francis.The pace may take a while to pick up (and that with a huge cut early on), but once underway Charpentier’s Medea has all the momentum of its Greek original. The music won’t satisfy melody junkies or those craving high-wire coloratura thrills, but for social and individual psychology it leaves Handel still puzzling over the instruction manual for assembling his Freudian couch.How do you solve a problem like Medea? Ask ENO – they seem to have found the answer.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/medea-english-national-opera,5
555,"Madam Butterfly, Welsh National Opera",Madam Butterfly,Welsh National Opera,2013-02-16,stephen Walsh,"Last week Lulu, this week Cio-Cio San, next week the Vixen Bystrouška. These are the three exemplars of David Pountney’s “Free Spirits” – as he labels his first themed season with WNO. But it’s hard to see poor little Butterfly, pinned to a board by the cruel American sailor-lepidopterist, as a free anything. Like a trapped fly, Suzuki calls her; and if there’s a free spirit in Puccini’s opera, it might rather be Pinkerton himself, “dropping anchor at random,” as he boasts to Sharpless: not such an inspiring thought.Joachim Herz’s production, now 35 years old, was rough and aggressive when new. I remember apologising to the American friend I saw it with for its brutal anti-Americanism. In those days WNO sang it in English and the politics were direct. Now, in Italian, it has a softer edge and there is no monkeying with the words, though the music is a hybrid of Puccini’s various revisions (three acts, but no “Fiorito asil” for Pinkerton).It now seems a model production, beautifully rehearsed by Caroline Chaney, stylishly Japanese when required in the first act, cleverly westernising later as Cio-Cio San practises being Mrs.Pinkerton. Reinhart Zimmermann’s delicate sliding screens are ideal as design and perfection as a practical, mobile setting, bearing in mind that this is an opera in three acts but only a single set. Chaney complements them with cleverly managed stage movement and telling, sensitive groupings, expressive of the culture clash which – if Madam Butterfly is anything but operatic soap – is both the landscape and the cause of its tragedy. The chorus work, as ever, is excellent (chorus pictured below).In keeping with all this, the revival is strongly acted, perhaps less strongly – though certainly not weakly – sung. Cheryl Barker is convincing as the coy, simpering schoolgirl of the first act, slightly less so as the teenage mother of Acts 2 and 3, but a thoughtful, versatile vocal actress nonetheless, only somewhat short on colour in the voice, not quite able to flood the sound with emotion at key moments. Gwyn Hughes Jones is likewise more monochrome than recently at ENO, stylish but without great warmth in the voice, careful though to avoid caricaturing this irretrievably mindless if not unfeeling (listen to his music) Yankee fantasist.It’s tough on Pinkerton that, after the exquisite duet that ends the first act, he more or less vanishes, along with most of the other characters, leaving Butterfly and her Suzuki, touchingly done here by Claire Bradshaw, to hope and mope alone, with occasional visits from the ever-optimistic marriage broker, Goro (Philip Lloyd Holtam, very polished). Alan Opie’s Consul struggles up the hill from Nagasaki now and then, helpless rather than Sharpless, an exact vignette: but he too gets little music after Act 1, which one regrets here as always. Instead Puccini offers cameos: the Bonze (Julian Close, a fine but brief rage), the suitor Yamadori (Alastair Moore), and above all the silent Trouble (are there such children?), a remarkable début by Jacob Adams, son of the orchestra’s leader.Hard to improve on any of these, or on the orchestra itself, under the French conductor Frédéric Chaslin: refined playing after their more robust brilliance in Lulu, with just a slight tendency to cover the singers – not usually a Puccini problem.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/madam-butterfly-welsh-national-opera,4
556,"La Voix Humaine/Dido and Aeneas, Opera North",La Voix Humaine/Dido and Aeneas,Opera North,2013-02-15,graham Rickson,"“All we do is talk!” complains the unnamed protagonist in Poulenc’s brilliantly concise one-act opera La Voix Humaine, a faithful setting from late on in the composer’s career of Cocteau’s 1930 play. Banter is what you don’t get; the heroine’s dialogue with her former lover is conducted via an unreliable landline. The audience hears only one side of the conversation. It’s a chilling, emotionally charged piece – though the latent naturalism is slightly undercut by the unseen presence of a full orchestra underscoring every move.Poulenc’s irrepressible warmth and melodic gifts are largely downplayed, though having the telephone’s ringing suggested via a trilling xylophone is a witty touch. Poulenc saw the piece as autobiographical, and the edginess is disconcerting. This is a revelatory new production, the opera’s poignancy and caustic humour brilliantly highlighted. Lesley Garrett’s performance is good enough to silence any naysayers – time spent treading the boards in West End musicals has sharpened her acting skills and clarified her diction. She’s wholly credible; trembling nervously at the start, chain-smoking and passing the receiver shakily from hand to hand.While director Aletta Collins’s background as a choreographer ensures that all her characters move with conviction, it is especially telling with Garrett’s simplest moves – pulling off her wig, stubbing out a cigarette. And her voice, though not enormous, is in good shape, only occasionally overwhelmed by Poulenc’s sporadic louder tuttis. Garrett is at her best in the opening moments, Garrett successfully negotiating every twist and kink while never sounding forced. She sounds more hesitant and uneasy as the work proceeds, nicely mirroring her character’s physical collapse. Only Collins’s visual effects jar slightly. They’re ingenious and deftly achieved, but add little, spelling out crudely what Cocteau and Poulenc achieve so subtly through words and music. Still, this is a welcome chance to savour a minor masterpiece from an underrated composer. But, at 40 minutes, what do you programme it with?Opera North have chosen another one-acter featuring a forsaken heroine: Purcell’s Dido and Aeneas. It sounds ravishing – lutes and theorbo in the orchestral pit producing bewitching sounds, while the chorus, as usual, is terrific. But Collins’s direction left me baffled, if beguiled, with dancers acting as doubles for Dido and an overabundance of female cast members wearing thick red lipstick, identical ginger wigs and black nightdresses. What should be lucid and easy to follow becomes obtuse and slightly maddening. At certain points you feel you could be watching an oblique take on the video to Robert Palmer’s “Addicted to Love.”And yet as a series of beautiful tableaux this Dido and Aeneas is mesmerising. The recycling of props, costumes and gestures from La Voix Humaine is cleverly done, and the set’s clean, uncluttered lines provide an effective backdrop. Pamela Helen Stephen (pictured above right with dancers and witches) and Amy Freston as Dido and Belinda are flawless, though my favourite moment was Nicholas Watts’s sweetly eloquent “Come away, fellow sailors”. Wyn Davies conducts both works with affection. An uneven night, but an enjoyable one.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-voix-humainedido-and-aeneas-opera-north,3
557,"Orpheus in the Underworld, Opera'r Ddraig",Orpheus in the Underworld,Opera'r Ddraig,2013-02-13,stephen Walsh,"Since I last reviewed Opera’r Ddraig (no longer offered as Dragon Opera in their publicity) two years ago, this company of students and postgraduates has moved house, and this year is staging its main show, Offenbach’s delightfully absurd Orpheus spoof, in the cavernous old Coal Exchange down by Cardiff Bay.It isn’t a happy move, and I hope won’t be permanent. The Exchange is a high, flat hall with, of course, no orchestra pit, and the show’s director, Imogen Tedbury, has put up a steeply terraced stage which makes for excellent sight-lines but badly inhibits stage movement, entrances and exits, scene changes, and all the other amenities of the kind of proscenium theatre Offenbach wrote for.The result is a somewhat inert, congested stage picture, in a work that, like most French operetta, needs speed and movement to disguise its dramatic vapidities. Admittedly Orpheus in the Underworld is a rather superior example of the genre. It soothes irritation at every turn with an exquisite melody or a satirical idea so witty that one quite forgets to find it ludicrous. And in the same way, there is so much that’s good about the performance of these young singers and players that one happily overlooks the problems the production and the venue impose on them.Outstanding in the first of the two casts is the Eurydice of the young Irish soprano Emma Nash (pictured right), still a student at Opera’r Ddraig’s parent establishment, the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama. She has a lovely silvery quality, excellent control in the upper regions, good support lower down, and a vivid stage presence. In many ways she dominates the production, and thoroughly deserves her extra Act 2 couplets from the longer revised 1874 score, which gets a fairly generous outing altogether in this performance. Mercury’s saltarello is a specially welcome guest in the second scene, dispatched with terrific verve by Roland Harrad, who somehow manages to sing and chassé through the milling throng.The rest of a large cast are never less than solid, often better than that. I particularly enjoyed Matthew Clark’s Boris Johnson lookalike Jupiter, his face lit by a sweetly helpless smile as his thunderbolts fail to go off; and Matthew Tilley’s superbly vulgar John Styx, pinching his own bottom as he reminisces about his kingship of Beotia. The big – perhaps too big – chorus sing and can-can with enthusiasm rather than huge discipline, but the orchestra under Calum Fraser is excellent by any measure, and Fraser himself catches the style of music that often eludes Anglo-Saxon conductors.This is a show that generally maintains the high musical standards Opera’r Ddraig set themselves from the start. But they need to find a venue that enables production values on the same level. At the Coal Exchange they are crowded into a knife-edge, sauve qui peut style of making do and having a good time. For students that may be OK, but on the brink of the profession it doesn’t quite cut the mustard.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/orpheus-underworld-operar-ddraig,4
558,"Die Meistersinger Act Three, Hallé, Elder, Bridgewater Hall, Manchester",Die Meistersinger Act Three,Hallé,2013-02-11,philip Radcliffe,"The “Mastersingers of Manchester”, about 350 of them, were gathered together by Sir Mark Elder to celebrate the Wagner bicentenary with this performance of Act Three of Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg in its entirety. He also pulled in about 200 orchestral musicians, exploiting the city’s resources just about to the limit.Sir Mark even broke into song himself in the build-up to the main event. With the help of his assistant conductor Jamie Phillips and soloists and young musicians, some only 12 years old, from the Hallé Youth Orchestra and Chetham’s School of Music, Elder set the scene with excerpts from the previous two acts in entertaining style. And his singing (light tenor) was better than one might have expected.For the main event, the Hallé orchestra and choir were bolstered by choristers from the RNCM, Chetham’s and the University of Manchester. Sir Mark, a man for the big occasion, has a way of harnessing resources. He also has a way with Wagner. He counts his acclaimed concert performances here of Götterdämmerung and Die Walküre in the past four years as the high points of his 12-year reign. And he has the distinction of having conducted Die Meistersinger at Bayreuth as far back as 1981.Act Three of Meistersinger, lasting two and a quarter hours, is the joyous climax to the comedy, with much jollity and no little drama as the Meistersinger contest reaches its happy denouement, bringing the young knight Walther and the goldsmith’s daughter Eva together at last. There’s nothing comedic about that hypnotic, long, dark opening on lower strings, caressed by Elder. Then in comes Sachs, the cobbler poet, sung with power, warmth and clarity here by Iain Paterson, to get Midsummer’s Day up and running.The trouble with concert performances is how much play-acting goes on. Much depends on the individual soloist, and the most characterful here was the irrepressible Christopher Purves, making the most of Beckmesser, the town clerk everybody wants to cut down to size. There he is, strumming his lute (actual sound provided by a Celtic harp in the orchestra), tripping over a rostrum and playing up to Sachs with misplaced bravado in an ill-fated hope of winning the song contest – and the prize of the goldsmith’s daughter, Eva.The piece is crammed with goodies. The young knight Walther’s love song to Eva, supposedly written from his dream about a beautiful woman, has a haunting melody, which becomes his signature tune, expressively sung by the German tenor, Daniel Kirch. And his Eva was finely portrayed by Emma Bell, who has a big rich voice and real stage presence. Then there is the “joyful morning” quintet just before the final scene, in which Sachs, Walther and Eva are joined by the cobbler’s apprentice, David (Allan Clayton) and his lover Magdalene (Sarah Catle). A real highlight.The final scene opens with exuberant music signalling all the festive fun of Midsummer’s Day, before changing seamlessly into the opera’s familiar processional theme as the Mastersingers come on parade (through the audience), like a graduation ceremony. At last the choirs came into their own with a shattering “Awake! Day draws near” and then “Hail to Sachs”. He, in turn, answers modestly, but famously urges them to “honour your German masters”. If all else should be lost, holy German art will survive (Richard Wagner, pictured above).This was another impressive and ambitious achievement by Elder. He steered the orchestral playing and the singing of the massed choirs with exhilaration and sensitivity, and the audience responded with a rousing standing ovation. I particularly liked the way in which Elder drew a parallel between the young musical “apprentices” of Manchester, who hope to become “masters”, and those of Nuremberg, celebrated here.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/die-meistersinger-act-three-hall%C3%A9-elder-bridgewater-hall-manchester,4
559,"Radamisto, English Concert, Barbican Hall",Radamisto,English Concert,2013-02-11,alexandra Coghlan,"The Barbican is London’s home for baroque opera in concert, regularly bringing Europe’s finest over with their latest Handel and Vivaldi. But although fresh from a performance in Paris, last night’s band were definitely home-grown. Harry Bicket and the English Concert were joined by a dream-team of soloists for a performance of Handel’s Radamisto that suggested their French rivals aren’t going to have it all their own way this season.Radamisto isn’t first-tier Handel; its uneasy combination of tragic extremity and quick-fix dramatic resolution render it inadvertently comic, whatever you do with it. But among a shaky framework there are some stand-out arias – Radamisto’s crooning “Qual nave” and “Deggio dunque”, Polissena’s “Barbaro!” – as well as one of the most joyous pantomime villains of opera in Tiridate. Xavier Sabata’s CD has recently reminded just how much fun Handel’s bad guys can be, and there was no doubt from his lowering and petulant storming that Luca Pisaroni was enjoying himself mightily, and taking his audience along with him.Supreme character-singer though he is, Pisaroni couldn’t quite steal the show from Elizabeth Watts’ Tigrane, flinging herself gamely at da capo embellishments and coloratura with complete conviction. A bland warrior became a plucky underdog in her hands, wooing Brenda Rae’s Polissena with more dramatic detail than David Alden’s entire fully-staged production at English National Opera mustered a few years back.With many of the evening’s singers either veterans of staged productions or preparing for them, drama was very much to the fore investing David Daniels’ Radamisto with a lived-in familiarity. Although often pushing forward through his coloratura and lacking focus in his middle range, Daniels (pictured right) is still a force to be reckoned with at the top. His is a voice made for rage and high passions rather than the purity of some countertenors, though his “Cara sposa” was memorably fluid and his “Ombra cara” da capo a shadowy, barely-breathed thing of beauty.No one writes a tragic mezzo like Handel, and no one sings one quite like Patricia Bardon. Her Cornelia (Giulio Cesare) is unsurpassed, and here she brought all her gravitas and darkly-shaded vocal colouring to Radmisto’s faithful consort Zenobia. Clear and sweet by contrast, Brenda Rae’s Polissena sparred joyously with Pisaroni – a voice worth following for the future.Bicket’s quiet continuo style might be in contrast to the more flamboyant approach of Laurence Cummings, but there’s no questioning the results. With only two desks of strings, the English Concert brought chamber precision to Handel’s orchestral score, their fiery outbursts gilded by cameos from pairs of trumpets and horns, and obbligato moments from oboe and cello bringing plangent loveliness to contemplative arias.It would be hard to imagine the opera better played, and with such sung drama for its cast this is a performance crying out for an opera house to give it the home it deserves.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/radamisto-english-concert-barbican-hall,4
560,"Lulu, Welsh National Opera",Lulu,Welsh National Opera,2013-02-09,stephen Walsh,"What-ifs and might-have-beens are usually as pointless in music as in any other walk of life. Still one can’t help wondering how Alban Berg would have completed – and, no less interesting, revised – his opera Lulu, if he hadn’t been stung by some philistine insect in the summer of 1935 and died of the resulting septicaemia that Christmas Eve, with the last act unfinished and barely half-orchestrated.Berg’s earlier opera, Wozzeck, is taut and perfunctory, like the Büchner play it’s based on. Lulu, a setting of a pair of wordy plays by the proto-expressionist Frank Wedekind, is brilliant, prolix, endlessly fascinating, maddeningly confused and over-complicated. David Pountney’s dazzling new production for WNO, his first for the company since becoming its intendant, feeds enthusiastically on the work’s excesses, makes little serious attempt to sort out its muddles, but accepts it as the basis for a spectacular and unforgettable show, stunning to look at, shattering to listen to. Berg’s score is nobody’s easy ride: not the audience’s, certainly not the singers’ or players’. Yet the packed house clearly adored every long minute, and happily left their comprehension at the door.The plot itself is simple enough. Lulu (the Earth Spirit of Wedekind’s first play) is a femme fatale who works her way through every man (and the occasional woman) she encounters: a sort of girl Don Juan whose path, though, is strewn with the corpses of her discarded lovers. In his final act set in a London garret, Berg, who was obsessed with symmetries and hidden structures, brings back the prostitute Lulu’s husbands as avenging clients, the last of whom – the newspaper tycoon Dr.Schön reconfigured as Jack the Ripper – knifes her and her lesbian hanger-on to music last heard when she had murdered him an act-and-a-half earlier.The problems begin with the profusion of minor characters, and continue with the rambling verbosity of the libretto, which Berg himself drew more or less directly from Wedekind. Already in the first two long acts there are entire characters whose sole purpose seems to be to demonstrate that Lulu exerts her power over all sorts and conditions of men, from princes to footmen, athletes to intellectuals, schoolboys to transsexuals.There then follows, at the start of the third act, a long and elaborate scene in a Paris salon which brings in seven or eight completely new roles and a profusion of fresh incident, largely irrelevant to the main narrative. Friedrich Cerha, whose completion of the final act has become standard, accepted this scene pretty much as Berg had drafted it, but Pountney and the conductor Lothar Koenigs have preferred a recent adaptation by Eberhard Kloke which compresses it into a kind of mobile form that allows cuts and simultaneities and speeds it up out of all measure. Lovers of textual purity are unlikely to applaud this device; lovers of good music theatre can only sigh with relief.Pountney himself seizes on strong hints in Berg to turn this dramaturgical jungle into a visual and theatrical delight, marvellously designed by Johan Engels, Marie-Jeanne Lecca and Mark Jonathan. The menagerie of Wedekind’s prologue becomes a motif for the whole production, spawning some unforgettable animal masks and coloured costumes, if not always clarifying the action. Pountney picks up the merest Wagnerian hint in Wedekind’s title, Erdgeist, to link Lulu as Erde to her elderly tramp/lover Schigolch as Wotan, the Wanderer with a slouch hat and a patch over one eye. The mind boggles at where this parallel might lead the wandering interpretative mind; but luckily its attention is soon distracted by other matters.David Pountney has never balked at sexual innuendo, and Lulu gives his predilection full and legitimate rein. The stage is strewn with anatomical detritus. Weird mannequins, all legs and buttocks, are caressed and manipulated, Lulu and the lesbian Countess Gewitz are discovered on a vast couch in the form of what looks like a grotesque naked body, and at the end of this scene Lulu herself – the wonderful Marie Arnet – completely disrobes to reveal something a good deal less grotesque. One shudders to think how this sequence might be revived in future times and places. But sufficient unto the day… Above all, WNO is now blessed with an artistic director with strong musical genes. Pountney can read a score and knows how to manoeuvre singers on, off and around the stage with an ear to the pace and texture of the music. With all those characters constantly coming and going, Lulu is a death-trap for the usual cloth-eared opera director. But this staging hardly puts a foot wrong, for all the complexity of Engels’s fixed, shop-window set, an enormous chromium gantry round a central spiral staircase, up and down which exits and entries have to be – and are – timed to perfection. As a stage presentation of Berg’s music, what Wagner called deeds of music made visible, this could hardly be bettered, whatever the obscurities of narrative detail.At the centre musically are Arnet’s impeccably stylish, bravura performance as Lulu, and some stupendous orchestral playing under Koenigs. To call Lulu a difficult part would be like calling thirties Berlin an interesting city; not only is she on stage for almost the entire evening, but she has constantly to relate to each one of her motley array of fellow-characters, and withal she has to sing the most intricate coloratura in a complex musical idiom, while debasing herself morally, moving elegantly, and generally looking nice. There have been some – not many – great Lulus. Marie Arnet is surely one of them.From the very first trombone theme, you know you’re in for a thrilling evening. The sheer sound of the orchestra in the prologue is as fine as anything I can remember in an opera pit, and Richard Angas’s Animal Tamer (later also Schigolch) is direct, resonant, utterly arresting. The enormous cast has hardly a weakness. Especially memorable are Julian Close’s Acrobat, a role hard to define but musically rich, Mark Le Brocq’s cleverly sung, wittily acted Painter/Negro, and Ashley Holland’s Schön (pictured above with Arnet), a sort of Berlinesque Citizen Kane, substantial in voice, physique and presence.Peter Hoare’s Alwa, also very well sung, is perhaps too frail in portraiture; Natascha Petrinsky is a fine, watchable Geschwitz, a part, though, that is musically disappointing until her wonderful curtain lines at the end. Alan Oke’s villainous crocodile-Marquis is the one real positive among the thickets of the Paris scene. Patricia Orr copes well as the Schoolboy, a Cherubino role with, alas, not much Cherubino music. The rest is company work, brilliantly handled as always with WNO, polished and precise in every detail. It’s good to see them back on a creative track after those barren years.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/lulu-welsh-national-opera,5
561,"Joyce DiDonato, Il Complesso Barocco, Barbican Hall",Joyce DiDonato,Il Complesso Barocco,2013-02-07,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"It may look like a sure-fire hit to let Kansas mezzo Joyce DiDonato rip through the drama-queen repertoire of the Baroque. But last night’s exploration of the dustiest, most overgrown byways of 17th and 18th century Italian opera needed every drop of DiDonato’s star musical talents – not to mention those of her backing band Il Complesso Barocco – to convince us of the worth of these rarities. The audience bought it. I remain on the fence.Prepared in conjunction with that great scholar of this period, Alan Curtis, the concert didn’t disappoint in certain key respects. In mood, narrative flow and emotional variety, the programme was pretty impeccable. As was DiDonato. Her resonant, creamy voice was well suited to the lusty opener, Intorno all’idol mio (""Hover around my beloved""), from Antonio Cesti’s Orontea. She was matched every step of the way by Il Complesso Barocco, who, between verses, would carry forth the sultry tumescence exquisitely.Via a typically turbo-charged piece by Domenico Scarlatti (the overture to Tolomeo ed Alessandro), the orchestra rocketed us to a more complicated number from Monteverdi’s L’incoronazione di Poppea, Ottavia’s breadown, Disprezzata regina (""Despised queen""). This delicate bit of word-painting is musically on the other end of the scale to most of what was on offer, and requires a very different set of vocal skills. DiDonato had to work hard to control and slow the generous flow of her sound to be able to deliver the ornamentation. But control it she did. And when she did, the passaggi flowed with real feeling - something period specialists often lack. More heartfelt tenderness followed in Germiniano Giacomelli’s Sposa, son disprezzata (""As a wife I am despised"") from Irene, an ode to the battered wife, an aria made famous by Cecilia Bartoli. DiDonato engaged an emotional narrative drama where Bartoli offers a textural one. It was more traditional and beautiful but no less piercing.Then, temporarily, the queen was deposed. The usurper? Principal violinist Dmitry Sinkovsky (pictured below). It was a short but electrifying reign. His eyes spinning, his legs jiving, his body staggering about the stage like a drunk, Sinkovsky scurried around his instrument like a man possessed. Every bit of extended technique Vivaldi's score allowed him was deployed, turning the instrument into a one-man percussion band and the Concerto for violin and strings, RV242, into something phantasmagoric.Anything you can do… DiDonato returned to regain her crown with a saucy number from Giuseppe Maria Orlandini, Da torbida procella (“I am tossed like a ship”), colouring the narrative with coquettish little legatos, switching from head to chest, from chest to head with ease. A cheeky, sexy end to the first half.For the second, bigger battles, bigger dresses. Cleopatra was up first. Ignore the fiery pride of the words of Johann Adolf Hasse’s Morte col fiero aspetto (“Death’s grisly aspect holds no horror for me”); the music told a different story – one of fragility and fear – one DiDonato was all too capable of telling. We’d had glimpses of DiDonato’s sotto voce earlier in the evening but only with the Handel (Piangero la sorte mia) did it appear in all its spectral beauty.She does the luxurious stuff so well, it’s easy to forget what a delicate thing her voice can be when hushed to a sotto, or mezza, voce. Both flicker with a vulnerability born of a delicate vibrato. This came out in the Ifigenia in Aulide aria from Giovanni Porta, Madre diletta, abbracciami (“Dearest mother, embrace me”). Her soft enunciation of the opening Madre was a masterclass in musicality. A smattering of Gluck (ballet music from his Armide) gently escorted us to the close, a coloratura-packed Handel aria from Alessandro, Brilla nell’alma (“My soul is trembling”).All in all, a tremendous night for the performers. Reservations, however, remained about the value of certain compositions. The word-painting's always a little pat in this second-rate Italian repertoire. I can’t deny that I would have preferred to hear DiDonato traverse a single masterpiece by a single composer rather than several middling works by several middling composers.A mention for Christopher Cook’s superb programme notes, a virtuoso traversal of the period itself. I loved listening to DiDonato talk at the end. Until I didn’t - too much Will & Grace, too much talk of the lousy Vivienne Westwood and her lousy dress.Follow @IgorToronyi on Twitter",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/joyce-didonato-il-complesso-barocco-barbican-hall,4
562,"Eugene Onegin, Royal Opera",Eugene Onegin,Royal Opera,2013-02-05,David Nice,"Studying Russian for three years to read Pushkin’s verse-novel Eugene Onegin in the original doesn’t guarantee the finest interpretation of Tchaikovsky’s equally great lyric homage. Yet it certainly seems to have focused the imagination of Covent Garden’s new Director of Opera, Kasper Holten, and allows him to inflect every move his characters make with the right emotion.His basic premise begins at the end: with the older, more dislocated Onegin and Tatyana aching their way back to that time in a mid-19th century adolescence when happiness was so close. That makes it clear at the start that the approach is going to be nearly as non-realistic as veteran Peter Konwitschny’s ENO Traviata. The difference here is that the unforced articulation of every feeling goes straight to the truthfulness at the heart of Tchaikovsky’s masterpiece. Holten’s team of singing actors is equal to the challenge; Robin Ticciati’s conducting and Wolfgang Göbbel's lighting of Mia Stensgaard’s clever, singer-helpful set follow the fluctuations with painstaking sensitivity.The “doors of memory” idea isn’t quite new: Stefan Herheim explored it in his production for the Netherlands Opera. While the paths these two directors then take are very much their own, it helps in both cases with the Tatyana, Krassimira Stoyanova. So many Onegins are unbalanced by a soprano who has the lirico spinto backbone for the final scene but sounds and/or looks a little mature for the impressionable teenager. That’s true of Stoyanova, but in this context her unhoneyed but extremely malleable voice, the expected Bulgarian grasp of perfect diction for the Russian text and arrow-to-the-heart gestures all work well.Her younger self is a dancer, Vigdis Hentze Olsen: inevitably a little stylized for Pushkin’s and Tchaikovsky’s candid 17 year old. Her observation by the singer in the opera’s most famous scene, Tatyana’s penning of an impulsive love-letter to the attractive visitor who’s made such an impression, takes some getting used to. Yet this Tatyana for once is able to write when Tchaikovsky says she should, and the plangent moment at the core of the opera when Tatyana helplessly wonders whether Eugene is angel or philanderer, is simple and affecting, the woman holding the girl in a tender embrace. Ticciati, who’s kept the pastoral opening scene delicately on the move, gives the oboe solo and its sequel all the space and flexibility they need: crucially great conducting at this point.Not that the first act belongs entirely to Tatyana, as it so often does. Simon Keenlyside’s Onegin (pictured right) is very much present from the start thanks to Holten’s central conceit: then his young man is puppyish on arrival at the Larin country estate, not the usual aloof dandy, clearly attracted to Tatyana rather than her sister Olga. Is he role-playing, still unsure of himself, when he hands her back the letter? The production leaves it vague, but at least makes us feel for him.Clearly this pair is well suited, as Katrina Lindsay’s costuming makes clear: Tatyana’s flaming, impassioned red, setting the wood outside her window ablaze, stands out alongside Onegin’s bright blue. Every number for the black-clad chorus underlines the conformity from which these two are exempted, though Holten makes sure we’re never too aware of set pieces: the little ditty sung by Olga (Elena Maximova, with the right Russian contralto colouring), dressed in more pastel shades like her suitor and Onegin’s friend Lensky (Pavol Breslik), reveals that she’s too unstable to sustain the role of all-singing, all-dancing sister to the bookish Tatyana. Breslik, handsome of figure and clarion of voice, starts out by reading his declaration of love to her very much in front of Tatyana and Onegin, but sets the script aside as the Russian impersonal second-person switches to the intimate “you”.By dividing the opera into fluid scenes rather than acts, and having the calamitous name-day party before the interval, Holten shows us how quickly all this youthful charm and impulsiveness can go wrong. With the choral guests in block dance formations, the anguished youngsters are always in view: dancer Tatyana crouched in a cupboard, the singer very much to the front of the stage.Breslik’s lightish tenor is pushed to the limits when Lensky explodes at Onegin’s outrageous flirting with his girlfriend, but the spat has shocking immediacy and the poet’s farewell aria (Breslik pictured left) could hardly be more nuanced. A snowstorm rages beyond the windows, courtesy of 59 Productions’ Lawrence Watson, for their duel. Keenlyside’s anguished presence as young Onegin presses ahead with the senseless ritual makes the tension almost unbearable. He holds his young friend in desperation as his former self could not, mirroring the two Tatyanas' embrace in the letter scene. That awesome let’s-stop-this-foolishness duet of asides has never worked more powerfully than with old Onegin and young Lensky side by side.Lensky’s corpse remains onstage for the last two scenes. Onegin now truly takes over the reins both in a Polonaise of discarded, heartbroken lovers and a monologue in which Ticciati works with Keenlyside on more detail and colour than we’ve ever been allowed to hear before in what is usually a cursory summing-up of what's happened over the intervening years. Lights up on a Petersburg ball, heavy black crinolines as expected. Maybe the “fat general” Tatyana has married is a human being, too: the light blue sash to Onegin’s now darker shade colour-codes as much. Peter Rose (pictured below with Stoyanova, Keenlyside and Breslik) unsettles us with the mixture of barely-restrained violence towards the wanderer and tenderness to his wife: the great aria brings the most magisterial singing of the evening, absolutely regal with inspired phrasing of the “ray of sunshine” that Tatyana has brought to Gremin’s life.He’s present, too, for the last third of the desperate final encounter, explaining why Tatyana turns from submission to Onegin’s pleas to a declaration of her intention to honour her marriage vows. It’s almost a step too far for Keenlyside’s beefed-up baritone, but he pulls it off and – yes, we feel deeply for him at the end.Every minor character is real and pointed, from Diana Montague’s now-familiar Madame Larina and Kathleen Wilkinson’s authentic nyanya to Christopher Mortagne’s elegant French birthday versifier and Jihoon Kim’s duel-seconder Zaretsky, Ticciati bringing out the military strain in his little solo as I’ve never heard it before. They all create a world for the lost lovers to inhabit, which is something you could never say of the ENO Traviata. Holten, unlike Konwitschny, wants to move us, to tears if necessary, and that he does with emotional chapter and verse in a palpitating manifesto for the new Royal Opera era.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/eugene-onegin-royal-opera,4
563,"La Traviata, English National Opera",La Traviata,English National Opera,2013-02-03,David Nice,"How’s a good time girl to bare her beautiful soul when a director seems bent on cutting her down to puppet size? It doesn't bother me that Peter Konwitschny shears Verdi’s already concise score by about 20 minutes to shoehorn it into a one-act drama; what goes is either inessential or among the usual casualties of standard Traviatas. The spare and economical idea of layered curtains to symbolise the characters' constriction or emancipation is good in principle, too. But so impassioned is American soprano Corinne Winters’s Violetta that to rob her of any meaningful relationships with the man she loves and the father she’s supposed to soften tears the heart out of a brilliant music-drama.There’s not much vocal shapeliness about conductor Michael Hofstetter’s chilly account of the Prelude (apart from a few surprising blaze-ups, the rest is efficient rather than ideally fluent). And we soon realise there’s distancing in Konwitschny’s initial concept: Violetta the seemingly brittle society victim gets pushed together with bookish Alfredo, a duffle-coated nerd catapulted among the DJs and silks. She can change; he can’t, according to Konwitschny. Country love and a dying Violetta leave him as stiff and awkward as ever. There’s no real ardour, no real anger or regrets for poor Ben Johnson (pictured with Winters in the final scene below) to latch on to. Still, this young British tenor is a real asset for ENO – probably more for Mozart and Britten than Verdi or Puccini, for even this lightish role is a bit of a stretch at the top for him.Konwitschny thinks we’re more likely to believe in Violetta’s sacrifice for Alfredo’s convention-bound father if the daughter she’s supposed to step aside for is shoved on to the stage as a harrowed, pigtailed schoolgirl: the courtesan might do her best for another downtrodden female. This, though, makes father Germont so much the irredeemable bully that the shifting dynamics of the great duet at the heart of the opera go for nothing (and what’s with the gun Violetta pulls towards the end?) Anthony Michaels-Moore (pictured below), after an unsettled start on the first night which found him hectoring the smoother legato lines, is the genuine Verdi-baritone article, and sings his romance of attempted consolation to the devastated Alfredo with real style. But his character remains as one-dimensional as his son’s.For Corinne Winters, there are the same obstacles to creating a real human being. In an uneasy balance between stylisation and naturalism, every move seems phoney: drag the curtains here, jump off the chair and collapse there. Which is a terrible shame because, although hers may not be the most individual of voices, she fills it with intensity and can do everything Verdi asks: the coloratura hectic flushes of the determination to carry on with the high life at the end of the first scene, the lirico spinto ability to pull out the vocal stops for the big, desperate phrase of “Love me, Alfredo” and the curving lines of anguish in the second party scene, the tenderness of the too-late last love duet.That final scene ushers in another problem for Winters, though. The red curtains of Johannes Leiacker’s effective designs work well; it’s certainly a bold moment in Konwitschny’s “Scene Three” when, in a fast moving party scene thankfully free of rhe usual gypsies and toreadors, Alfredo’s violence in the big confrontation sees all the red drapes pulled down, the chorus crashing to the ground only to crawl off and leave the heroine to her endgame. That leaves a black curtain at the very back of the stage against which Violetta has to deliver the aria we know as “Addio del passato”.It’s a measure of Winters’s emotional projection that we can still hear her with her back to the audience and as far away from them as the all too vast Coliseum stage allows. And why can’t Alfredo and Violetta just hold each other for their simple dreams of an illusory future instead of stepping back again to try in vain to pull some invisible curtains back (you get the symbolism very quickly). The intimacy which is so strong a feature of Verdi's semi-domestic opera seems less valid than ever in this vast venue.The last image, at least, is strong: the Germonts and hapless Doctor Grenvil singing from the auditorium, Violetta reaching out from the stage before stepping out of the circle of light and into the blackness beyond. But after a too-solid Mimì (Maija Kovalevska) in a Covent Garden Bohème which is as conventional as the Traviata there – time for a change – here was a second consumptive heroine who couldn’t make us shed a tear. And this time we had a soprano who was perfectly capable of doing so in the right circumstances. If you want to see a German regietheater re-think which works, watch the DVD of Willy Decker’s Salzburg production with Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazón. Although none of the smaller roles made much impact at ENO, the company should be proud of fielding a pair of lovers not too far behind that starry couple; it’s just a shame that Winters and Johnson have a director who works against them.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-traviata-english-national-opera,3
564,"Mattila, Hampson, LPO, Jurowski, Royal Festival Hall",Mattila,Hampson,2013-01-20,David Nice,"This may have been the official, lavish fanfare for the Southbank’s The Rest is Noise Festival, which if the hard sell hasn’t hit you yet is a year-long celebration of 20th Century music in its cultural context and based around Alex Ross's bestseller of the same name. For Jurowski and the LPO, though, it was very much through-composed programme planning as usual, though with a sweeping bow towards the festival theme of how modernism evolved as it did.In this case Jurowski fashioned a very selective, very long (it could have been a three-parter) and often unusual nine-year odyssey for Richard Strauss towards the voluptuous horrors of his 1905 opera Salome. Ambition, though, for once outstripped some of the execution, with even the star singers, Karita Mattila and Thomas Hampson, finding that the vocal embodiment of Strauss’s huge demands couldn’t always match the dramatic, much as that thrilled in Salome’s final love-death.Only Jurowski would dare to place Also sprach Zarathustra, Strauss’s giddying poetic homage to Nietzsche, not only in the first half of the concert, but a first half to be shared with some of Strauss’s next steps. Premiered in 1896, It’s certainly one of those preludes to the 20th century which seems way ahead of its time, and has a special claim in that a 1902 Budapest performance turned the young Bartók back to the path of composing.You can’t get more C-majorish than the Kubrick-immortalised opening sunrise, trumpeter Paul Beniston leading a carefully graded light in each of his three famous summons. On the other hand, what could be wackier than the fugue which takes the theme through the 12 notes of the chromatic scale – the first tone-row? – as a dark meditation on the dryness of academic learning, a stage Nietzsche decided man had to pass through on his way to transcendence. This was one of the many irreproachably balanced strange sounds Jurowski judged to perfection, starting with the back row of double-basses.Yet despite all the orchestral revelations, there was none of the sweeping involvement or the jaw-dropping blazes that can churn up the adolescent in us. In short, too much Apollonian objectivity and not enough Dionysian wildness.A chilliness in the delivery wasn’t helped by what sounded like lack of ideal preparation this complex work needs, nor by Jurowski’s decision to follow the line of Strauss the conductor rather than indulgent Karajan in speeding through some of the sections, and not always taking the whole of the orchestra with him.Perhaps the rough edges were not surprising, given that more rehearsal time might have been needed for the rest of the programme: the LPO would probably not have played the final scene from Salome in living memory, and certainly not the five colossal orchestral songs that we were so lucky to hear in the concert. Of the four from Op. 33, the leisurely glow of ""Verführung"" (""Seduction"") and the hieratic calm of the ""Song of Apollo’s Priestess"", with its surprising thematic anticipation of Salome’s demand for John the Baptist’s Head, are the gems. Mattila was imposingly at home in the second, though the first showed up what has become a problem in the break between chest voice, a gauzy middle that is beginning to wobble and the still beautiful diaphanous top of the range.Hampson (pictured above by Dario Acosta) had a harder job, though proudly stepping up to a song-contest like similarly harp-announced Wolfram in Wagner’s Tannhäuser to voice his flattering Hymn. Here the low notes tended to vanish, suggesting that although Strauss stipulated a high baritone for this and the less convincing rhapsody setting Goethe’s “Pilgrim’s Morning Song”, a more bass-baritonal approach might work better.That’s certainly the case in the biggest surprise of the evening, the fully-fledged tone poem for voice, solo violin and selective orchestra Notturno of 1899. The narrative is by that same Richard Dehmel who inspired Schoenberg’s Transfigured Night, and tells a dream vision of fiddling death appearing in the guise of a beloved friend. The harmonies and the weird woodwind moonshine mark this out as one of Strauss’s most individual scores, and with Hampson supplicating a similarly standing leader, the flawless Peter Schoeman, we were witnesses to a masterpiece reborn.Side-of-stage chat between the ever articulate Jurowski and his baritone filled us in on the background, and there was an invaluable moment when the conductor told us how he had sought out a Dresden score of Salome, the only one to incorporate Strauss's changes for lighter sopranos than Marie ""Auntie"" Wittich who sang in the premiere, for cues as to how to ease the burden for his own singer.Even so, the only perfect performance of the evening came in Salome’s Dance of the Seven Veils - its wrapping round of airy sensuousness and lurking threat deliciously held in fine balance, its teasing characterfully launched by oboist Ian Hardwick and a fabulous guest principal flautist, Clara Andrada. Jurowski (pictured right by Chris Christodoulou) floated the waltz-strains begun in the Superman’s Dance of Zarathustra, reminding us that in the real world they were about to tumble into the abyss.Which we could palpably envisage as Salome peers into the cistern awaiting Jokanaan’s head, that queasy pinched, high double-bass note insisting on her anxiety. There could have been no more vivid start for Mattila’s instinctive dramatic artistry, and though she was bathed in a horrid pinky-red light which gave her bad sunburn, her acting out of the teenager’s necrophiliac lovesong astounded. What we saw was not always what we heard, though: pushing some of the upper notes towards an alarming sharpness, her knife-thrust gestures only complemented the cutting low notes.By force of her sheer will-power, though, you could almost believe there was more focus to the swimmier rest of the voice than actually emerged. In the opera house, any reservations would by this stage be totally suspended; but the concert platform is a less enveloping world, and vocally this wasn’t the ideal Salome by some way. Most of the audience, however, clearly felt otherwise and were on their feet – a fair tribute to an undeniably great artist. Five stars for audacious programming and showstopping denouement, then, but only, reluctantly, three (and a half) for the results.Watch Karita Mattila deliver Salome's final scene (minus the anticipation) in the 2008 Metropolitan Opera production now on DVD",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/mattila-hampson-lpo-jurowski-royal-festival-hall,3
565,"The Minotaur, Royal Opera",The Minotaur,Royal Opera,2013-01-18,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"Flesh-tearing, woman-raping, body-goring brute he may be, but he's misunderstood, that Minotaur. It's a bold argument to make, but this is the contention of Harrison Birtwistle and David Harsent's 2008 opera. They are aided by a surprisingly cuddly performance from John Tomlinson. Head trapped in a prosthetic bull's cranium, hairy belly flopping out, a small stick-on penis standing to attention, Tomlinson is a reluctant and eloquent (if still pretty hideous) half-man, half-beast, soliloquising soulfully on his existential crisis (that of being treated as all-beast when he sees himself as mostly man). Less sympathy is extended to Ariadne, the Minotaur's bored gate-keeper. Her efforts to secure herself a one-way ticket off Crete by eloping with Theseus - who appears on the island with several fellow Athenians who Ariadne is quite willing to send to their deaths - is unflattering behaviour in the extreme, especially as it's born of ennui and lust. In this way she is the second half-man, half-beast we encounter and is perhaps more beastly than the beast in this rendering. No relativistic moral helping hand is offered at all to the Keres, the third half-man, half-beasts, an all-female band of vulture-like body-devourers and yelpers (immoral Valkyries essentially). But then theirs is not a substantive role but a Grand Guignol one, offering us a nicely entertaining, solidly camp close to the first act after the thoughtful to-ing and fro-ing. Theseus is as all-good as the Keres are all-bad and the worse for it. Next to the many moments of introspective downtime with Ariadne and the Minotaur, the blustery episodes with superhero Theseus (not helped by a slightly unconvincing portrayal from Johan Reuter) were tedious.But whenever the drama flagged - and there are moments of repetition or obviousness in the first half and second - one could simply sit back, watch and listen. The music didn't quite hit me between the eyes like it did when I first encountered it in 2008. I think Tony Pappano (the opera's first conductor) probably drove things harder and more dramatically than Ryan Wigglesworth. But Wigglesworth's less tempestuous approach allowed one to savour the detail. This time one could glory fully in the rich washes of orchestral colour spattered with, and shaped by, percussion. Ariadne's two or three jittery arias were particularly memorable, as the chaos that is so often confined to the percussive subconscious (occupying two boxes on the sides) leapt into the main orchestra.The singing was very fine. Christine Rice navigated her discursive part with bel canto-like continuity and beauty, while retaining vocal muscularity and drama. She also balanced the demands of her Janus-faced character extremely well, maintaining plausibility and a sliver of sympathy even in the villainy. Tomlinson's unwilling Minotaur, his feet almost dragging in the bull ring where he is egged on by a mysterious, masked chorus (who sang with great ritualistic power) to slay his victims, was poignantly done. There was a terrific cameo from Andrew Watts as a Tourette's suffering twitcher of an androgynous oracle. Elisabeth Meister had an impressively Valkyrie-like voice, very befitting the leader of the Keres.What made the evening, however, was designer Alison Chitty and director Stephen Langridge's staging. Quiet, economical, rite-like, the activities of the characters take place under collapsable heavens that open and shut like a puppet's mouth. One sky offers the hazy dawn of the Greek islands, sun and moon slowly jockeying for position. The other is the striated cave of the labyrinth. These Cy Twombly scratches are repeated - in blood - on the walls of the Minotaur's bullring. It was everything a set should be: a perfect blend of intelligence - of subtle engagement with and echoing of the ideas in the text - and aesthetics.Greek drama and its intense gaze on life's essentials has often come to the rescue of opera at times of excess. It has so again. The Minotaur is undoubtably a keeper.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/minotaur-royal-opera,4
566,"Otello, Opera North",Otello,Opera North,2013-01-17,graham Rickson,"The overpowering nastiness of Shakespeare’s source material is offset by Verdi’s sublime, impeccably judged music; this is a wonderful opera with barely a dud moment. Trust the score, get decent singers and an understanding, intelligent conductor, and everything should be fine.The one rocky moment in Opera North’s new production of Otello comes in the opening minutes; Verdi’s storm-tossed prelude blasts out gloriously, the huge ensemble cast enter and stare boldly out into the auditorium. And yet, when the solo singing starts it’s almost impossible to ascertain where the individual voices are coming from. It’s as if the set’s been carefully, moodily illuminated, but with little consideration given to the characters populating it. Leslie Travers’ battleship-grey, Cold War era designs are an ideal physical reflection of the paranoia and mistrust at the heart of Shakespeare’s text, but you start to crave a little more colour. Happily, things improve rapidly - the lighting enhancing the action rather than working against it.For all the opera’s grandeur, its epic scale, Otello is at heart a chamber piece, its success ultimately reliant on the casting of the three leads. Ronald Samm’s Otello is a brooding, belligerent stage presence whose ability to stay one step behind everyone else is both endearing and tragic. His thunder is continually stolen by David Kempster’s manipulative Iago. Kempster’s portrayal is all sly, strutting petulance. This is a man who loves the power and status that uniform and rank bring. He also looks as if he’s gone to seed – there’s a hint of a paunch, a slightly ridiculous moustache. This is an officer who’s not been promoted for good reason. But he‘s a brilliantly insidious bully – able to undermine, unnerve with the slightest of comments. Elena Kelessedi as Desdemona acts convincingly, but there’s an occasional hint of harshness to her tone in the early scenes. She does come into her own in the final act, the Willow Song packing a punch, though her sudden, temporary revival after her suffocation by Otello caused involuntary audience giggles.Director Tim Albery always excels when he’s dealing with large forces. Here, chorus and minor roles always look convincing, the actions always look credible. The opening scene’s fight between Cassio (Michael Wade Lee, excellent), Roderigo and Montano is beautifully well-handled – singers jumping fearlessly on and off tables, the crowd of onlookers swarming around with believable fluidity. Even Albery can’t prevent the kitschy interlude involving mandolins and childrens’ chorus from appearing unnecessarily saccharine, but it does provide a smidgeon of light relief. He’s excellent at ratching up the tension as the opera nears its close, the set growing darker, more enclosed and increasingly claustrophobic. It’s a sign of a gripping production that in the final scene part of you wants to shout out advice to the beleaguered Otello, pantomime style.None of this would matter a jot if the musical values weren’t up to scratch. Richard Farnes’ conducting is as exemplary as ever, letting his orchestral forces rip in such a way as, mystifyingly, never to overwhelm the singers. Verdi’s delicate, exquisite string writing in the last act is as good as you’ll ever hear it, and there are heavenly sounds from oboes and cor anglais. You don’t often hear Verdi’s music dissected with this much care and affection – take away the cymbal crashes and piccolo shrieks and you’re reminded of what an intelligent, sophisticated composer he was.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/otello-opera-north,4
567,"La Bohème, Royal Opera",La Bohème,Royal Opera,2012-12-18,David Nice,"Rolando Villazón at 40 is back on reasonably stylish form, as far as the voice will allow him to go – which is not always up and volume-wise only just as far as the Covent Garden Balcony. John Copley’s Royal Opera Bohème is two years younger than the Mexican tenor. It burns less warmly than the faltering stove in the first act, casts a pall over collective attempts to reanimate the naturalism which is all there in Puccini’s perfect score, and needs a second interval to drag its weary bones back up the stairs to the students’ attic in Act Four.The late Julia Trevelyan Oman’s sets still have variable success. The introduction to the attic is fine, but Mimì deserves a bit of moonshine rather than a dirty greenish-yellow light to ignite Rodolfo’s passion. The big bustle of 1830s Parisian street life needs more space for the outdoor antics and perhaps less for the Café Momus (I’d never have guessed one actor was engaged, let alone 17). The snowy January scene by the Barrière d’Enfer still looks fine, though again this act doesn’t need two intervals flanking it. Some business shows sparks of life: the chucking around of lascivious landlord Benoit’s wig brings the young men together, and the last-act horseplay begins to take off. It's prefaced by the evening’s finest musical moment, the nostalgic duet for Villazón’s Rodolfo and Audun Iversen’s Marcello, dramatically as much a near-cipher as his ENO Onegin but handsomely sung with a sense of the big line.That line is broken by vibratos of varying degrees in both the girls. Maija Kovalevska’s Mimì is certainly brighter of timbre than Stefania Dovhan’s conspicuously un-flamboyant Musetta (pictured right with Iversen), though you can tell from the way Kovalevska shirks a gentle float on the word “primavera” (""springtime"") in her aria of self-introduction that the death scene won’t be touching in its softer notes. While Puccini’s restrained language of reminiscence is sensitively realized here by the Royal Opera Orchestra under Mark Elder, with the harp relishing its fine-tuned scoring, our tubercular heroine remains too clear and full for true pathos. Was there a wet eye in the house, I wonder? Many of the score’s miracles come across with exemplary clarity, but there’s surely no need for Elder to clip the wings of Puccini’s astute sentiment in slower passages.Copley’s supervision of this 26th revival fails to cement bonds between the men, though there was distinction in David Bižić’s virile musician Schaunard and Nahuel di Pierro’s scrupulous Colline. And Villazón? At times his comic semaphoring seems to be channelling Coco the clown instead of Rodolfo the poet. He stands on one leg while ripping apart his play, and hides Mimì's key in his hair (his hair?) Better that, though, than the more usual tenorial lack of response to everything going on around. His supple Italianate style, more authentic than Kovalevska’s, needs a little more complementary nimbleness from Elder and certainly less orchestral volume so that the high notes, for all their lack of abandon, can be properly heard. Warning signs loom in Act Three, where on this first night Villazón took three of his bigger challenges down the octave. That doesn’t promise well for the rest of his stint; those money notes will have to be there for the not-quite-live screening on 15 January.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-boh%C3%A8me-royal-opera-0,3
568,"Der Fliegende Holländer, Zurich Opera, Royal Festival Hall",Der Fliegende Holländer,Zurich Opera,2012-12-16,David Nice,"Much more regularly than the seven years it takes the Flying Dutchman's demon ship to reach dry land, the Zurich Opera steamer moors at the Southbank Centre. None of its more recent concert performances up to now has branded itself on the memory as much as its 2003 visit, when chorus and soloists stunned in Wagner's Tannhäuser. This one will, though: and the wonder of it is that Bryn Terfel's surely unsurpassable Dutchman, condemned to the seas for all eternity unless saved by the faithful-until-death love of a good woman, had other singers to match him.In the first act, the great Wagnerian of today was hailed and well met by a veteran legend still in good shape (don't basses go on for ever?), 67-year-old Matti Salminen as bluff captain Daland. After an unnecessary interval, foisted by the Festival Hall on a company which at home runs its Dutchman for two and a quarter hours without a break, the platform was then lit up by the Senta of Anja Kampe, one of those performers who seem to project the character's inner life with every committed breath.The great overture, Wagner's first signing-in of true genius in 1843, certainly showed off the unusual, cultured tones of the house orchestra, the Philharmonia Zurich, epitomised by the very distinctive timbre of its cor anglais. But conductor Alain Altinoglu seemed more remarkable for elegance than elemental surge, a slight reticence which vanished as soon as the stormy action got under way. The sweetest of light tenors, Schweizer from Ticino Fabio Trümpy, offered the first moment of light relief, ballasted at the other end of the act by Salminen (pictured with Terfel in the Zurich production right), a model of relaxed stage movement and resonant ease who negotiated his Italian opera buffa humour at the start of the duet with surprising agility.For deep soul, though, we had to wait for the entry of Terfel, a magnificent still presence as always, his monologue drawing us in right at the start with its hollow desolation and rising to cosmic despair with hair-raising stops pulled out at ""nirgends ein Grab! Niemals der Tod!"" (""nowhere a grave! Never death!""). For a snapshot of Terfel's art, the beginning of the second act duet couldn't be bettered: the evenness of the voice throughout the range in pianissimo demonstrated by the emotion of the opening phrase, a sliver of warmth into the silence, rising to a generous beauty of phrasing as the possibility of redemption comes to seem a reality.For all that, this was not so much a moment to admire flawless technique as to melt at a love duet in which the room truly began to spin. Much of the credit for setting that up had to go to the instantly sympathetic Kampe (pictured left with Terfel in the Zurich production), a wonderful Isolde at Glyndebourne and, as Senta, a visionary able to make her dream real in a rock-solid ballad. Her answering phrases in the duet only heightened the magic set up by Terfel, and though those first top Bs at the climax gave her trouble, the rest were brilliantly tackled and dramatically meaningful. Kampe's intonation throughout was as strong and true as her characterisation.Martin Homrich, a serviceable if rather wide-vibratoed replacement for the advertised Marco Jentzsch as her hapless suitor Erik, provided the necessary foil to her fixation. The final denouement - here using Wagner's hard-hitting original version where Senta's sacrifice results in no post-Tristan floating up to the heavens, presumably an unredeemed ending in the Zurich production - flamed in every department. Kampe electrified her final vows as Terfel generously pushed his voice to a roughness it needed here and the orchestra caught fire.As always, we marvelled at the Zurich Opera Chorus's burnished agility. Altinoglu accompanied the nimble spin-sters in Act Two with amusing dialogues between bassoons and horns, while the strange meeting of human and supernatural sailors in Act Three was as effective as it can be without the aid of atmospheric production values (though they might have experimented with the Festival Hall spaces more and put the demon crew outside the doors on a higher stalls level instead of onstage). The evening, though, belonged to Terfel, Kampe and Salminen - world-class performances which may be equalled but won't be surpassed in Wagner bicentenary year.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/der-fliegende-holl%C3%A4nder-zurich-opera-royal-festival-hall,5
569,"Robert le Diable, Royal Opera",Robert le Diable,Royal Opera,2012-12-07,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"My phone's predictive text posed an interesting question. Robert le Doable it insisted on calling last night's opera. And it's often been asked of this and other grands opéras. Are they doable? Such was the munificence of the times in which they thrived, and such has been the collapse in their popularity, are grands opéras worthy of resurrection? And do we have the resources and good will to do justice to their singular vision? If any opera company could meet the all-singing, all-dancing demands, it is the Royal Opera House. And if any of the hundreds of grands opéras that graced the Paris stage at the genre's height ought to be resurrected, it is Giacomo Meyerbeer's Robert le Diable - even though it took a couple of acts to fully realise how the piece became such an overnight sensation and century-long obsession.Indeed, if you were to judge last night on the first act you might have been confused on many fronts. Confused at the high standing of director Laurent Pelly, whose set was a mess. Confused at the plot, which raises the stakes in relational coincidence to new heights of silliness. Confused at how or why any of us were here at all, not tucked up in bed watching something half decent - and cheaper - on telly. By the start of Act Two, however, things were settling in. Here, the love story begins in earnest.Poplavskaya and Relyea made the third act and the final scene of the fifth fizz And it isn't a wholly uninteresting story when seen in the round. Marrying all the fashionable elements of early Romantic opera - medievalism, supernaturalism, redemption through religion - to a Manichaean battle over one man's soul, the central love match between Norman Duke Robert le Diable and Sicilian Princess Isabelle becomes the plaything for an overarching and curiously Freudian struggle. The characters who act as the evening's puppet-masters are Robert's sister, Alice, representing virtue and his father, Bertram, vice. Though Pelly tightens things up by Act Two, one can't help but feel a trick has been missed in this faithful if stylised realisation, which mines the pen-and-ink work of the 19th century for some picture-book scenery. A Christof Loy might possibly have delved a bit deeper into the psychological implications of the plot, which suggest interior possibilities for all the various exterior high drama. To be fair, Pelly does attempt a conceptualisation, though a little half-heartedly and patronisingly. Primary coloured toy horses, joining toy knights, toy courtiers and pop-up book backdrop, encourages us to see (and perhaps dismiss) the work as child's play. And what of the music? Music that simultaneously provoked Chopin to hail Meyerbeer as one of the greats - ""It is a masterpiece… Meyerbeer has made himself immortal"" - and that also consigned the composer to a century of oblivion. (This is the first British staging since the 19th century.) Both responses to the score are understandable. It's not difficult to see why it became an overnight success. Yet it's also not impossible to recognise why it also disappeared. The melodic writing is frequently very beautiful. And when you think of the variety of form and orchestral colour in the score (and considering the opera appeared amid the hackneyed repetitions and knowing artifice of the operas of Rossini and Donizetti), it's not hard to see why people so hungered after this more spontaneous and intensely felt new drama. There are many musical moments I'd return to - as so many composers did in the century after in dozens of popular arrangements - the dead nun's ballet (choreographed by Lionel Hoche with the just the right amount of orgiastic impropriety), Alice's third act Romance (innocently done by a dangly-legged Marina Poplavskaya) and Isabelle's harp-punctuated Cavatina (Patrizia Ciofi proving a more than able stand in for Diana Damrau). And one could also delight in the frequent exquisite eddies of wind and brass writing that wafted up from the Royal Opera House Orchestra under the baton of Daniel Oren. Yet all this musical variety can - and does - also become a curse. Meyerbeer's commercially driven keenness to move on to the next sparkly idea means he leaves behind a trail of unfinished sentences, something Wagner found very profitable to rectify.Still, more often than not, the music, singing and staging came together last night. Bryan Hymel (Robert) was in admirable control of his tricky, high-lying part, despite having to strain a little. And though he never quite got under the skin of his character Robert - whose schizophrenic toing and froing was never very believable - he never entirely lost us. The panto villain Bertram is an easier role to take advantage of and John Relyea did so to the full. Poplavskaya (pictured right) was a curiously stern angel figure yet, with Relyea, she made the third act and the final scene of the fifth fizz. Both times they were flanked by Chantal Thomas's attractive giant pen-and-ink cut-outs onto which was projected some nifty animation (Claudio Cavallari) - the mountain caves that Bertram stalks transformed into Bosch-like infernos. And then there were the winsome, child-like contributions from Ciofi, pining after her vacillating man from the tops of cardboard cut-out castles. Perhaps Pelly was right to go down the fairytale route after all. The libretto isn't meaty enough to sustain a full psychological make-over. And as we retreat into comfortable Christmas archetypes, primary colour dramatics is perhaps what we want. The Royal Opera may have themselves a surprise winter hit. Robert le Doable? Yes. And it very much deserved to be done.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/robert-le-diable-royal-opera,4
570,"The Merry Widow, Philharmonia Orchestra, Wilson, Royal Festival Hall",The Merry Widow,Philharmonia Orchestra,2012-12-03,Edward Seckerson,"Lehár’s Merry Widow has been been spreading enchantment across the globe for well over a century. She’s the vintage champagne of operettas, and the prospect of John Wilson popping her cork was more than a little enticing. Wilson, one feels, instinctively knows how this music goes and indeed did so before even the composer put the notes on the page. He was surely born into the wrong century. So why do I feel a ""but"" coming on? Why did this particular magnum of bubbly not go to my head?Lehár’s masterpiece was a huge advance in this repertoire with a textural and harmonic sophistication previously unheard in the genre, and as Wilson pitched into the opening pages with an explosive zest that suggested he had shaken the bottle before popping the cork, we knew we were in good hands. Pacing and phrasing were spot on as waltz succeeded waltz and galop swept aside gavotte.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/merry-widow-philharmonia-orchestra-wilson-royal-festival-hall,3
571,"Carmen, English National Opera",Carmen,English National Opera,2012-11-22,Kimon Daltas,"We had already been reassured in interviews that Calixto Bieito’s production of Carmen would not be shocking, although perhaps this was more a warning to those of us hoping that it might be. Bieito’s radical reputation is well earned, although approaching 50 he is by no means an enfant and clearly not so terrible anymore either.The first scene opens with a soldier wearing nothing but Y-fronts and boots, holding a rifle and running round the stage, presumably as a punishment handed out by Corporal Moralès or Lieutenant Zuniga. In fact, there are bits and bobs of undressing at various stages of the production, though nothing one could call gratuitous – apart from the fully nude male dancer during the Act III prelude, and even he is dimly lit and shrouded in a modesty mist.There is a surprise in store, though. The cigarette factory bell rings and the soldiers, with much jostling and thrusting of loins, prepare to ogle the women workers. Out comes Carmen, jet-black hair and a sultry pout; ""phwoar"" say the soldiers, or words to that effect, as she languidly strolls past them and lights a cigarette downstage. Except, what’s this? Why are they asking where Carmencita is, when she is right there? Turns out that isn’t her after all, it is just an actress apparently cast to look exactly like you’d expect Carmen to look, so that when Ruxanda Donose appears – blonde, distinctly un-Spanish – our expectations are confounded.It must have been intentionally playful, except the result is that Donose (pictured above right with Adam Diegel’s José) is undermined before she even begins the evening’s hard slog of trying to convince the audience that she is the raunchy, animalistic, hedonistic and fickle heroine who would ultimately become the victim of her own irresistible charms. It doesn’t work – she is just too nice, too awkward. Her costume for most of it hampers her efforts further: it must be hard to be wild when you’re wearing high heels and a pencil skirt.In an opera with, at best, dubious attitudes to women (the clingy, homely Micaela versus the femme fatale Carmen), the failure here is not in trying to avoid the stereotypes, but rather in trying hard to fulfil them and falling short. It does not help that the part seems to sit rather low in Donose’s voice, so she is never the most sparkling, vital thing on stage: if Carmen isn’t that, then what is she? It is important to add that Donose has a beautiful voice, warm and rounded, and well worth checking out. But things did not gel for her last night.Adam Diegel’s José also started rather underpowered, his bright, forward tenor feeling a little strangulated, but he loosened up in time to give an admirable account of his big second act aria, and kept it up to the bitter end. It is the bit parts that steal show, though, with Rhian Lois and Madeleine Shaw as Frasquita and Mercédès being particular highlights. They are both natural actors, and raise a fair few laughs along the way. Duncan Rock as Moralès is also impressive, not least thanks to his Action Man physique, while a genuinely intimidating Graeme Danby is the lewd and gruff Zuniga. Elizabeth Llewellyn’s Micaëla, though a dreadful drip of a role, gets probably the warmest applause, and well-deserved too.The chorus scenes are a joy, the shabbily gaudy costumes quite appropriately bringing to mind Emir Kusturica films, while presenting the gypsies as economic migrants, or even perhaps illegal immigrants, gives things an interesting spin. And though any admiration for staging restraint, compared to the pointless extravagance of Francesca Zambello’s effort at Covent Garden, is somewhat revised after the appearance of five(!) battered Mercedes for Act III, visually it is a both coherent and satisfying production, and there is no reason that it shouldn’t become a firm part of ENO’s stable for years to come.A rather peculiar moment deserves mention, though. Merrily dressing up a Bambi-limbed child in pink tights and lipstick and dragging her off to join the women in ""distracting the customs officers"" is a directorial interpolation as uncomfortable to watch as it is unnecessary to the plot.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/carmen-english-national-opera,3
572,"L'elisir d'amore, Royal Opera",L'elisir d'amore,Royal Opera,2012-11-14,alexandra Coghlan,"You can tell a lot about a performance of L’elisir d’amore from the two pizzicato string chords that so neatly take the sheen off the military pomp of the opening phrase. Played well, these subversive little asides can throb with all the wit and cheeky self-mockery that elevates this opera above the hundreds of Donizetti also-rans. Played earnestly, as they were last night however, they heralded a rather limp performance – laboriously correct without ever finding (let alone seizing) that anarchic glee that riots through the score.Laurent Pelly’s production returns to the Royal Opera House for its second revival, and while its faded Italian charm is no match for the brasher comedy of ENO’s American Dream, it’s an attractive treatment that reworks Donizetti’s love-farce into a dusty contemporary pastoral. Nemorino rattles up in a tractor, the lovers romp on a pyramid of hay bales, and travelling salesman Dulcamara is greeted by the barks of the local animal-life. Efficient rather than inspired though, only the sudden appearance of stars for “Una furtiva lagrima” generates a really memorable tableau.The real excitement of this revival (directed by Daniel Dooner) is Roberto Alagna’s Nemorino (pictured right). Much has been made of this 20th anniversary of Alagna’s first appearance in the role (back in 1992 at the Vienna State Opera), reminding us a little too keenly perhaps that Alagna’s greatest rival in the role is himself at 30. Nudging 50 now, the tenor still has that certain “it” that is the combination of brute charisma and showmanship, but his beautifully rounded tone is rather harder-won these days. When his muscle memory helps him out (as it did in “Una furtive lagrima”) he still finds resonant spaces towards the upper end of the voice, seemingly ringing rather than singing the phrases. But when he pushes too hard things get hoarse and wayward, and his days of reliable money-notes are surely numbered.Alagna has a tendency to lean back into the arias which doesn’t help, and in cahoots with Bruno Campanella’s pit his “Quanto è bella, quanto è cara” bogged Donizetti’s airy emotion down in a tempo with Wagnerian ambitions. Although things gathered pace in Act II, Campanella’s direction never risked urgency or abandon, and tempo transitions caused no amount of anxiety both onstage among the singers and out in the auditorium. Hopefully this will settle during the run, but just as some unaccompanied works just won’t stick in a particular key, so perhaps Donizetti’s opera will never feel fully organic at these speeds.Last seen bibulous and splendid as Sir John in Robert Carsen’s Falstaff for the Royal Opera, Ambrogio Maestri (pictured left) is once again on the make as the quack Dr Dulcamara. With his impeccably enunciated patter, poised comedy (that toothy whistle in “Io son ricco, e tu sei bella” is perfection) and generous projection, he fills out Pelly’s bright red suit with panache and then some. His is the only voice that doesn’t feel strained or stretched by the Royal Opera House, and its only thanks to some generosity on his part that Alagna and Aleksandra Kurzak’s Adina don’t get crushed vocally underfoot in ensembles.Kurzak (pictured right with Alagna) has a delightful way with her, and while her Adina isn’t perhaps the sensual sophisticate of some productions, her provincial affectations bring an unusual vulnerability to the heroine. Vocally Kurzak isn’t a natural Adina, her voice is bulkier and requires rather more heavy lifting than many around this repertoire. Her coloratura is neat and her mid-range has a characterful warmth, but she doesn’t have the showstopper top notes or – as yet – the power to deliver the role in such a space. Fabio Capitanucci’s Belcore offers a quiet foil to Alagna’s physical clowning, but risks being so dwarfed dramatically that we never really fear for Nemorino’s success, lessening our investment in the tangled intrigue as it plays out.The combination of Alagna’s name and Donizetti’s perennially popular opera will ensure that the Royal Opera House have a success with this revival (well timed to catch the beginning of festive outing season), and Pelly’s gentle humour and Maestri’s presence will ensure that audiences have a good time once they come. But there’s something about this revival that feels token, uncherished. Currently it plays like a slightly dusty vehicle for a big-name star, rather than the ensemble smash that Donizetti had in mind when he wrote that joyous and irreverent opening.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/lelisir-damore-royal-opera,3
573,"La Bohème, OperaUpClose",La Bohème,OperaUpClose,2012-11-09,Richard Scott,"Clearly rents in 2010 were substantially cheaper than I remember because somehow Rodolfo and Marcello have managed to find a garret in Soho of all places. And it would be easy to continue my review in this vein, poking the odd hole in OperaUpClose’s updating of La Bohème, including mentioning my temptation to shout out, “Pawn your laptop for some Covonia, mate, your girlfriend’s got a right cough on her!” But none of those quibbles were really the point of this production. While we did begin in a lacklustre set of IKEA furniture, with some shy, awkward lad acting from the quartet of impoverished arty boys, by the time we’d rushed to the beginning of Act Two, we'd begun to spy the real genius of this production. Director and librettist Robin Norton-hale has asked herself the perhaps obvious but rarely asked question, why have a fake bar crowd onstage when you can use the audience? So her troop of slightly shy singers steeled themselves for some light audience participation and, in doing so, come to life. Act Two was the thrilling heart of this production. At one point, much to my alarm, I thought someone was trying to sell me DVDs inside the theatre. The feisty Musetta, played by the impressive and seductive Prudence Sanders, flirted and tantrumed her way back into the arms of Tom Bullard’s Marcello. Throughout Act Two, the engaging and brave chorus circled us, running back and forth serving drinks, singing, shouting out jibes and providing crisp little vignettes, proving just how useful and provoking a small chorus can be.  The translated libretto concentrated a bit too much on proving just how modern it isNorton-Hale’s fresh staging of the street sellers and café scenes were some of the best I had ever seen. It made the point that, to have it on stage, would in fact have been less interesting and vivid and also revealed an interesting truth. As the houselights rose and the cast swigged gin free G&T’s and suspiciously orange pints of lager, it became incredibly apparent that the audience was not the usual opera audience.I’m not going to be boring about demographics or generalisations but it was pretty clear from peoples' reactions that most of them had never been to the opera before. This is where OperaUpClose excels; they have produced an opera so accessible and alive that the audience didn’t need surtitles or even a synopsis to know what was going on. This really is opera for anyone.Norton-Hale’s frank translation of Illica and Giacosa’s libretto lacked poetry but it certainly did not lack dramatic pacing as it steamed ahead, never relying on a static line. It did, however, concentrate a bit too much on proving just how modern it is by constantly mentioning things like tequila and Strictly (Come Dancing). Norton-Hale doesn’t seem to realise her real strength is in untangling the complex vein of jealousy and affection that runs through the opera. To that end the libretto in Act Three shone. I’m sure that almost everyone in the audience could recognise Mimi’s emotional state as she sang, ""At night when I pretend that I am sleeping, he lies beside me fuming, inventing ways I’ve hurt him"".  By the Fourth Act, the quartet of arty boys have lost their shyness and begun to really act together, providing the audience with hilarious vignettes, including bread throwing and mildly homoerotic ballroom dancing. This ensemble doesn’t diminish, it only strengthens with the introduction of Mimi, sung by the evocative Susan Jiwey. Mimi’s death scene was incredibly moving. It felt at times as if we were watching a farewell performance from a great diva as she died in the arms of Philip Lee’s sensitive Rodolofo. Jiwey never sacrificed her impressive vocal colour or extraordinary range for coughs or acting and pulled off the rare trick of dying on stage with honesty.Rodolfo’s response to this is shocking. I imagine there was a lot of surreptitious eye-daubing as Philip Lee shouted in impassioned grief at his band of helpless bohemians. Philip Lee’s acting was great - subtle throughout and then show stopping towards the end, highlighting the fact that acting is really the key to OperaUpClose’s Bohème. With a simple set and a single piano accompaniment the singers could seem exposed but each in turn rose to the challenge and filled the Charing Cross Theatre with charm, wit and, quite frankly, love.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-boh%C3%A8me-operaupclose,4
574,"The Pilgrim's Progress, English National Opera",The Pilgrim's Progress,English National Opera,2012-11-06,alexandra Coghlan,"John Bunyan’s Christian, hero of The Pilgrim’s Progress, may have been putting his feet up in the Celestial City for the better part of 350 years, but for Ralph Vaughan Williams’s Pilgrim it has been a rather different story. Languishing in the Slough of Despond after an unsuccessful first run at the Royal Opera in the 1950s, the composer’s lavish “Morality” The Pilgrim’s Progress, with its patchwork biblical libretto, vast forces and uniquely blended combination of opera and oratorio, has never since established a secure place in the repertoire.A new production at English National Opera – the company’s first, and indeed the first fully-staged production since the work’s 1951 premiere – provides an opportunity to reassess a piece whose score has long been a quiet favourite among musicians, but whose dramatic viability has never yet been successfully proved.At the head of this rehabilitating mission is director Yoshi Oida. A long-time collaborator of Peter Brook’s, Oida combines a ritualised Japanese quality of gesture with a western frame of reference, and has described his work as “a theatre of service”, likening it to “a bus transporting the audience to a realm of their own imagination which they would not reach otherwise"". It’s a philosophy that chimes with Bunyan’s own dream vision tale, written to carry its readers through the challenging journey of Christian living, and one that also finds resonance in Vaughan Williams’ contemplative score – written to evoke and suggest rather than to enact.Oida frames The Pilgrim’s dream in a prison. Enclosed in a metal cage, an endlessly flexible sequence of walkways, doors and structures create a shifting stage space to accommodate the changing landscape of the journey. All changes happen in plain sight, as everyday prison objects and locations becomes repurposed in the story (most fantastically in an oversized scrap-puppet Apollyon)  with the prisoners themselves taking the roles of Pilgrim’s fellow travellers.Described by a contemporary as ""summarizing in three hours virtually the whole creative output of a great composer"", Vaughan Williams’ score is a collage that avoids self-pastiching smugness by its sheer radiance. Here we find the lofty melody-writing of the Five Mystical Songs, the string sheen of the Fantasia on a Theme of Thomas Tallis, blazing brass fanfares of A Sea Symphony and the folk-simplicity of the a capella choral motets co-existing in a generous muddle of spiritual contemplation.Martyn Brabbins directs the ENO orchestra in a superb performance, keeping the textural surge and swell poised rather than succumbing to the too-easy abandon Vaughan Williams’ music invites. But the orchestra are if anything outdone by the chorus – delighting in some of the finest ensemble-writing they’ll get to sing all season, their blend and painfully-precise tuning transforming the Coliseum into a vast, resonating bell.Roland Wood leads a strikingly young cast as The Pilgrim. A secure but unspectacular start initially disarms, but he warms to a lyrical pitch in the post-interval aria, revealing his dramatic understatement as a long and carefully-calibrated game. Among the visual chaos of the supporting characters, whose allegories riot colourfully all over the stage (the cross-dressing, phallus-wielding Vanity Fair sequence their climax), Wood is a quiet constant, finding support from Eleonor Dennis, Aoife O’Sullivan and Kitty Whately in their various celestial guises. Dennis in particular makes a memorable ENO debut. Showcased over the past few years in Royal College of Music productions, here the powerful young soprano comes of age, showing just how far she has outgrown the chamber space of the Britten Theatre. Surely we will be seeing much more of her in future.Benedict Nelson’s warm legato was made to sing this music, and despite fighting what sounded like some vocal tiredness on opening night, his was the most memorable of the many cameos, though yielding to Timothy Robinson and Ann Murray’s Mr and Mrs By-Ends for comedic precision.The prison-play may be an old operatic conceit, but feels unusually fresh here thanks to the evocative simplicity of Tom Schenk’s designs. Yet conceptually there are some questions. Some rather intrusive video footage in the later scenes makes clear that this is no civilian prison, but rather a prisoner-of-war camp. Black and white images of trench-warfare and combat do their allusive bit to complicate a context that was working beautifully beforehand, seemingly determined to stress The Pilgrim’s innocence.The result is that we lose some of the very necessary friction between Bunyan’s unquestioning (and frankly rather heavy-handed) statement of faith and a more pitted contemporary approach. We lose some of the shivery adrenaline-hit of a coup-de-theatre that sees the Delectable Mountains revealed as an electric chair, shrouded in a sheet of allegorical euphemism, but when Roland Wood’s Pilgrim (pictured right with Dennis as Madam Wanton) asks “Whose Delectable Mountains are these?” the irony is still heavy and horrible.In offering us a closing execution whose horrors dissolve into a euphemising flash of lights and a heavenly chorus, Oida seems to betray his own reading of the work. Vaughan Williams’ morality may be closely aligned to Bunyan’s own, but the inherent simplicity of his drama leaves space for doubts and tensions to colour Pilgrim’s redemption. Performed by the mighty ENO chorus and orchestra, the score offers all the affirmation we could need, and the director’s role is surely to cut against this certitude, to take the edge off the complacency of a straight morality play.Yet with such performing forces, such expansive visuals, and so keen an eye for symbolism, Oida’s production may just be the operatic (Shawshank) redemption this work has been waiting for. Immersive and unconventionally dramatic, this is ENO back at their best.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/pilgrims-progress-english-national-opera,
575,"The Yellow Sofa, Linbury Studio Theatre",The Yellow Sofa,Linbury Studio Theatre,2012-11-06,Richard Scott,"At the heart of Julian Philips’ chamber opera The Yellow Sofa stands, perhaps unsurprisingly, a beautiful antique yellow chaise longue that bears witness to all the adultery, money grabbing and revenge that a 1880s Lisbon household has to offer; but Philips’ sofa is far from mute, she is portrayed here by the exceptional Lauren Easton who sings an extraordinary mix of opera and fado as she narrates, in a sultry yet haughty fashion, all the steamy goings on. To my mind Easton achieves something very rare in opera, a believable fusion of singing styles that not only casts the audience mind outside the window to the plaintive street songs of Lisbon but she also ends the show in a breathtaking moment of fado-esque coloratura.The Yellow Sofa is a work of fusion as both librettist Edward Kemp and composer Julian Philips have worked hard to produce an opera that is truly tragicomic. Godofredo Alves, whose young wife is discovered canoodling with his business partner on the very yellow sofa that he bought for her, seems to almost be in a separate opera of dark despair as he contemplates revenge and even murder while being mocked and bullied by a host of friends and servants who constantly deride him with chromatically vivid chorus lines. Here Michael Wallace proves himself to be an adept and passionate actor as he deals with the fallout from his wife’s affair, and despite the hilarity going on around him is able to bring real pathos to the role. There are times when the whole ensemble cast seem to be involved in some kind of farce where belly laughs and erotic hip swaying dances take centre stage and this does become slightly grating but isn't that the point, how everyone else’s opinions, reactions and gossiping must seem incredibly annoying when you are in real emotional pain like Godofredo. Philips’ score is at its most haunting and effective when he is writing for the piano, played here by the excellent Matthew Fletcher, accompanied by eerie string harmonics and a single metronome to suggest the hours spent wasted in this well-to-do town house in Lisbon. Philips also writes incredibly well for the guitar and the Portuguese fado guitar, bringing a real richness to the score and a refreshing change from the somewhat heavy string section. Philips also knows how to deal well with silence; there are several intense moments when the rumpus of the ensemble cast and orchestra are balanced with a sudden dense silence that again takes us into the dusty and still interior of the grand Lisbon town house that is missing its mistress.The cast never leave the stage, they mostly sit on the sidelines watching and sometimes interjecting as the drama unfolds in Kitty Callister’s brilliantly deconstructed town house, that is made up of little more than a large rug, several potted plants and of course the yellow sofa; and director Frederic Wake-Walker is at his best when dealing with the ensemble cast - there is a memorable moment when together they humorously portray the ornate door that separates Godofredo from his adulterous wife.     Despite overtures towards forgiveness, there is very little closure for the audience at the end of the opera; as Godofredo and his wife reunite we are left surprised and even curious as to how much could been forgotten or forgiven, since in this short chamber opera all the heartbreak and regret seems so vivid and recent. But that’s where The Yellow Sofa excels; it's a bittersweet piece that is hard to pin down, where comic turns by the likes of the wonderful Sioned Gwen Davies, who portrays the Alves’ disgruntled maid, are balanced by such exquisite numbers of heartache and anguish like the near final duet that takes place outside the Lisbon Opera House. Glyndebourne have a unique opera on their hands here, one of fado and silence, and of light-hearted sadness, and they seem to know exactly what to do with it. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/yellow-sofa-linbury-studio-theatre,4
576,theartsdesk in Wexford: L'Arlesiana/Le Roi Malgré Lui at Wexford Festival Opera,theartsdesk in Wexford: L'Arlesiana/Le Roi Malgré Lui at Wexford Festival Opera,,2012-11-05,alexandra Coghlan,"“Last night’s tenor was superb, wasn’t he? Such Italianate passion at the top of his range…” In the pub, the streets and – in this case – over the cereal and croissants of a hotel breakfast, there’s only one topic of conversation in Wexford for 10 days every autumn: opera. During festival time this tiny Irish town on the river Slaney undergoes something of a sea-change. Doctors, plumbers and shop-assistants all transform themselves into the festival staff, ushering audiences, erecting staging and assisting artists.It all makes for an atmosphere of excitement, further fuelled by the festival’s determinedly unusual programming – forgotten operas that often haven’t seen a musicologist, let alone an audience, for several centuries. This year’s lineup is no exception, setting Cilea’s compact domestic tragedy L’Arlesiana against the finessed French comedy of Chabrier’s Le roi malgré lui.On paper it’s the Cilea that whets the appetite; French operatic farces are 10 a penny, while a shy little Italian melodrama with progressive psychological overtones, from the composer of Adriana Lecouvreur, seems an altogether rarer and more enticing prospect. In performance however it proves a fair fight between Cilea’s rich score and Thaddeus Strassberger’s riotous production for Le roi malgré lui.Originally performed in Milan in 1897, Franceso Cilea’s L’Arlesiana is based on the same Alphonse Daudet play that would inspire Bizet’s L'Arlésienne Suite, originally written as incidental music. But in contrast to Bizet’s bright, folk-inspired dances Cilea’s music delves rather deeper into the psychology of its bizarre tale. A young man, Federico, falls in love with a girl from distant Arles and plans to marry her. But when another man appears with proof of her inconstancy, Federico goes mad with grief and eventually kills himself.While the tragedy is standard enough, what is striking is the absence of the opera’s namesake. This catalyst for death, jealousy, maternal grief and even madness has no part in the action, not a single line to sing, either in defence or seduction. In Rosetta Cucchi’s production however she becomes a visual idée fixe, a single silent figure who becomes multiplied into a crowd of sinister doppelgangers as the action reaches its climax in an insane asylum.The opera’s libretto is littered with the language of health and sanity, and Cucchi seizes upon this as an opportunity to offer a darker take on the “was it all just a dream?” scenario. If the girl from Arles is in fact a phantom, a projection of a disturbed mind, then what does that tell us about male sexuality, desire and his relation to the female? Here, unfortunately, the answer feels a little forced, the tragic dice a little too heavily loaded. I’m not sure either that for most people’s first encounter with the opera such a revisionist take is helpful, nor that the reversing of a rare operatic instance of a woman as architect rather than victim of tragedy is entirely welcome.Nevertheless, if the onstage action offers some issues then there is ample consolation from David Angus’s pit. Perhaps a little over-wrought at times, his charged reading (and the excellent playing of the Wexford Festival Orchestra, whose string section in particular is a joy) is only appropriate for such a production. This lyrical, expansive score can take any amount of emoting, and it says a lot that on leaving the theatre I heard someone whistling Tosca. Puccini is just over the fence from Cilea’s finer moments, and the structural coherence of music that has its climax in sight even as we start is as effective as it is impressive.Too many intervals did little to emphasise this continuity, but the cast did a fine job of guiding us back each time into their torrid dramas. Dmitry Golovnin’s Federico (pictured left) releases into a superb howl of an aria as his doom becomes evident, and after some dodgy intonation at the start, Mariangela Sicilia’s lovelorn Vivetta proves herself an attractive, if dramatically matter-of-fact, path of reason. I didn’t warm to Annuziata Vestri’s vocal histrionics as Rosa Mamai, but Christopher Robertson’s Baldassarre anchored things nicely for the younger cast.What a contrast greeted us the next night, however, in Strassberger’s irrepressible vision of Le roi malgré lui. Originally seen at the SummerScape festival in New York’s Bard College earlier this year, the production takes an already complicated romp of intrigue and identity and does it all backwards and in high heels. There’s little here to carry a severe, modernist reading, with a score whose moments of brilliance (a stunningly bluesy lament for gypsy girl Minka, a glowing, throbbing duet between her and the Duchess Alexina) are heavily outweighed by G&S-style pastiche and silliness. So Strassberger’s answer is to go with the flow and outdo the excess.The result is endearingly smart and gloriously vulgar for the first hour and a half, and then becomes exhausting. Unlike the stiffly controlled Cucchi, there is no end to Strassberger’s creative invention. But when silent sub-plots are playing out in every corner, and three scenes are always playing at any one moment (it really does feel like split-screen cinema) the relentless stimulus becomes too much.It all starts so well, as 18th Century ladies and gentleman are freed from a storage facility packing-case, their card party jostling with a contemporary rival gathering across the stage. The world of Poland and Paris collide in a lost-in-translation plot that sees Henri de Valois named king of Poland. Banished from his homeland, he finds himself the chief schemer in a plot to overthrow himself (I told you it was G&S) and romping with a variety of local women, only to find his erstwhile paramour Alexina (originally seduced in Venice, and now accompanied everywhere by a gondola) suddenly reappearing together with her husband le Duc de Fritelli (Frédéric Goncalves, pictured above). Got that?Sunbeds, gondolas, Strictly Come Dancing and a troop of overgrown toy soldiers all play their parts in this fantasy-farce, with Strassberger’s inspired rewrite of the ball as a Mitteleuropean TV spectacular working particularly well. There’s plenty of serious singing to balance the silliness however, with the cast led by Mercedes Arcuri as the beguiling slave Minka. Delivering her showstopper arias with complete control, gorgeously floated upper register and clean coloratura, she balanced the rather bland vocals of Liam Bonner as Henri – seemingly cast for his body rather than his baritone. Frédéric Goncalves spluttered and gurned in the character role of Fritelli, expostulating with aplomb in at least three languages in the spoken sections.The Wexford Festival Opera Chorus were out in full force here as soldier, courtiers, French maids and folk-dancers, and embraced Strassberger’s characterisation with gusto. Some excellent singing (particularly from the female chorus) was matched by energetic acting, and if the overall effect was a little much, then it’s nothing that some judicious cuts to a score that could easily lose 45 minutes and not miss them wouldn’t fix.A trip to Wexford is always uncertain, and that in the best possible way. The experience of three nights of new operas, surrounded by a crowd experiencing them all for the first time too, is a high you don’t get often in the metropolitan centres, with their thousands of seats to fill and their endless Toscas and Turandots. This quirky little festival has carved out its niche, and by sheer energy and commitment (not to mention the always-glossy productions) has convinced the world to come and squash into it once a year. It’s a stimulating start to the autumn opera season, but above all it’s fun – something to take the edge off all those Ring Cycles, to send you back smiling and refreshed to Mozart, Verdi and Puccini.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/theartsdesk-wexford-larlesianale-roi-malgr%C3%A9-lui-wexford-festival-opera,
577,"Don Giovanni, English National Opera",Don Giovanni,English National Opera,2012-10-18,alexandra Coghlan,"“Don Giovanni – Coming Soon” winked and nudged the publicity posters for English National Opera’s latest production. And just in case the entendre wasn’t clear they added a picture of a condom. Playful, provocative and just a little bit sordid, it captured the spirit of Mozart’s damaged seducer with singular accuracy. Too bad the revival of Rufus Norris’s 2012 production, though much changed since we last saw it, is still about as enticing as a second-hand sex toy.Jeremy Sams has written a brilliant contemporary libretto – less a translation and more a free reworking of Da Ponte’s text. The bon mots gleam like the teeth-twinkle in a vintage advertisement, a shard of light in an otherwise grim and grubby production. Leporello’s 21st-century catalogue aria (complete with spreadsheets and graphs) gets a big laugh, as does the neat updating of Don Giovanni’s conquests – “Dark girls and fair girls, Swedish au-pair girls” – with extra points for later rhyming “Jacuzzi” and “floozy”. The libretto, which deserves so much better than Norris’s confused treatment, also gave us a new and rather striking moment of psychological realism in the Don’s serenade Deh vieni alla sua finestra. Rather than seduce yet another faceless woman he instead yearns for a “lost beloved” – a pure and uncorrupted love he can no longer regain. Coupled with Iain Paterson’s inward delivery and fragility, it was a rare moment of truth among chaos.Things have improved in the two years since the premiere. Norris has stripped away a lot of heavy symbolism and crowd faff. Gone are the masked revellers who previously dashed and shrieked their way around in some nightmarish carnival, and also banished is the electric installation and its accompanying metaphor: that Don Giovanni, he’s so charged with sexual electricity it might just be the death of him. Unfortunately however nothing has really been put forward to fill the absence, so now where once things were baffling and cluttered, they are now vacant and dramatically flaccid.It doesn’t help that Paterson’s Don Giovanni (pictured below with Matthew Best as the Commendatore) is still a beautifully-sung cipher. Sporting a slightly better wardrobe this time around he at least stands a chance of playing a plausible seducer, but his casual naturalism just gets drowned out by Ian MacNeil’s riotously ugly sets and Norris’s background activity. Strong work comes from Darren Jeffery, who brings a comedic warmth to Leporello that predecessor Brindley Sherratt lacked. The interplay of the recitative between Jeffery and Paterson however lacks the pace it achieved last time round, although speeds generally are kept up by Edward Gardner in the pit.Sarah Tynan and John Molloy reprise their roles as Zerlina and Masetto with as much charm and gusto as ever. Tynan in particular is pitch-perfect in her canny but delicately vulgar bride-to-be (who could resist her Batti, batti?), with Molloy gamely stepping up as her posturing fiancé. There’s strong work also from Sarah Redgwick as Donna Elvira, whose tightly-wound ardour plays out with technical efficiency.Only Katherine Broderick’s Donna Anna disappoints, dramatically awkward and uncommitted, while her magnificent dramatic soprano (last time powerful but a little out of control) now feels a little too gripped and held-back. Her scenes with Ben Johnson’s Ottavio (elegantly sung, as ever) verge on the comic at times, with neither physically comfortable in their interactions.MacNeil’s sets are still cumbersome and bleak, framing the action in an indeterminate period of brutalist kitsch, somehow combining a back-alley rubbish dump for the Commedatore’s monument and a mint-green fantasy boudoir in the same production. At least the final descent to Hell has been improved (less electricity), though a few groans and a messed-up picnic could still do with a bit of help to bring things to the climax Mozart’s music intended.You can make Don Giovanni a kitschy comedy or a gothic revenge tragedy and still have a great show, but there’s no excuse for it to be bafflingly, profoundly unsexy. Lose the sex and you lose the psychology along with it – that electric pulse of desire that Norris’s original production was surely striving to suggest. ENO has done right by their experiment and given it a second chance, but now it’s time to move on from this operatic coitus interruptus and find a new Don Giovanni with follow-through.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/don-giovanni-english-national-opera-0,2
578,"Faust, Opera North",Faust,Opera North,2012-10-15,graham Rickson,"You leave Opera North’s new Faust buzzing and bleary-eyed. The production sounds glorious, with terrific singing. It’s also blessed and cursed with a visually astonishing staging which thrills only slightly more than it infuriates. This company’s cheeky Carmen update annoyed many in 2011, and their take on ""the second most popular French opera"" will leave some spectators perplexed.Ran Arthur Braun and Rob Kearley’s updating is broadly contemporary but full of anachronistic details – the chorus could pass for Mad Men extras, though gazing at iPads and occasionally filming proceedings on their smart phones. At the opera’s outset, Peter Auty’s Faust resembles little more than a burnt-out, middle-aged executive – eye-catching, morphing computer graphics hinting at his scientific achievements. His cerebral career hasn’t left him much time for fleshly pleasures; his suicide threats cue the entrance of James Creswell’s scene-stealing Méphistophélès (pictured below), a sharply dressed, ponytailed charmer who appears to be channelling Robert de Niro’s Louis Cyphre from the film Angel Heart.When Méphistophélès takes possession of Faust’s soul, he physically removes the heart – a deliciously repellent moment, made more repulsive by his coyly placing the bloody object into a small perspex box. Faust’s rejuvenation is neatly achieved through cosmetic surgery – though, apart from removing his glasses, he seems remarkably unchanged. And there’s this production’s biggest problem – Auty thereafter remains an inoffensive chap in a grey suit, still charisma-deficient and rarely seeming heroic. Which is such a shame, as Auty’s voice is one of this production’s glories, his lyrical high register never showing signs of strain.Video artist Lillevan’s projections soon establish themselves as the production’s dominant element, enabling Ran Arthur Braun’s austere set to be transformed in seconds. White screens slide from left to right - a wonderful, practical device, but on more than one occasion I was worried that Auty’s Faust would be bloodily bisected after failing to dodge one. White cubes, reminiscent of a Tate installation, fulfil ingenious multiple roles, among them jewel boxes, giant dice and podiums. Lillevan’s visual effects are frequently stunning – the casino imagery in Act 2 after Méphistophélès sings of the value of money is eye-popping, as is the stark, white abortion clinic at the opening of Act 4. There’s a brilliant, tiny moment in the Jewel Song where Juanita Lascarro’s Marguerite gazes at herself, briefly spotlit by the flash of paparazzi cameras. Lascarro is physically and vocally perfect for the role. You can imagine exactly why a depressive 50-something male would go off the rails in pursuit.Gounod’s chorus of soldiers and villagers are depicted as supporters of Marcin Bronikowski’s Valentin (pictured left), who resembles a Republican US presidential candidate. This has some darkly comic potential, notably the crowd defending themselves against Méphistophélès using bibles and beer bottles held in the shape of the cross, although seeing the same chorus members holding anti-abortion placards at the start of Act 4 feels forced and uncomfortable. As with so many Opera North productions, the chorus is consistently magnificent, particularly in the brief unaccompanied prayer heard soon after Valentin’s death. Stuart Stratford’s conducting makes Gounod’s music sound rich, profound and defiantly unfrothy. There are no weak links in the supporting roles – Robert Anthony Gardiner and Sarah Pring are excellent as Siébel and Marthe. Marvel at the visual effects and lighting, Wince at the final image, and breathe a sigh of relief as the house lights come on.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/faust-opera-north,4
579,"The Lighthouse, English Touring Opera",The Lighthouse,English Touring Opera,2012-10-12,Kimon Daltas,"Confinement is a thread running through English Touring Opera’s autumn season. In Albert Herring it is in the priggish village; in The Emperor of Atlantis it is in the circumstances of its creation within the Terezín concentration camp; in The Lighthouse, it is one room with curved walls and the interminable wait for the relief ship.This 1979 chamber opera by Peter Maxwell Davies, who also wrote the libretto, is based on real events: in 1900 a supply ship stopping at the lighthouse on a tiny Outer Hebridean island found it in good shape but deserted, with no sign of its three keepers. The first half of the opera dramatises a board of inquiry, in which the three officers who found the abandoned lighthouse give evidence on what they found – the details are hazy, but an open verdict is returned. For the second half, the officers are transformed into the lighthouse keepers, and we bear witness to their gradual descent into madness as the foghorn sounds, the mist creeps in and their nightmares edge reality out.A genuinely Poesque denouement (no spoilers ahead) suggests that the composer could have had a side career as a macabre mystery writer.Musically, it may be a little hard to love. By the time of the opera’s composition, eight years of Orkney air had blown the arch-modernism out of Davies’ music, but we are still dealing with a fairly cold and abstract sound world. We see the composer working with a fine paintbrush, creating sparse textures with little sustained forward motion. The diverse instrumentation eschews the comfort of a familiar orchestral sound, throwing up snippets of guitar, crotales, flexatone, jangly out of tune piano. A deafening climax, when it comes, is all the more surprising. It may not be emotional music, but it is certainly atmospheric, and it is easy to see why The Lighthouse maintains a position in the repertory (four separate productions international this year alone).The three men, Adam Tunnicliffe (Sandy), Nicholas Merryweather (Blazes) and Richard Mosley-Evans (Arthur), sing strongly and bring off the acting too. The poisonous chemistry between them – ""All too close in this prison to keep any secrets"" – is what the drama hinges on, and they do extremely well in rubbing each other up the wrong way.Overall it is a very satisfying piece of theatre which this production (designed by Neil Irish and directed by Ted Huffman) gets the absolute best out of. No arbitrary updating here: in this world of oilskin and shadows, everything, from lighting to costumes via the characters’ chain smoking, is geared towards a murky atmosphere, entirely faithful to the piece.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/lighthouse-english-touring-opera,4
580,"The Emperor of Atlantis, English Touring Opera",The Emperor of Atlantis,English Touring Opera,2012-10-06,alexandra Coghlan,"Victor Ullmann’s 1943 opera The Emperor of Atlantis never made it beyond a dress rehearsal during the composer’s tragically curtailed lifetime. Composed in the Terezín concentration camp, this operatic satire is a work of exquisite bravery – a musical credo and shout of defiance that backs humanity in the face of overwhelming odds. It’s also an exuberant magpie score, where the composer’s ear for jazz, cabaret, neo-classical pastiche and dance tunes shows its inventive skill.After disappearing until the 1970s, the work is enjoying something of a revival in London at the moment. A fringe production at Dalston’s Grimeborn festival earlier this year served as prelude to English Touring Opera’s new staging, currently playing at the Royal Opera House’s Linbury Theatre before travelling around the UK.In director James Conway’s conception the opera’s closing chorale – Bach-inspired, but with the insistent secular rhythms and echoes of life still pulsing in the orchestra – finds itself prefigured in a staging of Bach’s cantata Christ lag in Todesbanden (Christ Lay in Death’s Bonds). Integrating this vocal quartet (pictured below) into Ullmann’s narrative, Conway has these grubby, terrified figures, clutching family and luggage, perform the cantata in front of an audience of Death and the Emperor himself. The tale of Christ’s struggle over death is then dissolved and fragmented, reformed into the darker satire of the opera itself.It’s quite a gesture, and one that is made almost unbearably poignant by the re-orchestration of the Bach for Ullmann’s bizarre orchestra – the group of instruments available to him in the camp. Hearing Bach through the unfamiliar tones of a clarinet, unnaturally raw and rough-edged, is as vivid a homage to this brutal episode of history as I’ve heard.Neil Irish’s artifully faded and aged designs place us in a surrealist Second World War fantasy. All is grotesque yet familiar. The knock-kneed young boy of the Bach becomes the war-mongering Drummer (Katie Bray) complete with thigh-bone drumsticks and androgynous uniform, while Death himself is revealed as an elderly soldier (Robert Winslade-Anderson), clutching his scythe to his muddy trench-coat. The staging invites us to view life as the cabaret turns and side-show tricks of a second-rate travelling circus, where Death is the only ringmaster.In this circus we see Death (accompanied by his friend and sidekick Harlequin (Jeff Stewart) decide to go on strike. The Emperor’s “universal war” thus cannot claim its victims, no matter how many times they are strangled or shot. Eventually Death and the Emperor come face to face, and the former promises to return to his duties provided that the Emperor be the first to sample “the new death”.English Touring Opera has always been good at identifying new young talent, and this cast is no exception. The standouts are the two women - Katie Bray’s Drummer and Paula Sides’ Maiden. Bray has a wonderfully punchy and character-driven mezzo that makes light work of this athletic role, comfortably inhabiting the more physical side of her stage persona (where some of her colleagues struggled). Sides has a glassy soprano that really opens up at the top. Her impassioned encounter with the young soldier (Rupert Charlesworth, pictured above left with Sides) where love and death collide makes for a thrilling dramatic centrepiece.The double-act between Death and Harelquin offers most of the evening’s laughs – dark ones, inevitably. The two old cronies break into a vaudeville routine, complete with soft-shoe shuffle and a nifty bit with the scythe, and later slip into in a dream-like waltz. Dance underscores everything here, and tangos, waltzes and sedate foxtrots burst out through the fabric of the drama at unexpected moments. Faithful to the original conception, Conway keeps a lot of this in, even if his male singers are not yet quite comfortable with the movement.Despite moments of tension between stage and pit, both Winslade-Anderson and Steward do well to bring off this bizarre relationship. It’s Richard Mosley-Evans' Emperor (pictured above) sadly who brings tensions to a head however, losing all the climactic lyricism of the final defiant aria in an underpowered gurgle of vocal straining.It’s the sole blot on what will otherwise grow into a pretty flawless production. By the time the opening quartet return to sing Ullmann’s closing chorale, so desperately yearning after the resurrection and redemption Bach offers, this miniature evening of barely one and a quarter hours has offered all the emotion and intensity of a full-length opera. Thank goodness English Touring Opera understood this and didn’t attempt to wed it in some awkward double-bill.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/emperor-atlantis-english-touring-opera,4
581,"Albert Herring, English Touring Opera",Albert Herring,English Touring Opera,2012-10-05,Kimon Daltas,"Albert Herring probably doesn’t make the top five most performed of Britten’s operas, yet is easily the best known work in English Touring Opera’s brave Autumn season – the other two are Viktor Ullmann’s The Emperor of Atlantis and Peter Maxwell Davies’ The Lighthouse.Britten’s ""country comedy"" is light-hearted but it displays similar preoccupations to Peter Grimes and Billy Budd – insularity, groupthink, innocence and a hero who doesn’t fit in. Overall, ETO gave a compelling production with very effective direction from Christopher Rolls. The characterisation in the piece is fairly two-dimensional – we are dealing with types rather than fully-fledged individuals – but Rolls gets the best out of his cast, with plenty of nifty comedic touches, and the Suffolk village’s suffocating smallness is right there.Albert himself (Mark Wilde) is a picture of bumbling nervousness, if perhaps lacking some of the wide-eyed wholesomeness which really clinches the role. Charles Rice as Sid, the rakish butcher, is spot on and a great match for Martha Jones’ Nancy – the chemistry is convincing and the voices well matched. Jennifer Rhys-Davies makes a very imposing Lady Billows, if a little underpowered on the first night. The rest of smaller roles are also well cast and enthusiastically performed: a particular highlight is the effervescent Miss Wordsworth (Anna-Clare Monk) taking choir practice. A lack of surtitles, however, presents a bit of a challenge not always taken up: especially in ensemble numbers some of the comedy dissipates through half-heard lines.They say that when lighting is good one shouldn’t notice it, but in this black box theatre with no proscenium arch, in a single-set production, Guy Hoare deserves special mention for conjuring up a very distinct atmosphere and sense of space for each act. Neil Irish’s neat set of a skeleton of a house cleverly allows action both indoors and out without sightline problems, though perhaps allowed a hint of abstract modernity into this archetypically rustic world.The 14 young musicians in the pit were from Aurora Orchestra, conducted by ETO’s music director Michael Rosewell. There is a great deal of complexity in the music, plus all manner of special effects, not to mention many exposed passages for instruments more used to courage in numbers (a sprightly double bass solo comes to mind). The band was flawless, and Rosewell kept things tight and light, extracting every ounce of wit from a score which may not be Britten’s best, but still has plenty to enjoy.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/albert-herring-english-touring-opera,4
582,"Così fan tutte, Welsh National Opera",Così fan tutte,Welsh National Opera,2012-10-04,stephen Walsh,"For some reason, the Welsh have revived their Così fan tutte, from last year, with positively unseemly haste – if not quite so unseemly as the haste with which their La Bohème, from this spring, was wheeled back on last month barely three months after its first airing. It looks as if the outgoing intendant John Fisher, never notable for lively repertory planning, was either clearing his desk, or had simply scarpered. His successor, David Pountney, has bravely been much in evidence on company first nights this year, but cannot yet be blamed for what he, and we, are hearing and seeing.This Così, directed by Benjamin Davis and designer Max Jones with a vulgarity that I prefer not to describe again (suffice it to say that Barry Island pier on August bank holiday seems to have been the model), was at least reasonably well sung when it was new. The revival is to put it mildly substandard, and in some respects utterly unworthy of a company with the international reputation that WNO has enjoyed, and rightly enjoyed, over many, many years.The problem begins, it must be said, in the pit. Mark Wigglesworth, a conductor whose huge talent needs no praise from me, leads the entire performance as if his main aim is to get it over with as soon as possible. Perhaps one shouldn’t blame him. He is the only person down there who can see what is going on on the stage: the ghastly pantomime crocodiles and fat ladies, the trick buttonholes and false noses. But the performance often actually sounds as if he can’t bear to watch, but prefers to scurry on regardless of the difficulties his galloping tempi pose for his singers. The orchestra cope, of course, brilliantly; the singers less well.Sometimes one feels sorry for them. Poor Fiordiligi (Elizabeth Watts), forced to sing “Come scoglio”, one of the tricky showpieces of the soprano repertoire, framed by a kaleidoscope of stage business, understandably makes little of it musically, though she projects its ill temper effectively enough. Only with “Per pietà” in the second act, where the director leaves her alone, does she blossom into a vocal actress worthy of this astounding music.The other occasional star of the show is the Despina, Joanne Boag, a vocal comedian of huge charm and an agile singer who can even bring off “Una donna a quindici anni” waving a lavatory brush (and showering her supposed employers – though they aren’t that in this production, the many textual references notwithstanding – with its contents). Neal Davies (pictured right) repeats his adequate, pier-entertainer Don Alfonso from last year, though his stage persona (not his fault) reduces the philosopher’s gamble to the illegal passing of a betting slip.The rest is disappointment or worse. The Dorabella, Cora Burggraaf, waves her arms and willowy form around enthusiastically, but is increasingly troubled by the music, ending with an “È amore un ladroncello” devoid of tone and musical focus, supported, though, by lovely woodwind playing. Andrew Tortise sings Ferrando with level fluency but with a chilly, white tone that one half-suspects he might blame on the plastic nose that passes for disguise on the Glamorgan coast. The Guglielmo, Gary Griffiths, also false-nosed, has his moments in the brilliant “Non siate ritrosi” (“bel naso,” indeed), but elsewhere seems to have difficulty sustaining even the role’s hypocritical ardour in tennis shorts and Butlins blazer.I nourish the hope that the rapid revival of this well-managed but tasteless farrago may be a prelude to its swift demise. The banks of empty seats might suggest I'm not alone in this. But too many great works popped in and out under Fisher’s unsteady hand (I recall the Fidelio with undiminished horror).

583,"In a Locked Room/ Ghost Patrol, Linbury Studio Theatre",In a Locked Room/ Ghost Patrol,Linbury Studio Theatre,2012-10-01,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"There's no guaranteed route to success with contemporary opera but, ever since Nixon in China, topicality and realism have become the most favoured and trusted paths to some kind of favourable outcome. Two chamber operas, receiving their English premiere at the Linbury Studio Theatre on the weekend, joined this ever-expanding modern school of verismo. Huw Watkins, who moonlights as one of the finest young pianists of his generation, delivered the first, In the Locked Room. This 50-minute work, scored in a very reserved, very English way, offers us a simple domestic melodrama shot through with some fashionable themes of the day. Ruby Hughes's Ella is trapped in a loveless marriage to banker Paul Curievici's Stephen. Their dream move to the coast puts her into contact with poet Pascoe (Hakan Vramsmo), whom Ella falls for and has an affair with. She is faced with a dilemma. Does she go for the soulful artist or the soulless money bags? It's a question that librettist David Harsent no doubt wants us to ask of our society too.As plotlines go, it's hard to think of an older or more hoary one than this tale of poet vs parvenu. It's also difficult to imagine it being delivered more predictably. Throughout the episodic libretto, ingratiating music and tasteful goings on on set, cliché is stuck to doggedly. The banker it turns out is a bit of a Julian Assange. The poet's troubled - and ends up killing himself. The trapped wife has an interior life and creative yearning that she wants an outlet for. The interior locked room is doubled by a real locked room, the metaphorical broken home echoed by a real house that splits in two etc.Every idea was obvious. Every opinion was received. Every line toed a boring, troglodytic orthodoxy. Banker: bad. Poet: good. Woman: oppressed. In this year where all the running has been made for the argument that art can make you better and wiser, my first thought was that here was art that definitely made you more dumb. My second thought - give me a successful banker over an unsuccessful poet any day - perhaps proved the first.Next to Watkins's forgettable score, MacRae's ballsy offering in Ghost Patrol was a godsend. Muscular, energetic, inventive and smart, the percussive and spasmodic sounds were always there to catch Louise Welsh's libretto when it began to totter. Welsh's story begins convincingly enough, in the middle of a raid on a bar. Barman Alasdair collars burglar Sam before realising they both served in the army together. He gives the destitute former comrade a job and inadvertently also access to his wife. As an affair ensues and trouble returns, Welsh foolishly abandons detail and realism for profundity and message. A nicely told love triangle with plenty of potential goes up in a puff of po-facedness. That the evening is not entirely squandered is down to a fantastically committed performance from James McOran-Campbell as the barman Alasdair (the only three-dimensional character) and MacRae's intelligent word painting and engrossing colours. Conductor Michael Rafferty and the orchestra of Music Theatre Wales deserve much credit for bringing these musical qualities out. The productions meanwhile (Michael McCarthy for In the Locked Room; Matthew Richardson for Ghost Patrol) were unfussy and uninspiring. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/locked-room-ghost-patrol-linbury-studio-theatre,2
584,"Prince Igor, Hamburg State Opera",Prince Igor,Hamburg State Opera,2012-09-28,stephen Walsh,"Samuel Johnson’s description of opera as an exotic and irrational entertainment might well have been written after a performance of Borodin’s Prince Igor, give or take a hundred years or so. Of all great operas – and it is one – this must be one of the most colourful and most confused. Which is no doubt why it is very seldom staged, and why I thought it worthwhile to go to Hamburg to catch up with David Pountney’s new production at the Staatsoper in the city of Brahms, who was born in the same year as Borodin and never even tried to write an opera. Borodin, by contrast, tried for 18 years, before dropping dead, ironically, at a costume ball when he was 53.The story of the composition of Prince Igor would make a good, long-running soap. In his day job, Borodin was professor of chemistry at the St Petersburg Academy of Science; he was a serious and, it seems, important researcher and a conscientious administrator, with an ever-open door, and incidentally a musician wife who charmed everyone but was sickly and psychologically unstable, suffered from tuberculosis, agorophobia and night fears, declined to go to bed before daylight and insisted on her husband doing the same.Not surprisingly, writing music for Borodin was a spasmodic and somewhat disorganized business. Not for him the simple recourse of starting his opera at the beginning and proceeding towards the end at whatever pace he could manage. In fact he never wrote out a proper scenario, but pieced the story together as he went along, sometimes composing whole chunks of music, even whole scenes, without quite knowing where they would come in the opera.When he died in 1887, he left the work in chaos, and it was pieced together – literally with the different bits of manuscript spread out on the floor – by his friend Rimsky-Korsakov and Rimsky’s young pupil Alexander Glazunov. Glazunov himself relates how they had to compose some sections themselves, sometimes on the basis of fragmentary sketches whose exact intention was unknown. And they had to orchestrate almost everything. The well-known overture, for instance, was composed by Glazunov using material from the opera and the store of his own memory of Borodin having played it through once or twice on the piano.The amazing thing about this tale is that the authentic parts of Prince Igor, the substantial parts we know Borodin completed, contain some of the most brilliant and unforgettable music in any opera. The Polovtsian Dances (pictured below) need no advocacy. But they are the icing on the cake: a whole string of magnificent solo numbers, arias for Igor himself and for his wife Yaroslavna, for the Polovtsian Khan Konchak and his daughter (known as Konchakovna), an exquisite duet for Konchakovna and Igor’s son Vladimir, and a superb confrontation between Yaroslavna and her feckless brother, Galitsky, not to mention chorus after chorus that ought to be in every choral society’s repertoire. They not only show that Borodin was a musical genius, but that he had a feeling for theatre second only, perhaps, to Musorgsky among Russian composers.As a dramatic design, though, the medieval epic of Prince Igor was probably beyond him, at least in the circumstances. For one thing, it covers too much ground. The prince sallies forth from the Kievan city of Putivl against the marauding Polovtsi, is badly defeated and captured, while back home poor Yaroslavna and her household are left at the mercy of Galitsky and his gang of debauchees. Igor at first refuses to escape, for some reason deeming it dishonourable; then he does so, leaving behind his son, who is in love with Konchakovna, and the opera ends with the modified rapture of his return to Putivl, but without any resolution of the Galitsky issue or the love dilemma. Pountney has Vladimir cut his own throat with the dagger handed him by Konchak to use against his fellow Russians in the coming Polovtsian attack on Putivl. But though this is no bad idea, Borodin didn’t think of it or write music for it.Unable to resolve the narrative problem, Pountney turns to a concept. For him, the justification for staging Prince Igor today is that it dramatizes a political and cultural issue that remains crucial to modern Russia (and was basic, too, for Borodin’s contemporaries): its position on the margin between Europe and Asia. He accordingly presents us with the antique world of the 12th-century Lay of Igor’s Campaign, in the form of a chorus-line of beautifully painted costume cut-outs, alongside images of modern Russia: Igor commissar-like at his desk, Soviet police, and drunken Russian soldiers who commit brutal rape on a young schoolgirl in a gym-slip.The sun, eclipsed during the Prologue to the horror of the cut-outs, is a third-degree spot-lamp trained, naturally, on the audience. The Polovtsians are part exotics out of Kismet or the Diaghilev ballet, part terrorists with AK-47s who shoot more or less anyone who gets in their way; and his slave-girls are exhausted and demoralized captives for whom the dances are a form of torture ending in death (a consciously anachronistic reference, maybe, to The Rite of Spring).None of this is much help in elucidating the plot, needless to say, but it does throw up some spectacular stage pictures, designed by Robert Innes Hopkins and Marie-Jeanne Lecca. The opening scene, with the cut-outs, is merely quaint, and rather static, at least until Igor mounts an enormous golden horse and rides off into the sunset; but the image of Yaroslavna in her terem (literally a tower, pictured below left) perfectly catches the sense of her helplessness, locked away like the Lady of Shalott; and the shock value of the debauchery scenes and the violent, anti-erotic scenes in the Polovtsian camp, may not be so very far from the way a contemporary audience would have reacted, if given the chance, to the horrible idea of savage orientals beating Russians in the field then lecturing them in a friendly fashion (as Konchak lectures Igor) about the way a gentleman should take his pleasures – not something, it’s true, one would have expected from Osama bin Laden.The Australian Simone Young, the soon-outgoing director of the Hamburg Opera (her replacement from 2015, Kent Nagano, was announced on the day I was there), conducts the so-called Maryinsky version of the opera, as recorded, superbly, by Valery Gergiev. The version rearranges the acts and reintroduces several numbers that Borodin cut out, mostly at the behest of his interfering fellow-members of the Balakirev circle, including a stunning mutiny scene and a fine monologue for Igor in the Polovtsian camp. No question that all this is an improvement on what is, after all, hardly a genuine entity in any case.As for the performance, one should be mainly grateful for the opportunity, and wish to goodness one of our own major companies would revive the work (the last to do so was the Royal Opera 22 years ago). The performance I heard was weakened by an indisposition to Andrzej Dobber, in the title role; he bravely came on, but was clearly in difficulty. On the other hand, the Georgian soprano Veronika Dzhioeva was a ravishing Yaroslavna, superb alike in her first act monologue (the first music Borodin composed for the opera) and her wonderful scene with the ever-sardonic Galitsky (Rafał Siwek, also excellent), the touchstone of Borodin’s ability to humanize and diversify operatic expression.The Polovtsians, Tigran Martirossian (Konchak) and Cristina Damian (Konchakovna) seemed to take a while to get the measure of this big house, but made a fine pair of lovable savages, authentic in cutthroat gentility and sensual passion respectively. Damian’s duet with Dovlet Nurgeldiyev (Vladimir) was a high point, as of course the drama, such as it is, requires. Borodin, too, was enticed by the east, as he understood it, and was probably destroyed, like Vladimir Igorevich, by his inability to reconcile conflicting demands on his emotions and loyalties.Young herself performed more than adequately after a rough start to the overture, and despite some shaky moments of stage ensemble. She drew fine, if somewhat strident singing from the chorus in their many roles (Putivlites, boyars, Soviet ruffians, schoolgirls), and decent work from the pit in music that draws on an orchestral tradition these players are surely unused to. The dancing, in its unconventional way, was very effective in context, though I can’t comment on the technical side. One remarkable discovery was that Young has been not only musical director but effectively intendant as well: Pappano and Tony Hall rolled into one no doubt deceptively frail female. No wonder she is little known elsewhere.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/prince-igor-hamburg-state-opera,
585,"London Philharmonic Orchestra, Jurowski, Royal Festival Hall",London Philharmonic Orchestra,Jurowski,2012-09-27,David Nice,"Dissatisfied housewives who eventually stand by their men joined jewelled hands in a divine evening of operatic decadence. Suppressed Bianca all but steps over the body of her strangled lover to get at the muscles of her killer husband in Zemlinsky’s A Florentine Tragedy, taking its cue from the deep purple imagery of Oscar Wilde’s story. And in Richard Strauss’s Die Frau ohne Schatten (The Woman without a Shadow), the Dyer’s Wife readily gives up her dreams of sacrificing motherhood and taking up with a fantasy toyboy when domestic violence looms. Dodgy premises both, and unlikely subjects for the gorgeous orchestral tapestries both composers lay before them. Vladimir Jurowski kept the colours glowing in an iridescent opener to a daringly programmed LPO season.Neither work has been without its drawbacks in my opera-house experience. Zemlinsky’s 1917 one-acter paled alongside his masterpiece, The Birthday of the Infanta, in a 1980s Royal Opera double bill. And Strauss’s massive fairy tale about two very different married couples drawing closer over fertility issues loses quite a bit of steam in its third act, where it seems the composer had to wait too long for the libretto from his ""house poet"" Hugo von Hofmannsthal and lost interest. You can sidestep the problem if, like Jurowski, you piece together a 50-minute symphonic picture, but others potentially take its place. Will the bleeding chunks join to form a slimmer operatic body? Can the passages without vocal infill stand alone?In the end it turned out to be an absorbing exercise in orchestral colour, and not just in getting to see where such exotic (and expensive) extras as the four tenor tubas, two celestas, glass harmonica and assorted exotic percussion fit into the panavision fabric. In concentrating on the supernatural rather than human aspects of the drama, Jurowski balanced impressionistic reverie with impeccable poise and shone a weird light less on Mr and Mrs Barak than on the airier-fairier Emperor and Empress. Though their Act Two crises stopped short of each crux, there was leisure to examine the Empress’s ultimate challenge in deciding whether or not to take the mortal woman’s shadow, shorn of its spoken melodrama but uncut in its lurid, polytonal nightmare as it rarely is in the opera house.Jurowski imposed admirable restraint on the shimmering and twittering of Strauss's fertile happy end; here at least no one in the audience would have needed supertitle directions (elsewhere, signposts like ""the voices of unborn children sing from the frying pan"" might have been helpful). Poised solos from cellist Kristina Blaumane and leader Pieter Schoeman had space to caress, and Paul Benniston’s exquisite handling of the high-lying first trumpet part stood as a subtle emblem of this immaculate interpretation.After the interval, Zemlinsky’s short, sensual shocker resumed the orchestral ferment with mostly less memorable material than Strauss’s, but plenty of dramatic light and shade effortlessly manoeuvred by Jurowski. Instrumental illustration of the overripe Wildean imagery – flutes fluttertonguing as a flight of moths, lower instruments stalking protagonist Simone’s prison-house soul – kept the textures lively. Riding the orchestra’s superabundance of opulent silks were Heike Wessels (pictured above right) - a voluptuous mezzo of whom we wanted to hear more, and certainly will in future – Sergei Skorokhodov as the clarion aristocrat lover who tries to buy her from the husband he disdains and Albert Dohmen as the lugubrious merchant with death on his mind.It’s Simone’s show, and Dohmen, a great Wotan and Barak, never had to force his malleable bass-baritone, though it must have been tempting with the LPO seething unrestrained around him. What a pleasure to hear such relaxed engagement of a top-notch voice, and how suavely Jurowski’s magnificent orchestra reflected back Dohmen's ease of delivery on its way to the sado-masochistic denouement.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/london-philharmonic-orchestra-jurowski-royal-festival-hall-2,5
586,"Jephtha, Welsh National Opera",Jephtha,Welsh National Opera,2012-09-23,stephen Walsh,"Reviewing the Buxton Festival production of Handel’s Jephtha on theartsdesk a couple of months ago, Philip Radcliffe complained that the director, Frederic Wake-Walker, had done too little to justify the staging of this, the composer’s last oratorio: had made it, that is, too static and unstagey. I wonder what Radcliffe would say about Katie Mitchell’s production for Welsh National Opera, revived this weekend by Robin Tebbutt, and a classic case of a director’s reluctance to allow an essentially statuesque, slow-moving work its natural space and pace.Unlike Wake-Walker, who virtually dispensed with costumes and scenery and avoided locating the work in time, Mitchell over-specifies in all these departments. We are in the 1940s, presumably (though this is not entirely clear) at the founding of the state of Israel. Jephtha, you may recall from the Old Testament Book of Judges, is the illegitimate son of a prostitute but a brilliant soldier who is called back by the Israelites to lead them into war against the neighbouring Ammonites. Doubting the strength of his army, he prays for victory, promising God that he will sacrifice the first creature he meets on his return. Alas this turns out to be his own daughter, Iphis; in the bible she is duly sacrificed, in the oratorio, characteristically, a deus ex machina appears in the form of an angel, who lets Jephtha off his vow but decrees instead that Iphis must remain a virgin dedicated to God.The resonances of this tale from an Israeli point of view are interesting. Abraham’s sacrifice of his son, also thwarted by an angel, leads to the symbolic founding of the Jewish nation. Jephtha’s sacrifice has the opposite result, perhaps because, being illegitimate, he can’t be allowed to start a dynasty. Unfortunately, there isn’t much evidence that Handel was concerned with such issues. What interested him, as the music makes plain, was the human dilemma, the torment of the sturdy warrior who unthinkingly destroys the emotional dimension of his life in the interests of a victory that will obliterate his unworthy origins.Even this might seem an interpretation too far. The sacrifice of family for military success was a theme that interested 18th-century composers, and Handel’s treatment of it is fairly conventional, though of course on a far higher plane than anything before Mozart’s Idomeneo.The oratorio genre gave him a pretext for some terrific choruses, not normally possible in opera of the day. But the forms are sculptural, cut in stone, not dramatic in the narrative sense. Fugal choruses and da capo arias (ABA form) don’t go well with the kind of bustling action that Katie Mitchell imposes on them. Above all they conflict with the clichés of modern production: the inevitable stout men in grey suits and trilbies, the women in their drab, calf-length dresses and silly, percher hats, the political apparatus of modern teledrama, the maps and campaign tables, the flash cameras, the servants faffing around with documents and blankets while singers are battling with difficult coloratura. The omnipresent chorus makes nonsense of certain scenes, but can’t be got rid of. As for the “thousands of armed cherubim” who secure Jephtha’s victory, one can only blink at the thought of a modern state that counts on (and gets) this kind of help.Verism, to put it bluntly, is completely out of place. Vicki Mortimer’s designs are brilliant. They would do perfectly for a soap opera about post-war life in an occupied territory. The rapid scene-changes are masterly, miraculous even, like cinematic quick fades (a device already used by this team in Katya Kabanova). All, alas, wasted on Handel, whose pace is from another world.WNO cast the revival solidly. Robert Murray is a dependable if slightly colourless Jephtha, not helped by having to sing his great aria, “Waft her, angels, through the skies”, sitting upstage on the art-deco staircase, and invisible (from my seat) behind a man in a chair with his back to the audience. This is Hamor, Iphis’s fiancé, an alto role well taken by Robin Blaze but also undermined by the modern idiom, which tends to distrust soldiers with girlish voices. Also not helped by such issues is Alan Ewing, as Jephtha’s stolid but ineffectual brother Zebul, and the walk-on part of the rescuing Angel (Claire Ormshaw), a character who might well be useful in the Middle East today (not to mention Brussels), but is usually otherwise engaged.The stars of the show are the Iphis, Fflur Wyn (pictured on page one), the only survivor from the last revival, and Diana Montague, still marvellously focused and secure as her mother, Storgè. Wyn keeps her poise vocally throughout, but is finally defeated dramatically by the interminable scene of her intended sacrifice, which Handel composed for the concert platform, ignoring the needs of the curtained stage.This is a big night for the wonderful WNO chorus, and they acquit themselves superbly on the whole, though their physical presence is sometimes an embarrassment – to them (I suspect) as well as us in the audience. The invisible orchestra, under Paul Goodwin, was not always quite so sure of itself on the first night: much lovely obbligato playing in the arias, some untidiness in the overture and, more surprisingly, in the final act, where coordination with the stage was variable. Not wholly surprising. There was a lot to coordinate.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/jephtha-welsh-national-opera,
587,"Julietta, English National Opera",Julietta,English National Opera,2012-09-18,David Nice,"Pick the right dream, and you just might retrieve a precious memory, even in nightmarish terrain where everyone else has lost theirs. That message seems to have been uncannily prophetic for Bohuslav Martinů, who began work on Julietta in 1936, soon to face the terrifying clean slate of a longer exile from his beloved Czechoslovakia with the onset of the Second World War. The pity and the pain of severance are already there in this seething operatic adaptation of Georges Neveux's crammed-to-bursting dream play. Director Richard Jones holds them effortlessly in the forefront of a production that keeps the dramatic surrealism clear and strong, leaving the more labyrinthine twists and turns to a coruscating ENO Orchestra on top form under music director Edward Gardner.A giant piano accordion dominates the stage in Antony McDonald's stunningly simple designs, differently (de)constructed for the three acts' respective town, forest and Office of Dreams. It's an apt metaphor, for the accordion tune heard minutes into the opera is a partial aide-memoire for the inhabitants of the dreamville into which Michel, Sartre-alike bookseller from Paris, has sleepwalked. Warm, nostalgic music, which in Martinů's alchemical hands has more than a hint of his native land, provides partial relief for a collective amnesia which our age recognises with some anxiety as collective Alzheimer's.In a queasy little vignette, two old people visit a bar to be comforted by a wine waiter with an imaginary past they can't remember; a lushly-scored vision of a romantic Spanish holiday that never happened takes the fancy of the chimerical Julietta and gets Michel out of a sticky situation. The flyaway absurdity of Michel's encounters is anchored only by the incandescent moment he recalls of hearing a girl's voice at a piano through an open window: the purpose of his dream-visit, crucially remembered in each act. The most chilling, stilling moment in Jones's production is when Michel's own memory begins to fail after a crisis in which he may, or may not, have shot his beloved Julietta.The role calls for the most accomplished of singing actors, and tenor Peter Hoare, following his triumph as the man-beast Sharikov in ENO's equally disconcerting production of A Dog's Heart, follows in Philip Langridge's footsteps by matching a naturalism that makes Michel's dream horribly real with singing of infallible brilliance, subtle when need be, the text perfectly enunciated.Verbal clarity throughout matches the off-kilter simplicity of Jones's concept, and with the aid of movement director Philippe Giraudeau, this most musically fine-tuned of directors makes sure that stylised steps constantly breaking into odd little dances inform the hard-working performances of the entire cast. A trio of mini-me Michels (Emilie Renard, Clare Presland and Samantha Price) spookily stalk the chief dreamer, at one point balletically transformed into the crocodile image Julietta has conjured to mock her idealistic suitor as the orchestra goes berserk. Julietta herself, lustrously sung by the generous Julia Sporsén (pictured with Hoare above right), is no pale idol but a slightly scary tease flipping between jerky and fluid gestures.Crystal-clear vignettes in multiple roles come from other fine music-theatre performers, including Andrew Shore, who gets to camp it up à l'Espagnol as the seller of photographic memories, Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts as several faces of officialdom and Susan Bickley as an hysterical fortune teller who, you've guessed it, reads the past and not the future.Above all, though, it is the orchestra which carries Martinů's unnerving fluctuation between brittle absurdity and burgeoning sincerity. Gardner keeps a tight, Stravinsky-style rein on the pastiches of the funny little quacking-duck number in Act One and the more acidulous moments of the second act's quick-changing forest kaleidoscope, a sequence whose end is impossible to predict as a number of high-point resolutions come and go. In a deliberate disjunction with the mechanics of Jones's stage action, Gardner conducts the love-music with opulent abandon and creates magic in the first two curtains, even as the lights go up to wake the audience, and by implication Michel too, from the dream (only a few were inclined to fidget).Finally, he strikes the depths as the music underlines the last act's sinister message: those who want to live forever in their dreams are lost to life. The drop-curtain of a sleeping Michel in various positions spelling out ""Julietta"" returns him to sleep; he prefers to re-enact his visit to dreamland. The repeated images from Act One and the failure of the now-expected lights-up on the auditorium freeze the blood, but the orchestra simultaneously thaws it with a final benediction over a love that may be regained, if only in another world. The fusion of sound and vision is masterly, disconcerting to the last. There have been quite a few special pleadings for Julietta in recent years, not least David Pountney's cluttered but ultimately moving production for Opera North; this is the one which ought to restore the opera to its rightful place at the centre of the 20th century operatic repertoire.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/julietta-english-national-opera,
588,"BBC Proms: Peter Grimes, English National Opera/ BBC Symphony Orchestra, Knussen",BBC Proms: Peter Grimes,English National Opera/ BBC Symphony Orchestra,2012-08-26,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"After the all-singing, all-dancing, all-helicoptering brilliance of Stockhausen Mittwoch aus Licht, the dry routine of an opera in concert didn't seem a very enticing prospect.  That's the problem with this year's Cultural Olympiad. We're becoming very spoilt by it. What should have been a mouth-watering prospect - a fantastic cast performing a great opera - suddenly began to feel run-of-the-mill when compared to the once-in-a-lifetime event that was Mittwoch. But my concerns were short-lived.I saw and loved the original ENO production of Peter Grimes, Benjamin Britten's brilliant cautionary tale about little England. And, though the ENO didn't do as much as other companies often do to resurrect the look and feel of productions that they're bringing to the Royal Albert Hall, the cast retained as much of the dramatic tension and surreal character of the original David Alden staging as they could. Memories of the production were strong, however. And I began to yearn for some visual activity in the First Act, where the lack of dramatic momentum in the libretto slightly drags.Then again, who needs sets when you have Ed Gardner and the ENO Orchestra. His shaping of the music was vivid, alert, muscular and magisterially long-sighted. This was music one could see as well as hear. The surety of the orchestra no doubt helped the cast and the choir focus on delivering the complexities of the drama so compellingly and fluently.With Amanda Roocroft far from her best as Ellen Orford (Grimes' champion), the night belonged to Stuart Skelton's Peter Grimes, whose eloquence and elegance of voice was breath-taking and whose characterisation couldn't have been bettered. The paralysing confusion that grips Grimes as misfortunes and mistakes push the village into a witch hunt against him was played without cliche or extremity and touched us all.Roocroft (pictured right) was less impressive than I remember her in the original production. Her voice wasn't working for her. Iain Paterson, however, made a fine Balstrode, and delivered the lines that send Grimes to his grave with great skill. Though the nieces were never going to make the impact that they did in the original production where they slithered about eerily like the twins from The Shining, Gillian Ramm and Mairead Buicke were still nicely peculiar, as was Rebecca de Pont Davies's eccentric Auntie. Mark Richardson was a decent last minute stand in for an indisposed Matthew Best as Swallow. But it was Leigh Melrose's shady Ned Keene and Dame Felciity Palmer's prying Mrs Sedley that our eyes were constantly drawn to.We mustn't forget the townsfolk. They make this opera. And the ENO Chorus (under the direction of the chorus master Aidan Oliver) delivered every blast of indignation, nosiness and hypocrisy with brilliantly committed and authentic little Englander venom.The story of what happened next in British 20th-century composition was the subject of last night's Prom. Composer-conductor Oliver Knussen offered us a piece of ballet music from Alexander Goehr, a new work from one of our brighter younger things, Helen Grime, and one of his own symphonies, the third, next to some little heard ballet music by Claude Debussy, The Martyrdom of St Sebastian.Unusually for Knussen, it was a ragbag collection, the quality of the music fluctuating between (as well as within) the works. Connections were hard to find. Shortness alone seemed to link Knussen's precocious Third Symphony, written when he was in his early 20s, and Grime's new orchestral nocturne, Night Songs. Shortness, and perhaps also immaturity. The sure-footedness and generosity that is such a characteristic of much of Knussen's output wasn't yet there when he wrote this piece. Too much gets lost in elliptical cleverness and compactness. Everything was lost on Knussen in Grime's work. His glasses, he informed us, had slipped off his nose during the performance and he had no idea what had been going on. ""I think everything went ok but I'd like to perform it again just to make sure,"" he said. Normally a work benefits from a second listen. With this one, it simply served to reaffirm the fact that this was a very neat, very careful and very safe little work, with a cute little rhythmic motor and a not unpleasant melody.The maundering ways of Debussy's dance piece on the martyrdom of St Sebastian, you really have to be in the right mood for. If, as with me last night, you're not, you can begin to feel like a martyr yourself. You also start to wonder what Debussy was playing at, allowing such long stretches of music to brood so interminably over such thin material. Was the tortuousness deliberate? Was it his way of trying to impress upon us Sebastian's plight? Or was he just having an off day? Only some delicious singing from Claire Booth stopped me from nodding off completely. Praise be, then, to Sandy Goehr. Though it gets a little clogged half way through, his Metamorphosis/Dancefrom the early 1970s was clear and jaunty and full of interesting coloristic effects. Now here was a piece that deserved a second hearing. If only someone had knocked  Knussen's glasses off.Follow @IgorToronyi on Twitter",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/bbc-proms-peter-grimes-english-national-opera-bbc-symphony-orchestra-knussen,
589,"Ravel Double Bill, Glyndebourne Festival Opera",Ravel Double Bill,Glyndebourne Festival Opera,2012-08-05,stephen Walsh,"Ravel composed only two operas, both one-acters, widely separated in time, superficially very different, but both in a way about the same thing: naughtiness. In L’Heure espagnole (1911), the clockmaker’s wife, Conceptión, entertains a succession of would-be lovers in her husband’s absence. In L’Enfant et les sortilèges (1924), the little boy who won’t do his homework, who smashes the teapot, pulls the cat’s tail and rips the wallpaper, suddenly finds his victims coming to life and scaring him to death.Naughtiness, rather than wickedness: Torquemada, the clockmaker, turns a blind eye on his wife’s peccadilloes because they help him sell clocks; the boy is redeemed by tending an injured squirrel’s paw. It’s the world of Feydeau farces and children’s pantomime – an enchanted world free of painful outcomes; and Ravel provided music to match, all froth and gesture in the clock-shop, all pizazz and sentiment in L’Enfant. It’s hard to see either piece as the work of “an infinitely greater 20th-century composer than Debussy or Stravinsky,” to quote Rodney Milnes’s wonderfully tongue-in-cheek programme note (naughtiness again). But nobody ever wrote music of greater wit or stylishness, or offered the stage director and designer better chances to display their art without the need for obscure Conceptións of their own. At Glyndebourne these chances have been embraced with open arms.Caroline Ginet and Florence Evrard turn Torquemada’s establishment into a colourful junk shop rich in clutter of every kind: clocks with faces that light up or hands that whizz round, plates on the walls, guitars on the floor (even the exit signs that the director, Laurent Pelly, was not allowed to remove so made a virtue of). The whole thing is a delight to the eye, in much the way that Ravel delights the ear with his musical bric-à-brac, gasping phrases that lead nowhere in particular, harp swirls and clarinet arpeggios, that whole compendium of Gallic Iberiana he had already drawn on in piano works like Habañera or Alborada del gracioso: style without a great deal of content, but so skilfully and tastefully handled that one scarcely notices its essential weightlessness.L’Heure espagnole is by no means performance proof. I’ve seen adequate productions that leave the music’s refinement fighting for its life. But not here. Pelly’s direction is straightforward, alert, musical, timed to perfection, just sufficiently overstated, intensely witty. It had the audience in stitches and, by the end, bubbling with pleasure. And musically the performance is a model of idiomatic sparkle, conducted with sublime precision by Kazushi Ono, and tossed off without a tremor by the London Philharmonic Orchestra.Stéphanie d’Oustrac’s Conceptión is immaculate in every respect except her behaviour: exquisitely sung, man-hungry to the point of willingness to descend from the poet (Gonzalve: Alek Shrader, a masterly Spanish Bunthorne, all hair and verbiage) to the muleteer Ramiro (Elliot Madore), muscular and mindless, barely able to tell the difference between humping clocks and bonking clockmakers’ wives. François Piolino’s Torquemada (pictured above right) floats through these encounters with sovereign unconcern (“you won’t need clocks any more,” he blandly assures his wife, while instructing her lover to “tell her the time” as he goes by every morning). Paul Gay’s banker Don Iñigo Gómez, likewise excellent, spends much of the Spanish hour coffined in a grandfather clock and has to be levered out by Ramiro: quantitative easing indeed. And he has to buy the clock…L’Enfant et les sortilèges normally emerges from the double-bill as the stronger work. But for once, here, that isn’t clearly the case. It has more memorable music, more substance, no doubt. But Colette’s libretto is not without its problems: strong and inventive so long as it preserves the revue structure of the first scene, tending to drift into sentimentality in the garden scene, where nature rounds on the boy, then marvels at the “humanity” with which he bandages the squirrel (in this production a bird, which seems to miss the point that it’s the squirrel he has injured at the start).Pelly’s staging, with unforgettable designs by Barbara de Limburg (costumes here and in L’Heure espagnole by Pelly himself with Jean-Jacques Delmotte), responds to these strengths and weaknesses. The first scene is sheer brilliance: the child (Khatouna Gadelia) utterly convincing, tiny on an outsize chair and table (pictured above), across which the broken teapot (Piolino again) and Chinese cup (Elodie Méchain) cavort suggestively; the irresistible scene of the torn wallpaper and the bereft toile de jouy shepherds and shepherdesses; and much, much else. All quite magical.In the garden the designs are scarcely less inventive; the ideas flow. But the music gives them less to work with. Some kind of dramatic climax, some sense of growth are needed but never come; so in the end the child’s new leaf seems gratuitous (and probably won’t stay turned): sentimentality – in James Joyce’s definition – as unearned emotion. Even so Pelly, Limburg and co. remain supremely watchable, imaginative and sensitive to detail. Once again the musical performance is nonpareil: far too many singers to list, a real company effort on the highest level, several roles doubled, and without a noticeable weakness. And Kazushi Ono again presides with discreet mastery and a feeling for the light touch without which Ravel would not be Ravel.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/ravel-double-bill-glyndebourne-festival-opera,
590,"Susanna, Iford Manor",Susanna,Iford Manor,2012-07-29,stephen Walsh,"Not all geese are swans, and not all Handel oratorios are like Messiah – storyless, spiritual, monumental sequences of reflective arias and choruses. By definition, though, they aren’t operas either, and it’s always a calculated risk to put them on the stage, as Iford Arts are doing with Susanna, a quasi-oratorio that Christopher Hogwood has described as “a pastoral opera verging on the comic”.The production’s director, Pia Furtado, would probably question that description. Iford Manor, near Bath, does, it’s true, have a pastoral touch. One looks out from Harold Peto’s wonderful semi-formal hillside garden onto green fields and woods straight from some Arcadian idyll. But in the tiny cloister where the opera happens, Furtado and her designer Georgia Lowe have created an enclosed, tense community of priestly devotees who solemnise the marriage of two of their number, Susanna and Joacim, then react with bewilderment and judicial cruelty to her alleged adultery (she has, in fact, been raped by her accusers), until a young acolyte, Daniel (of lion’s den fame), steps forward and, with a simple forensic trick, exposes the false witness. The ending is happy but it is hard won. Of comedy there is no trace.Handel’s story comes from the apocryphal book of Susanna, which it follows closely. Susanna is not sexually assaulted but merely threatened with a perjured charge of fornication if she refuses to submit. In Furtado, by contrast, she is raped, and very violently, and the production’s closing scenes explore the psychological consequences of this crime: the guilt and self-loathing of its victim, the troubled doubts of her husband, the ambivalence of the community towards the young man who has seen more clearly than they have the falseness of the charge and how to expose it.This all makes perfect sense; but unfortunately it’s contradicted at many turns by the score. Handel’s music for the “rape” scene is brisk and energetic, but not violent or invasive. The Second Elder’s song is almost – not quite – comic; the First Elder’s is blissful, in a curious way innocent (he is, after all, genuinely in love). Their trio is like a musical chase round a mulberry bush. And nothing in the final scene suggests torment or a troubled conscience. Susanna remains defiant, not crushed; Daniel is a simple 18th century deus ex machina, and the rest is comfortable resolution. Actually, if I were one of the wicked Elders, I’d counter-accuse Daniel as the young man they say they saw with Susanna. But probably that’s being frivolous.So Furtado overstrains the piece. But she does it with some brilliance, maintaining tension and mobility throughout much of a work which, in its Handelian way, tends to freeze-frame at every moment, with its incessant da capos and its oratorian lack of genuine action. And what a richly fascinating score it is. On the one hand, its music is less sophisticated than that of the Italian operas, closer in style to the 18th-century songs in the National Song Book, with their neat rhyming couplets – a response, I suppose, to the English language in a pastoral setting (think of “Drink to me only” or “Where the bee sucks”). On the other hand, it’s richer in texture, fuller in sound than his typical operatic music, where everything defers to the voice.Religious music, in the broadest sense, drew something new out of Handel. Polyphony and complex orchestral texturing – a nuisance in the theatre – were just the job in church: they went with earnest ceremony and spiritual engagement. At Iford, the Early Opera Company orchestra, under Christian Curnyn (pictured above) occupies half of one side of the cloister; sitting near it, you turn your head constantly to see the source of these amazing string colours and elaborate, often chromatic harmonies. Forget the simple categories: Bach equals counterpoint, Handel equals tunes. Even Susanna, no tragedy and no more than obliquely sacred, is in many respects a learned work, even if its “learning” is that of a genius whose instinct was always to be showy and theatrical.Nor does the voice get neglected. Like all Handel (even the ""Hallelujah"" chorus), this is difficult, demanding music, technically, to sing. It needs careful casting and scrupulous preparation, and at Iford it gets them. I take my hat off to young singers who can throw these bravura arias off while pursuing each other round a narrow cloister garth: hard enough to sing such things standing still facing a theatre or church audience who can barely see your face; quite another matter to have them practically in your pocket while you walk the equivalent of a musical tightrope across the Niagara Falls. Yet there are few slips, and certainly nothing fatal. The only casualty is the text, usually indecipherable. But if you know it, you may not be so sorry not to hear it.Outstanding in this regard is the Joacim of Christopher Lowrey, a counter-tenor (castrato) role that would often in the recent past have been sung by a female alto. But he is brilliantly supported by Ciara Hendrick as Susanna (pictured above), so comprehensively manhandled by her two assailants in Act II that it’s amazing she manages to sing at all thereafter. Yet her final duet with Lowrey would stop the show if the Iford audience were not so sedate and well-mannered.Also excellent are the naughty Elders, John McMunn and Simon Robinson, Olympians in voice and action: musical pentathletes who can sing as they sin. Sam Evans is a fine sturdy Chelsias – Susanna’s father; and Daisy Brown, though somewhat white-voiced for my taste, is a touching, youthful Daniel, who only gets to sing in the last act (though Furtado is careful to bring her/him into the action from the start). Writing an oratorio, Handel didn’t trouble himself with continuities of this kind. For a director they are a headache; but the music is a very effective aspirin.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/susanna-iford-manor,
591,"BBC Proms: Les Troyens, Royal Opera House Orchestra, Pappano",BBC Proms: Les Troyens,Royal Opera House Orchestra,2012-07-23,Charlotte Gardner,"Last night's concert performance of Berlioz's Les Troyens was not a Prom for the fainthearted. After all, if sitting through a five-hour opera had been a daunting undertaking for the Covent Garden audiences last month - who could also enjoy David McVicar's eye-catching staging - then it was inevitable that anyone seated in the Royal Albert Hall for the visually pared-down version was expecting to feel very culturally virtuous by the end of the night. With its Trojan horses, ballets and massive crowd scenes, this grand five-act opera based on the fall of Troy and establishment of Rome is both a director's nightmare and an audience's dream, demanding high-octane visuals on top of the ravishing music. Still, if ever an opera were going to work in the cavernous Royal Albert Hall then it would be Les Troyens. First, there are the sheer forces involved, with its huge orchestra requiring three harps, and the full-scale chorus playing as central a role as the main soloists. Then, there's Berlioz's incredible score encompassing everything from grand operatic through to symphonic style, with far more solo orchestral work than is usual for an opera orchestra to get its teeth stuck into. Lastly, it's just the sheer emotional investment that Berlioz poured into this, his career-culminating homage to an obsession that began in his boyhood Latin lessons. “I imagined they knew me, so well did I know them,” he said of the characters of Virgil's Aeneid, and the Shakesperean-scale opera he crafted around them has a range of expression and dramatic power that demands hearing, whether you're into Berlioz or not, and whether you get to see it in its fully staged version or have to content yourself with the music alone. The BBC Proms did a brilliant thing by including it in the 2012 season. The many who turned up for this epic afternoon-cum-evening experienced both the best and the worst of what a concert performance can do to an opera. While Anna Caterina Antonacci gave one of the performances of the night as Cassandra - dramatically expressive with gorgeous vocals - she was very much a lone agent in the first two acts, which were too marred by the feeling that this was a cast stunted by their new concert environment into half-hearted acting, cursory wooden-hand gestures and a lack of interaction between characters, all in the midst of some of the most thrilling, chilling scenes the opera has to offer. Thankfully however, with the opening of Act Three everything changed.Perhaps it was Eva-Maria Westbroek's vivacious Dido (pictured right with Bryan Hymel as Aeneas. Photograph Chris Christodoulou), or perhaps there had just been a back-stage pow-wow. Whatever it was, Carthage opened up in all its glory as Westbroek paced the stage with Hanna Hipp as Anna, the two women finally doing what should have been happening all along, concert performance or no, namely, feeling their roles, reacting to each other and engaging with the chorus. It felt like the first duet of the night, and from that moment the opera came to life, as if the rest of the cast were galvanised by the new energy on stage. In all, some voices filled their new, huge acoustic better than others. In fact, some of the best and interesting vocal performances came courtesy of the cameo roles, such as Ji-Min Park's Iopas, and the strong vocal and dramatic presence of Hipp's Anna. Under the direction of Antonio Pappano, the orchestra itself took a little time to sound comfortable in its skin, but was pushing all the right buttons far more swiftly than the solo vocalists, glittering, thundering, dancing and making love across Berlioz's myriad of different textures and genres, smoothly changing stylistic tack to deal out fresh contrasts. The one constant throughout were the voices of the chorus, whose brilliance in conveying the range of feelings and dynamics required of them was truly superlative.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/bbc-proms-les-troyens-royal-opera-house-orchestra-pappano,
592,"The Fairy Queen, Glyndebourne Festival Opera",The Fairy Queen,Glyndebourne Festival Opera,2012-07-21,alexandra Coghlan,"Purcell certainly doesn’t make it easy for the champions of English opera. His beloved Dido and Aeneas is barely half an evening’s entertainment, so condensed is its tragedy, and the dense political satire of Dryden’s King Arthur text all but requires translation if it is to make sense to a contemporary audience. And then there’s The Fairy Queen – the gauzy, gorgeous semi-opera whose music is the side-dish to a bastardised 17th-century take on Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream.With Purcell’s music for the latter valued above its rhyming-couplet dialogue, it’s rare to see the work today except in purely musical form. Purcell’s cast of rustics, gods and spirits can be summoned evocatively enough on the concert platform, but their charms are nothing to the vivid intensity of Jonathan Kent’s fully realised staging.Original text and music all but intact, his Glyndebourne production comes in at over three hours, putting perhaps a little too much strain on the flimsy dramatic structure. But so generous is Kent’s magical vision, so bursting with visual delights and distractions, that it seems churlish to balk at too much of a good thing.The scene is set in a domed 17th-century drawing room – a private museum, complete with cabinets of curiosities on either side. Laden with the souvenirs of empire – Chinese vases, bright twigs of coral, animal skulls and feathery fans – these carefully constrained mysteries contrast with Purcell’s cheeky spirits and nature-gods, whose magic bursts forth from within the glass cases as the evening progresses.Roughing up the edges of this period vision (fulfilled most amply by the quartet of lovers, with Matt Barber's Lysander, Hedydd Dylan's Helena and Alice Haig's Hermia pictured right) are Kent’s rude mechanicals – agency cleaners complete with dodgy hoover and duster-covered shoes. Their playfully anachronistic presence finds echo in a Hymen who becomes a disapproving vicar (Sainsbury’s carrier bag clutched in hand) and a final wedding feast that’s pure 1950s. And this is before we get to a lusty, cross-dressing Corydon and Mopsa and, of course, the legendary chorus of shagging rabbits.It’s a riot, but not one without its moments of delicacy and beauty. Lawrence Cummings, chief among the gutsiest and most invigorating of period specialists, sets aside rougher textures for the most tender account of Purcell’s score, favouring sweetness and legato sway over brusquer articulation. Dance rhythms are tight and clean but heard as though from another world, transfigured like Shakespeare’s own mortals in this enchanted wood. These are mirrored in Kim Brandstrup’s sensitive choreography and Paul Brown’s designs that summon golden winged horses from the central cupola, weave Titania into a spidery shroud for her rest, and set Bottom and his fairy queen afloat in a pea-pod boat complete with goldfish boatman.With so much visual energy, and a cast of actors in the named roles (led by the dynamic Penny Downie as Titania and Finbar Lynch’s edgy Oberon), the singers occupy supporting roles. Emotions are fleshed out, pageantry enacted in their verses, as masque after masque reveals pairs of lovers, a parade of the seasons, and a bedtime story of night and day.With Carolyn Sampson (cruelly under-used, save for a wrenching “O let me weep”), Claire Debono and Joelle Harvey anchoring the musical set-pieces, the rest of the roles fall to younger singers, with mixed results. The women outclass the men by some margin, with tenor solos leaving me yearning for 2009’s Ed Lyon. Only bass David Soar stands out among a competent but unexciting cast, whose comparative vocal inexperience is balanced by a dramatic freshness and the excellence of the ensemble singing.Jonathan Kent here transforms an awkward semi-opera into a generous more-than-opera, creating pageantry for our own age in his endless, imaginative parade of spirits and creatures. It’s a joy to see design, choreography and musical direction so tightly synchronised, each celebrating and enabling the other to create dramatic unity out of this most fragmented of works. A truly English summer treat, right up there with strawberries and cream.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/fairy-queen-glyndebourne-festival-opera,
593,"Götterdämmerung, Longborough Festival",Götterdämmerung,Longborough Festival,2012-07-18,stephen Walsh,"Every production of Wagner’s Ring is a challenge. But to stage it in a smallish converted barn seating 500 with little or no stage machinery, which is what the Longborough Festival plans to do in a year’s time, might strike one as a particularly refined form of lunacy. The omens, nevertheless, could hardly be better. The final wing of the edifice, Götterdämmerung, is complete; and in almost every way it’s a remarkable, memorable achievement, a triumph of sheer enthusiasm and dedication – a rare victory for the fools rushing in ahead of the timid angels.No need to dwell on the obvious limitations. The point about Alan Privett’s production and Anthony Negus’s conducting is that they make a virtue of them. Once upon a time Karl Böhm, himself a great Wagner conductor, described The Ring as chamber music, and we all laughed. But in this confined space, with a reduced orchestra of 70 or so, Negus is able to show what Böhm meant.From the very start, with the three Norns, he restrains the orchestra, allowing the detail to come through and the voices to carry without shouting. And this fine balance is maintained throughout. Even at Bayreuth, I’ve never heard the voices or words so well in Wagner; and there’s another interesting consequence. In a small auditorium, casting assumes a different complexion; you no longer have to depend on thumping “Wagner” sopranos or tenors in every minor role. You can bring in authentic lyrical voices, and have the music sung as it must surely have been conceived, as a kind of extension of late Schubert – a blend of line and expressive colour.No barking, not a squawk to be heard: maybe the odd voice not quite up to the specific gravity of this or that moment. But in general this is a model of how well Wagner lies on the vocal chords when they aren’t being drowned out by a symphony orchestra in full cry.Privett has his Norns 12 feet up in the air on wheeled cherry-pickers, lending them a touchingly fragile air, but also giving them space and carry. The idea sounds grotesque, but is in fact oddly moving, in a mildly nightmarish way. The singing, by Catherine King, Sara Wallander-Ross and Meta Powell, is lucid and eloquent. But this is nothing compared to the astonishing warmth and richness of Rachel Nicholls’ Brünnhilde (pictured below right) and the vitality of Mati Turi’s Siegfried when they emerge from their “cave”.Needless to say the designer, Kjell Torriset, offers nothing so literal. What we do get in this prologue is a closeness and intimacy of a kind usually quite foreign to Wagner. The whole relationship suddenly becomes a matter of facial expression and discreet gesture; and both singers make full use of these resources, almost as in a television play.Similarly the Gibichungs are like characters in a drawing-room melodrama: Gunther (Eddie Wade) suited and tied and for some reason in a wheelchair, until released, apparently, by Siegfried’s drinking of the forgetfulness potion; Hagen (Stuart Pendred) more chic in a green house-coat; Gutrune (Lee Bisset) dressed for dinner in a well-regulated household, which, it soon turns out, this is not.Siegfried’s arrival is the intrusion of myth into a world of bankers and the smart disabled. And almost without exception the singing is fluent and articulate, Wade especially good, utterly convincing as the moral coward who connives at a deception that he lacks the courage to admit even to himself; Pendred occasionally dry of voice but immensely plausible in his villainy; Bisset, perfect as the ordinary girl landed in a situation beyond her comprehension.The vignettes are also excellent: Malcolm Rivers, a veteran Alberich in every sense, wonderfully sinister and vocally precise in his nocturnal visitation of Hagen, in Wagner’s blackest B flat minor; Alison Kettlewell inclined to overact as Waltraute, but secure of voice and intense of character.She knows how to act with her voice, her body and her faceNone of this, though, would carry much weight without the three main stars of the show. Nicholls’ Brünnhilde is in every way an extraordinary creation. Well-known as a baroque and classical soprano with extensions (she was a Valkyrie here two years ago and a Flower Maiden at Covent Garden), she emerges now as a dramatic soprano of real brilliance and intense expressive power. The voice is clean, bright, but with dark colourings, strong in the low register, firm and secure on top, and with a fluency of line that even the greatest Wagner sopranos sometimes miss. She can also act. She knows how to act with her voice, her body and her face; quite simply she has presence. In the immolation she commands the stage (and to his credit Privett lets her do so). At other times she is the wronged heroine, vulnerable and bewildered. She reminds us that Wagner, among other minor talents, was a penetrating psychologist. It’s one of the most affecting performances I can remember.Mati Turi (pictured left), though, is her ideal foil. Large without grossness, spirited without stupidity, he manages to persuade us that Siegfried is something more than a blank Aryan clod. Part of this is in the singing, which is remarkably sound and assured for so apparently inexperienced a tenor. But there is also a quick intelligence in his acting, and a certain vividness in the way he responds to this baffling chain of events. When these two are on stage together, whether loving or hating, they make compelling music theatre: one can’t ask much more.The third hero, of course, is in the pit. Negus’s achievement in piloting the singers and orchestra through this perilous masterpiece is impossible to overpraise. He has the breath of the music, its pace and architecture. But he is also attentive to both his singers and his players – the virtue, I suppose, of years of repetiteuring, coaching, and rehearsing for other people. Securing balance in Wagner is notoriously hard; he achieves it. The choral singing, by a small but well-drilled group, is immaculate. The orchestra is very good, but it isn’t perfect; there are problems of tuning and splitting in the wind and brass, in among much lovely, well coordinated playing. All this will improve, under a talented conductor who, over the years, has never received his due in mainstream opera houses..Of the staging, I’ve said the best. The setting is neutral: a bit of this and a bit of that. A large Wieland Wagner disc that tilts for the end of the world; various assorted things on wheels, Rhinemaidens climbing up fish netting, a horse whinnying offstage, a few flaming brands at the end. Not a tree or a blade of grass or a splash of water to be seen, for music that begins and ends in Nature. But Privett does his best work with the most important props of all, the singers. It’s the least spectacular part of the director’s job, but the one most frequently muffedGötterdämmerung at Longborough Festival on 19, 22 and 24 July",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/g%C3%B6tterd%C3%A4mmerung-longborough-festival,
594,"The Turn of the Screw, Buxton Festival",The Turn of the Screw,Buxton Festival,2012-07-17,philip Radcliffe,"Appearing at Buxton for the first time, Northern Ireland Opera are ahead of the game in marking next year’s Britten centenary by turning their attention to The Turn of the Screw. It is only their fifth production since the company was formed in 2010, so they are nothing if not adventurous. Being a chamber opera, the Screw suits their modest forces well, as it does the venue of Buxton Opera House. First staged at La Fenice in 1954, the claustrophobic opera benefits from an intimate theatre to make the most of its spookiness.Henry James loved ghost stories and the 1898 novella on which Britten’s work is based beats them all. Even at the end, we are left wondering whether the apparitions are “real” or just figments of the Governess’s febrile imagination if not extensions of her own personality. This is the opera’s holding power.Is the governess, put in charge of the two orphans, Miles and Flora in a big country house, protective or possessive? Is the boy Miles abused or up to no good? What are the sexual secrets hidden within the spooky walls and in the ghost-trodden garden of Bly? Riddles abound and the multi-layered suspense sustains the hypnotic attention.Director Oliver Mears has it gripped in a compelling, thought-through production. He shifts it from the Victorian era to the time it was written, getting rid of the Gothic and the melodrama. He stages it in a cavernous interior set, all in grey, with bare walls and bare floor. Furniture, moved in and out seamlessly by the performers, is minimal. It is dramatically lit by Kevin Treacy, with shafts of bright light creating sharp angles, deep recesses and shadows on the wall. And the apparitions at the rear window are spookily realised.The company’s 13-strong chamber orchestra, conducted by Nicholas Chalmers, embraces all the intricacies of this most atmospheric score. The singing and characerisation are exceptional. As The Governess, Fiona Murphy (pictured above right) is in fine voice, singing with conviction and catching the emotional rollercoaster experienced by being exposed to an alien environment, with two complex children and the apparitions of her predecessor Miss Jessel and former valet Peter Quint. She sings movingly of the condition she fears, being “locked in a labyrinth"". She strives for affection, she cares about the children, she fights the demons that have gone before.The remarkable Thomas Copeland (pictured left with Lucia Vernon), aged 13, fills the part of the mysterious Miles superbly and has a lively companion in Lucia Vernon as Flora. Giselle Allen’s Miss Jessel is a feisty apparition, matched by Andrew Tortise’s Quint. Yvonne Howard brings to the homely role of Mrs Grose, the housekeeper who never quite accepts The Governess and eventually takes Flora away form her, quiet authority.With Mears, the action is a well-paced slow burn. He makes his points dramatically, as in the innovation of having The Governess as a distracted spectator in the pivotal bedroom scene in which the children are visited by the ghosts of Quint and Jessel.And it builds to a dramatic and touching climax as Miles identifies evil, naming Quint as the devil, before expiring in the arms of The Governess. And she sings out that one dreaded word – “alone”. What Mears does here is to revisit and revivify James’s original ghost story. For all the debate and looked-for undercurrents, old Henry, as was his wont, wrote a good old spooky yarn. I can’t help thinking that he has the last laugh. After all the struggles he had to get his work on the stage, he would surely have relished the fact that this short story, adapted and embellished in such masterly style by Britten, assures him of a theatrical presence today.          ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/turn-screw-buxton-festival,4
595,"BBC Proms: Pelléas et Mélisande, Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique, Gardiner",BBC Proms: Pelléas et Mélisande,Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique,2012-07-16,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"How silly an armchair looks in the Royal Albert Hall - like a rubber duck floating in the Pacific. Yet how right it was for those behind this excellent semi- staged Proms performance of Debussy's Pelléas et Mélisande to try to recreate a bit of fin-de-siècle intimacy for this most intensely intimate of operas. And how appropriate also for there to be a couch on stage in a work that is, and has always been, a psychoanalyst's dream.But it wasn't just the furniture that suggested that we were being given entry to an interior world. Everything about the way this symbolist drama played out last night pointed to the possibility that the drama was in fact a Freudian dream being conjured up not by Pelléas or Mélisande but by the third man in this relationship, Prince Golaud. The work opens on Laurent Naouri's Golaud twisted in his chair, his eyes closed, his head in his hands. He is the first person on stage and last off it. In between nothing really quite happens - though a lot almost happens. The dramatis personae float in and out of hazy, quasi Medieval scenarios not as fully autonomous humans but as semi-independent participants. To leave Maurice Maeterlinck's delicate drama to the oneiric realm, then, makes plenty of sense. There was no attempt to realise the various medieval elements that make up the narrative. Confining the forest, the cave, the castle and well to the imagination allowed the work to achieve a psychological depth and subtlety that few stage productions manage. The story certainly made more of an effect on me this time than it did when half of this Proms ensemble - Sir John Eliot Gardiner, his Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique, Philip Addis's Pelléas and Karen Vourc’h's Mélisande - were performing the work together at the Opéra Comique in Stéphane Braunschweig's 2010 production. The differences were instructive. Faced with the shoebox theatre that is the Opéra Comique and a lacklustre production, Gardiner let the music swing and sway wildly at the Paris production. Here, in the Royal Albert Hall, in a castle that the forlorn King Arkel could only dream of, Gardiner cleverly adjusted his speeds and his rubato, forcing the music down a steadier but no less exciting path. With the beat slow and steady, each subtle change of colour could be heard more clearly and could tell in the drama more powerfully. Some of the finest moments were to be found in the longer speech-songs, where, to a Sprechstimme-like vocal line, Debussy offers a clever and ever-shifting soundscape behind. This was a form of impressionism mostly of the Cy Twombly and not the Claude Monet kind, full of half-finished minimalist doodlings. Marten Root and Lina Leon's flutes were outstanding in this, as divine at Twombly-ing as they were at Monet-ing, most memorably at the soft close of Act One.But of the many moments of colouristic wonder, two stick out. The shift from a radiant sunniness at the start of Pelléas and Mélisande's investigation of the beach and cave to a cold moonlit scene at the end was handled by Gardiner with such skill it was easy to forget one was indoors. Soon after, Vourc'h's Mélisande scaled the choir area of the orchestra and sung her tower song with ravishing clarity and beauty, accompanied with tremendous delicacy by Gardiner. The cast was strong. Vourc'h may have lacked the otherworldliness needed to fully make sense of this woman's strange unhappiness (and didn't get to that mysterious state of being that Dessay did at the Barbican recently) but her voice was a delight, particularly her sotto voce. Naouri's Golaud was seriously classy, pitch-perfect in his torment, beautifully French in tone and incredible at the extremes of softness and highness where French composers frequently like their male singers to go.Addis was a little aimlessly puppyish as Pelléas, though vocally attractive. Dima Bawab sung Yniold's small part with great beauty, as did Elodie Méchai Geneviève. The only weak link was Sir John Tomlinson's Arkel. That unerring consistency that he usually brings to everything he sings deserted him last night. He seemed outfoxed by Debussy's rhythmic patterns and confused by his role (particularly strange as he has sung it before). Even so, there was power in his rendition of his moving final speech. And the orchestral epilogue, one of the most beautiful passages in all opera, retained all its wisdom and mystery in Gardiner's masterful hands.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/bbc-proms-pell%C3%A9as-et-m%C3%A9lisande-orchestre-r%C3%A9volutionnaire-et-romantique-gardiner,
596,"The Marriage of Figaro, Buxton Festival",The Marriage of Figaro,Buxton Festival,2012-07-16,philip Radcliffe,"Following the three home-grown opera productions, in come the visitors. And so we come to the “other” Figaro, the one by the 18th-century Portuguese composer, Marcos Portugal. This being Buxton and the visiting company being Bampton Classical Opera, fellow-travellers in reviving neglected later 18th-century works, Mozart would be just too, well, common. It’s not all that long ago that we had the “other” Barber of Seville, the Paisiello version here. And we have had several helpings of Cimarosa over the years, from The Secret Marriage to The Italian Girl in London.Marking the 250th anniversary of Portugal’s birth, this production - the first modern revival since the work premiered on Boxing Day 1799 in Venice at the start of the Carnival - is timely. One of the most successful and prolific composers his country has ever produced, Portugal in his time enjoyed royal patronage, international fame and was the toast of Venice.In taking up The Marriage of Figaro in the form of a two-act opera buffa, rather than the more customary four-act form, he was responding to the Paisiello’s success with the Barber. His librettist, Gaetano Rossi, clearly knew Da Ponte’s version, but that hardly matters, since here we have a new translation by Bampton’s own Gilly French and Jeremy Gray. Would that one could have heard all the words clearly, especially from the women. This production was crying out for side titles.The Beaumarchais story remains the same, as does the structure and the main characters. As for the music, spiritedly played in keeping with the feel of the piece by the Northern Chamber Orchestra, the Festival’s resident band, under conductor Robin Newton, Portugal amply demonstrates his ability to please. This is orchestration of real quality and melody, and he provides a steady stream of pleasing arias and duets. He makes exceptional demands on the principals, especially Susanna. Happily, Emily Rowley-Jones (pictured right) meets them in style, with fearless coloratura. Her duet with Lisa Wilson (Countess Almaviva) in Act two is a highlight. The singing generally is of a high standard. Nicholas Merryweather’s Figaro is strong and believable – and he sets an example in making every word clearly audible. Lyric tenor John-Colyn Gyeantey works hard as Count Almaviva and Joanna Seara is a sweet-voiced and perky Cherubino.If only the standard of acting could match the singing, but it is generally self-conscious and awkward. The staging doesn’t help. Jeremy Gray is responsible for the direction and the design, both of which are lacklustre. He hits the wrong note right from the start, having characters scurrying about aimlessly during the overture. Overtures are meant to be listened to without distraction. As we first meet Figaro and Susanna, preparing for their wedding, we see a large cardboard box stamped Ikea Sevilla  - and Figaro starts to empty it and fiddle with bits of wood on the floor. That sets the tone – a cheap laugh.The costumes, designed by Fiona Hodges, look as though they’ve been plucked at random from a children’s playbox. Count Almaviva looks as if he’s just stepped out of the Arabian Nights, wearing a turban with a feather in it. Figaro looks Roman in toga and sandals. The leading women wear big frocks. And so on. The overall movement is awkward and ungainly, with the singers often being left standing in a line. And there’s a rather basic, half-hearted ensemble dance thrown in. It really is just a mish-mash.I am glad to have had the opportunity to discover Portugal the composer. It proves that there are treasures on the shelves, which are worth dusting off. One can’t help but wonder why this “other” Figaro went into obscurity after just seven performances, even though it was following behind Mozart.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/marriage-figaro-buxton-festival,
597,"Eugene Onegin, Holland Park Opera",Eugene Onegin,Holland Park Opera,2012-07-14,David Benedict,"There are no two ways about this: Eugene Onegin is a masterpiece. The plotting is so thrillingly concise, the cunningly built-up musical passion so astonishingly detailed that there simply is no excuse for an underpowered or melodramatic production. But for the last 20 years, the Royal Opera and English National Opera have offered up one flawed – I’m being kind - production after another. Enter director Daniel Slater. His thrillingly intelligent Opera Holland Park production trounces them all.From the moment the overture begins it’s clear there’s a controlling intelligence at work. To Tchaikovsky’s repeatedly descending, minor-key strings, two figures in formal black silently stare at and stalk one other across the enormous width of Leslie Travers’ set, a snow-encrusted, splayed-out ruin of a formerly grand room.This is not just a framing-device designed to flatter a directorial conceit. Setting up the opera as existing in Onegin’s memory immediately underlines the ache of Tchaikovsky’s score as much as it enhances the traumatic regret of Pushkin’s story of failed love. But in harmony with his entire creative team, Slater’s approach also fires up the drama, not least in the transitions which instead of being merely reflective now become wholly energised.Indeed, animation is key to the approach. The expressionist set relieves everyone of the burden of naturalism (which almost never works for opera) but it’s a risky choice. A white set exposes the performers’ every gesture but Slater’s singers are more than up to the challenge. Indeed, although both Mark Stone as Onegin and Anna Leese as Tatiana are not ideally cast – the former’s voice is a little too light, the latter is not consistently rich enough – their performances are so convincing that only voice snobs will worry.Slater and his choreographer Denni Sayers make the singing-acting unusually dynamic. No one falls prey to the standard operatic (bad) habit of, say, striding downstage as directed exhibiting generalised emotions. Every shift in sung thought feels motivated and ideally placed. These performers play properly calibrated developing thoughts rather than “my character is gloomy/anguished/enraged” emoting.We’re told that Onegin is a man ostentatiously bored by provincial life which leads many down a dramatic blind alley. Make him a snob or near psychotic loner and his tragedy becomes an overly drawn-out foregone conclusion. But when not allowing us to see the pain of his memories as revealed in the transitions, Stone presents Onegin as smiling and self-confident. Not only does this make far more sense of his character’s appeal to Tatiana and, indeed, everyone else, it makes him far more interesting to watch and hear.Leese’s Tatiana is similarly re-thought, not least in contrast to Hannah Pedley’s Olga. Vocally, the latter is intriguingly cool-toned which comes in fascinating contrast to her outward coquettishness. It’s always been a puzzle as to why Olga is perfecty happy to be flirted with by Onegin at the party. Is she merely a fool? In Slater’s interpretation there’s a reason why there is no convincing love duet between her and Lensky: she’s actually not very interested in him after all, as revealed in a tiny masterstroke it would be unfair to give away. As Olga’s lover Lensky, Peter Auty has a slightly old-fashioned tenor sound, produced from quite far back in the voice. But the bigger the sound grows, the more powerfully expressive Auty becomes. With his engine of a voice fully unleashed, Lensky’s seething jealousy towards Onegin makes ever-increasing sense. The rethinking of the roles around Tatiana releases Leese (pictured left with Mark Stone) from playing her as merely naive. Leese uses a brooding sound and presence to make her more thoughtful – not for nothing does Tchaikovsky underline the fact that she is forever reading novels. This in turn gives weight to her love and its wreckage after she sends the fatal letter, and fires up the climax which she plays and sings with such dignity that when Onegin reaches out to her to – finally - touch her, you feel the audience flinch.Furthermore, in something of a directorial coup, Tatiana’s seeming understanding of her plight is given still more emotional weight as the opera is revealed to be not just Onegin’s purgatorial memory. Ahead of the second act party that follows Onegin’s rejection, Slater brings on a chorus of young women, all identically dressed and brandishing copies of Tatiana’s letter, who taunt and haunt Onegin. But in the scene that follows, it’s suddenly clear that this is Tatiana’s nightmare too. The dance is staged as a constantly repeated round of blind-man’s buff. Every time the blindfold is whipped away, Tatiana is confronted by her nemesis Onegin. Even Triquet, a character usually existing solely as light relief is cunningly pressed into service. Patrick Mundy presents him as a man so wrapped up in demons of his own that when launching into the second verse of his little song, he barges in front of Tatiana who was heading straight towards a showdown with Onegin.That kind of expressive detail is typical of a wholeseale rethink which even updates the action to impressive effect. Ballet-fans will be disappointed by the removal of the Polonaise dancers at the top of the third act. Fans of music-drama, however, will be engrossed by that scene's justification of the time-shift. We’re now in the Soviet era and the chorus are party workers taking charge and replacing the home's grandeur with a shrine to Lenin. Satisfyingly, this feels entirely organic rather than imposed. Slater has already set this up beautifully having turned the first act peasants’ merrymaking into a sharply effective scene of workers’ anger.Holland Park is, let’s face it, not the ideal acoustic for the paradoxically honeyed violin sound the score begs for, and under Alexander Polianichko’s occasionally sluggish conducting there are a few intonation problems in the strings. But such infelicities vanish beneath a production which understands and delivers the beating heart of Tchaikovksy’s triumph.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/eugene-onegin-holland-park-opera,
598,"Otello, Royal Opera House",Otello,Royal Opera House,2012-07-13,David Nice,"Pardon the anomaly of a lightly browned-up Latvian Moor married to a German-Greek beauty. This, after all, is not Shakespeare’s play but Verdi’s opera, for which all too few are born to sing heroic tenor Otello and lyric-dramatic soprano Desdemona. Great singing from Aleksandrs Antonenko and great everything from Anja Harteros vindicate Royal Opera music director Antonio Pappano’s decision to give Elijah Moshinsky’s 25-year-old production a proud place in the World Shakespeare Festival and to mix finesse with power in realizing every facet of this astonishing score.The framework still holds it all together thanks more to designer Timothy O’Brien’s well wearing columned Cyprus, handsomely allied to Renaissance Venice, than to much of what happens within it. The gulf between a hard-working movement group and the block semaphoring of the chorus, free at least to chart the progress of the opening storm without any vocal smudges towards a terrific climax, feels very 1980s.Antonenko’s Otello (pictured right, with Lucio Gallo’s Iago) is gestural but dignified, perhaps a little too much so as jealousy racks his pride – though as he falls to his knees to swear vengeance on his wife’s supposed betrayal, music and drama certainly become one. As they do in his rock-bottom Act Three soliloquy and the anguished cries of ""Desdemona"" after the murder: Domingo, after all these years still the Royal Opera’s benchmark Otello, would surely doff his cap to those. And the security of Antonenko's beaten-bronze tenor is never in doubt.Proof that it’s possible to have both the voice and the physical ease is incarnated in Harteros’s lovely lady. Her intentions are clearly etched in the early stages of an ineffable love duet: enfolding Otello with natural tenderness, soon to have him enfold her, and phrasing with incandescent distinctiveness; her responsive “Amen” is a moment to savour, and Pappano supportively does just that. The Act Two Quartet showcases a soprano of flawless assurance from well-projected chest voice to seraphic heights, and the big indignant blazes against Antonenko’s well-inflected ironies have her powerfully pulling out Verdi’s bigger stops - a warrior to match her consort, if only it weren't for his tragic flaw. She has the careful measure, too, of the anguish barely contained by the plangency of the Willow Song. It’s a mark of her believable goodness that you hope this Otello might change his mind about the killing.So much for the tragedy. The villainy is rather less convincingly mastered by Lucio Gallo’s Iago. You feel the powerful evil inflected chameleon-like by Pappano’s orchestra for his Credo is bigger than the baritone who senses it around rather than within him, and who tensely strains to match his master down in the pit. Gallo is better at the quiet intensity in ""beware, my lord of jealousy"" and in his nasty insinuation of Cassio’s talking in his sleep; there’s just enough here to send this Otello hurtling towards the abyss.Otherwise, the confidence of this revival is reflected in the smaller roles, including a far from lightweight Cassio, Antonio Poli, who relishes his brief moment in the sun, and Brindley Sherratt as a stalwart Venetian ambassador. Pappano makes sure there’s no question of instrumental pallor even in the usually throwaway moments of narrative business, and his orchestra brings down the tragic curtain with chords of the utmost gravity. What golden times these are for Verdi at Covent Garden – and the Shakespearean breadth of the composer’s imagination continues in anniversary year, when the conductor and Harteros are to be re-united in Don Carlo.

599,"The Maiden in the Tower & Kashchei the Immortal, Buxton Festival",The Maiden in the Tower & Kashchei the Immortal,Buxton Festival,2012-07-10,philip Radcliffe,"Many years ago in Helsinki I met Sibelius’s daughter, Margareta, and her husband, the conductor Jussi Jalas. He used to come to Manchester to conduct the Halle. And it was he who rescued from obscurity his father-in-law’s only completed opera, The Maiden in the Tower, composed in 1896. This he did in 1981 on Finnish radio, not long before he died. I can’t help thinking how thrilled he would have been to know that the work was at last receiving its UK premiere at the Buxton Festival.It is linked in a unique double bill with another neglected one-act opera, Rimsky-Korsakov’s Kashchkei the Immortal, written in 1902. That only had to wait 92 years for its UK premiere. We really are unearthing musical history here. Producer Stephen Lawless adventurously forges an unlikely continuum between the two, using the same cast and set, cleverly conceived by designer Russell Craig and lighting master John Bishop. And they both end happily in springtime. The staging is imaginative throughout, with some telling effects. The coupling is reasonable enough, since both concern desirable maidens being locked in towers by lustful lords. They get rescued, of course, by their heroic lovers. But the link is tenuous and the operas very different.Sibelius wrote his 35-minute opera for a charity event, conducted the first performance himself, then refused its publication. It features the maiden, a villain of a bailiff’s son, the lover and a good-fairy governess. The music is melodious and colourful, easy on the ear, especially when it comes to spring. The libretto, by Rafael Herzberg, is mundane and the plot thin.Lawless turns it into a children’s birthday party for the bailiff’s son, who appears like a petulant Billy Bunter in tweeds. He locks the maiden, here a young girl, in a castellated doll’s house, standing on one corner of an extra-tall, angled set with outsize cupboards and clock, suitable for Alice in Wonderland. On its own this seems incongruous. After all, the original story concerns adult abuse and love. But here the lover appears as a boy in a sailor suit with a model yacht. Maiden’s touching song of prayer after she has been ravished in the tower in the original, but here shamed in the little house by Billy Bunter, doesn’t sound right. Neither does the love song between her and Lover. But any incongruity must be suspended, since this is not now a stand-alone opera.   “Many years later” in this link-up comes the Rimsky. Those children are now grown up into a much darker world. The Princess (Maiden) is caged by evil magician Kashchei (Bailiff’s son), who has a sorceress daughter (Governess). The Princess’s suitor, Ivan (Lover) searches for her and they are reunited, but this time with the help of Nature in the form of Storm Wind. Musically, it is moody, dramatic and contrapuntal, with each character given their own theme. You could imagine it being written as a movie score for Hitchcock or some gothic horror. Conductor Stuart Stratford, with the Northern Chamber Orchestra, handles the score with great attention to detail and dramatic effect.Lawless has assembled an outstanding cast in terms of singing and characterisation. The Australian soprano Kate Ladner (Maiden/Princess) (pictured above left) has a glorious voice. Richard Berkeley-Steele (Lover/Kashchkei) (pictured above right), Owen Gilhooly (Bailiff’s son/Ivan) and Emma Selway (Governess/ Kashchei’s Daughter) manage their contrasting roles assuredly. And Robert Poulton makes an impressive Storm Wind.This double bill is a marriage made in Lawless heaven – daring, vivid, unexpected. He tests a concept and pulls it off. This, the last of this year’s three original Festival productions, is undoubtedly the showpiece.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/maiden-tower-kashchei-immortal-buxton-festival,4
600,"Jephtha, Buxton Festival",Jephtha,Buxton Festival,2012-07-09,philip Radcliffe,"Handel, a national hero at the time, went blind writing Jephtha, his last great oratorio, and sadly thence into terminal decline. Now, 260 years after its first performance at Covent Garden, we have a new production by Frederic Wake-Walker, who is also responsible for the design. So, it’s very much his show.Being an oratorio, Jephtha wasn’t written to be staged. So, what do you do? After all, the story is about a man with ambition whose success on the battlefield brings him national acclaim but personal tragedy. You could go traditional or modern. Or make him a character recognisable in today’s warring world.On this showing, Wake-Walker belongs to the hands-off, non-interventionist school of directing. You can see his argument – let the music speak for itself. But in that case why not perform the oratorio rather than place it in an opera festival? In the event, it is neither one thing nor the other, which could be the point he’s trying to make. Essentially, there are no costumes, no scenery except for five ordinary tubular chairs and a music stand, a blacked-out stage open to the back wall of black brick, old pipes and radiator included. The five principals wear everyday black clothes and the 16-strong chorus are dressed like pierrots in black with neck ruffs and stockings over their heads.He starts the performance with the house lights up for half an hour. The principals return to that oratorio mode at the end, two-and-a-half hours later, even being presented with faux bouquets and taking a bow. In between, the story unfolds.Jephtha, bastard offspring of a prostitute, leads the Israelites into battle against the Ammonites and vows to God that if he is victorious he will sacrifice the first living thing he meets on his return. The good news is that he wins, but the bad news is that the first creature he meets is his only daughter, Iphis, a beautiful virgin. In the oratorio, as distinct from the Old Testament account, the reverend librettist Dr Thomas Morell has an angel stay Jephtha’s murderous hand at the last minute. His daughter’s death sentence is commuted; instead she must give her life to God by spending it as a virgin in a nunnery.In the title role, James Gilchrist sings expressively and passionately, without being given the opportunity to act out the part, get into character or interact with the other principals, although he does briefly agonise over his daughter as she puts her head on the music stand. All the principals sing well. Gillian Keith (pictured right) makes a pert and touching Iphis, symbolically appearing in a red coat in this black world and singing of light as she unknowingly faces death, and she is well supported by counter-tenor William Purefoy as her sad fiancé. It would have been good to hear more of the excellent Susan Bickley as Jephtha’s wife, while Jonathan Best sings powerfully as Zebul. In the cameo role of Angel, Elizabeth Karani is one to watch.Harry Christophers, conducting the Orchestra of the Sixteen, sweeps Handel's score along spiritedly. The hand-picked 16-strong Festival Chorus has impressive force and quality. Their first appearance in a spot-lit line at the back of the stage comes as a spooky surprise. As time goes on they are given quite a lot of walking to do, up and downstage, like waves of soldiers, and they wrestle with the five chairs.They also do quite a bit of hand choreography, white on black, which is effective in its way. So, there is some “production”. And their entrance, one by one, near the end, on their knees pushing night lights along the ground to accompany the bleak chorus “How dark, O Lord” is most effective. Lighting designer John Bishop’s contribution to the staging is immense, throwing spots and shafts of light atmospherically into the gloom. Of course, the oratorio has a real depth, but however powerfully affecting, this production could use some costumed characters and stage action.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/jephtha-buxton-festival,3
601,"Intermezzo, Buxton Festival",Intermezzo,Buxton Festival,2012-07-08,philip Radcliffe,"No sooner had the Olympic torch been run out of town than in rushed the cavalcade of opera singers, musicians, actors, dancers and literary talkers for the start of the 34th Buxton Festival. Leading them, so to speak, was Stephen Barlow, the new Artistic Director. Nothing daunted, he decided to take up the baton for the opening night.The tradition here is to surprise us with works from opera’s old curiosity shop. Even if we’ve heard of them, we may well not have seen them, sometimes prompting the ironical “I wonder why?” Not the case with Intermezzo, but we have the double bill of Sibelius’s The Maiden in the Tower and Rimsky-Korsakov’s Kashchei the Immortal lying in wait.Starting with Intermezzo, Strauss’s autobiographical comedy-with-feeling, neglected for years after its Dresden premiere in 1924 and still not favoured with a London production, has a novelty value certainly. Delightful, tuneful and (melo)dramatic in its re-telling of the temporary domestic dissonance between man and wife, Richard and Pauline, and their happy reconciliation, it got proceedings off to a thoroughly enjoyable start. It was also a finely judged choice for this small glittering Edwardian opera house in the Derbyshire hills, embracing the intimacy of the piece.Set in Austria in 1902, in the mountain resort of Grundlsee and in Vienna, we see the story played out cinematically in 13 scenes linked by symphonic interludes. After each scene the curtain comes down, like a screen image fading to black, and the wonderfully descriptive mood music comes into its own.The domestic situation is temporarily disrupted by Robert Storch (Strauss) going off on a two-month conducting assignment, leaving his sharp-tongued wife Christine (Pauline) to her own devices. She soon meets a young admirer, Baron Lummer, on the slopes and develops a dalliance. All goes well until she opens a letter from a femme fatale to her husband, implying that he’s misbehaving while on tour. The impetuous Christine starts divorce proceedings at once, but is soon assured that the letter was intended for Robert’s colleague Stroh (easily confused with Storch?). The upset is sorted out and the couple resume their marital bliss (rather than blitz). It would be a trivial, if touching, tale, were it not a representation of a significant episode in the Strauss household. It’s really a love story in the end – and Christine, for all her bitchiness and self-pity, is really a pussycat.Conducting the Northern Chamber Orchestra, Barlow revelled in the interludes, drawing out those tell-tale Strauss melodies, which reaffirm the storyline. The libretto, written by Strauss himself and sung in English with side titles, reflects the domestic nature of the conversations, delivered in recitative form. That’s what it is – a plain and simple conversation piece and you need to pay attention to the words, some sung, some spoken, to share the humour, the feelings and the irony.At the centre of it all is Christine, who is hardly off the stage. Janis Kelly is just terrific in the part – querulous, self-serving, bitchy, coquettish, loving. Hers is an all-embracing characterisation and she sings with great clarity. The show is worth seeing for her alone, although she leads a fine cast. Stephen Gadd is a patient husband and Andrew Kennedy makes a nicely duplicitous Lummer (though he looks a tad too mature to be a toy boy). Susanne Holmes as Anna (pictured below, to the right, with Kelly), the no-nonsense maid who puts up with Christine’s sharp tongue, pleases the eye – and the ear.Director Stephen Unwin keeps the “play” workmanlike and practical, as befits the “ordinary” life portrayed. The staging is minimalist - essentially just a few sticks of furniture on a bare stage. At least this facilitates the swift scene changes, from domestic dining room to tobogganing to a Viennese ball and the rest. The downside is that this gets a little repetitive and there is no atmosphere. But, in the end, the atmosphere comes from the music, made to accompany a silent movie. Richard Strauss, the man and the composer, carries the day.This performance was dedicated to the memory of Malcolm Fraser, the young man who had the unlikely idea and imagination to start the Festival in 1979, who died earlier this year. MORE RICHARD STRAUSS ON THEARTSDESKDer Rosenkavalier, Royal Opera (2009).

602,"Le nozze di Figaro, Glyndebourne Festival Opera",Le nozze di Figaro,Glyndebourne Festival Opera,2012-06-30,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"It's amazing how long it takes to realise that we're in the 1970s in Michael Grandage's new Glyndebourne production of Le nozze di Figaro. The mansion house suggests that we're in the 18th century. The light and latticework says we're in Mozart's original Seville. The poor villagers that scurry about during the overture preparing the stage for visitors could be from pretty much anywhere Mediterranean and from any century. It's only when the Count rolls up in a 70s sports car, wearing a concorde collar and flares, that it really dawns on us that we are in the decade of free love.Traditionalists might gulp at all this. They will wonder how class conflict will survive. Can the Count's aristocratic privilege - his feudal right to bed his servant Susanna, his waiving of which is crucial to the plot - make sense in a 20th century context? In a way, of course, it can't. Yet the fact that the detail doesn't completely jar is fascinating. It reminds us that social liberation hadn't completed its course during this decade. The head of a house did still have a right to his staff in the 1970s, an unofficial one that was administered with a nudge and a wink rather than a command.The rest of the dysfunctional relationships thrive in a Seventies context. This was the decade that virtually invented the unhappy suburban marriage. And here we have the archetypal comfy middle aged couple, the Count and Countess, on a recuperative holiday break, engaging in the sexual shenanigans that the philosophy of their age encouraged but finding no liberation in any of it, dissatisfied with their lives, on the verge of divorce. The only aspect of Mozart's opera that is lost is the class-driven edge to the relationship between the Count and Figaro. Detached from its context, this battle of wits becomes a private squabble rather than a symbol of a wider social conflict. But the problem here lay as much in Vito Priante's under characterised Figaro as in Grandage's overall concept. What Priante lost in character, however, he gained in vocal control. Audun Iverson's Count had the opposite problem. Here, the characterisation was vivid and the vocal line vague.The girls were much better at marrying vocal control with stage presence. Lydia Teuscher's Susanna was fantastically alert, her voice full of a flickering energy. Isabel Leonard's Cherubino was spry, jerky, flirtatious and seductive - everything you'd want from a Cherubino (pictured below with Teuscher). Ann Murray's Marcellina was brilliantly shrill, Sarah Shafer's Barbarina pretty. Though the absence of a sotto voce denied Sally Matthews' Countess the potency that the character should have, her subtlety on stage, the way she captured the feeling of being adrift in this semi-liberated new world, was captivating. With any update to the 1970s, there is always the opportunity - and temptation - to milk the sitcoms that, inevitably, these 18th and 19th century opera buffa resemble. Grandage's refused to over-emphasise this, though it was impossible to avoid the echoes, especially in Alan Oke's perfectly pitched Don Basilio. Rejecting comic hyperbole meant that Grandage could focus on realism and truth, though it also meant that certain farcical elements fell a little flat. Had he dropped the high-mindedness for a moment and chiselled the Act Two bedroom farce according to the cruder rules of TV comedy the climax would have made more impact.Luckily we had Robin Ticciati in the pit, who, though he proceeded at a moderate paced, kept a thread going through the bedroom and garden scenes when the energy on stage began to flag. There was real sophistication to Ticciati's interpretation. Using every textural possibility that the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment afforded him, he revelled in the musical detail, emphasising psychological nerviness by bringing out chromatic instabilities. Grandage's desire for naturalism, however, was great boon for the eyes. Opera productions set in the 1970s tend to provoke designers into providing clown costumes and whacky wallpaper in the name of irony. Not here. Christopher Oram's designs were sober, elegant and ravishing. The Moorish tiling and fan-backed chairs weren't there to make any sort of statement (except possibly to say ""buy me""). They were there to facilitate the reality that the characters found themselves in. But not making a statement on stage is the biggest statement you could make. Modest, modish, the set became one of the evening's chief attractions.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/le-nozze-di-figaro-glyndebourne-festival-opera,
603,"Dr Dee, English National Opera",Dr Dee,English National Opera,2012-06-29,alexandra Coghlan,"Riding the same wave of affectionate, riotously melancholic Englishness which carried Jez Butterworth’s Jerusalem to success, Damon Albarn’s Dr Dee is dark enough to delight even the most cynical of Jubilee naysayers, gorgeous enough in its national pageantry to crown the cultural celebrations of this landmark year.Originally seen at last year’s Manchester International Festival (a reliable promise of good things). the show has been reworked for its Coliseum staging, and if the result is little clearer in its hallucinatory narrative, its confusion remains as compelling, as black-magical as ever.The Elizabethan polymath Dr John Dee – alchemist, physicist, courtier and philosopher – is a figure as beloved of artists as conspiracy theorists, and in his latest incarnation here (in the rangy, restless form of Paul Hilton) we find another dream-vision of his troubled psyche.While the synopsis might divide the opera into discrete sections – “Knowledge”, “Power”, “Empire” – charting the rise and devastating fall of its hero, the action strays through the material with associative whimsy, chronological rationality drowned in a clamour of images and musical fragments. The loose-fitting dramatic form is held together almost entirely by Rufus Norris’s ingenious staging.There’s more than a touch of the physical creativity of Complicite here, as Norris marshals an ensemble of dancing, singing actors through multimedia tableaux that reinvent books as coiling, cascading spirals of pages that encircle and oppress Dee, produce a tender shadow-dance for the lovemaking of Dee and his wife, and offer a fantastical image of Elizabeth I suspended in mid-air, trailing golden skirts hanging like curtains to the floor. The doubts and darknesses that haunt Dee become ravens, rendered with jerky vividness by dancers and latterly (in the evening’s final coup de théâtre ) by three live birds, whose cackling arrival on the Coliseum stage from the balcony offers a bathetic eulogy to the great man.Paul Arditti’s sound design gives us a truly immersive, surround-sound experience, working evocatively with Lysander Ashton’s video projection. Bells peal from somewhere at the back of the dress circle, planets suddenly swarm and circle the gesturing Dee. Yet there are cracks in the vision, moments where we are still jolted awkwardly into consciousness. A parade of figures from British History fall backwards into air – a sequence that would be miraculous but for the audible thump of their landing. Transitions between sections feel cursory, musical joins not always coherent.Suspended above the action for much of the show is an eclectic band whose forces shape the sound-world of the piece – part Early Music, part World Music, all Albarn. Perching like some disaffected troubadour on the edge of the stage is Albarn himself, crooning out his delicate folk-inflected ballads. His lived-in, loved-in voice curls itself evocatively around text that is sadly all but inaudible – an ongoing problem through the evening.While the music itself is far from complex, borrowing much from the minimalism of Glass, it offers a surprisingly convincing bridge between Albarn’s songs and more conventional opera. Nothing here feels too contrived, too try-hard, and if the singers seem caught between the precise vowels and tidy phrase endings of opera and the casual ensembles of popular music, at least the confusion feels honest.Led by the rasping Hilton, the cast dispatch their unsettling material with conviction, not least countertenor Christopher Robson (pictured above left), whose gleeful madness as scryer Edward Kelley and covetous urgency as the Bishop find memorable musical expression.Great contemporary English operas are a rarity. Since the game-changer that was Peter Grimes we’ve had The Minotaur, The Tempest, possibly some of Maxwell-Davies’ works. Dr Dee won’t find a place among this number, it’s too slight, to uncertain musically. But what it will do hopefully is revivify the earnest and often painfully abstruse workings of the genre, offering an authentically English piece of pageantry that is as enjoyable as it is intelligent.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/dr-dee-english-national-opera,
604,"Katya Kabanova, Longborough Festival",Katya Kabanova,Longborough Festival,2012-06-27,stephen Walsh,"Janáček’s obsession with Russia has always intrigued me: something to do with a shared Slav ancestry traceable to peasant roots being crunched to pieces by the modern world. Gone are the rolling paragraphs and the vast, empty fields and sky. In Katya Kabanova everyone is hemmed in by ancient attitudes and superstitions, and the music, with its abrupt, laconic gestures, is a part of the prison. The work’s most characteristic phrase is Katya’s helpless, repeated “There’s something else I wanted to tell you,” and its typical moment Kudryash’s useless attempt to explain lightning conductors to the pious obscurantist Dikoy.At WNO recently, Katie Mitchell smartened all this up and updated it effectively if improbably by a century or so; but at Longborough, Richard Studer has gone right back to Ostrovsky at his most severe and stockaded, almost as if the whole of 19th-century Russia were a Siberian house of the dead. The Volga flows somewhere beyond a timber wharf and the Kabanovs’ house and garden are nothing but a plank wall or two, a table and a chair. There is no excess: no superfluous baggage, certainly no greenery, and not much light – nothing to soften the emotional incarceration that everyone suffers but only Katya seems to notice.It’s a style that suits the music down to the ground, and one that allows the singers to control the flow of the drama. It gives them space and context. Katya’s passion is a product of unhealthy dreams prompted by the aridity of her marriage and the psychological torture of her mother-in-law. The music zooms in on her like a spotlight, and everything hangs on her ability to hold our attention as she expounds her fantasies, her conflicting impulses and, in the end, her hellish guilt.Lee Bisset (pictured right with Michael Bracegirdle) takes touching advantage of this clarity and austerity of approach. Hers is not always the most ingratiating soprano;  it’s apt to spread under pressure at the top. But it’s a highly expressive instrument, intelligently used. She controls Katya’s violent changes of mood beautifully: downcast with her wretch of a husband, dignified with his evilly possessive mother, suddenly, disturbingly radiant in recounting her dreams to Varvara – the happy voice of temptation, urging her into the sin from which there is no exit. She’s also a clever actress who knows how to use facial and bodily expression to abet the music. This is a big asset in a small theatre with a dry acoustic that doesn’t always let the voice do all the work it would like to.Everyone else in the piece is really part of the frame: agents of Katya’s destruction or helpless observers. Peter van Hulle’s Kudryash is a reassuring figure with his simple, scientific view of life; but he’s a mere child in the presence of these dark passions, unlit by electricity. Interestingly, the rational man knows folksongs and sings them sweetly: light love, true to Varvara (Jane Harrington’s) easy-going view of such matters. In the end, all they can do is run off “to a new, jolly life”, an exit worthy of Houdini.Michael Bracegirdle’s Boris, too, presents the inadequacy that surrounds Katya with discreet precision. We know in the end that his love is thoughtless (he, too, leaves on the next train); yet his scenes with her are extremely moving, thanks in no small measure to Studer’s tactful, undemonstrative stage management. Studer’s one mistake, I think, is to make such a wimp of Tikhon Kabanov; weak he must be, of course, but there has to be something in him that Katya might once have fallen for. Christopher Lemmings’ grovelling wreck has no past of that kind, though as far as it goes he sings the part well enough. His mother is the usual venomous Gauleiter, played and sung with relish but rather one-dimensionally by Louise Winter. Perhaps Janáček doesn’t offer much more.Jonathan Lyness conducts an intense, carefully paced performance. The playing, a shade scrappy at first, soon settles down. But Tony Burke’s skilfully reduced score (double instead of triple woodwind, two horns down from four, and so on) seems to make blend trickier, while probably easing matters for the singers, who have to fight Janáček’s orchestra less than usual. Sensibly, though the performance is in English, we get surtitles (and, if you’re forward or to the side, a crick in your neck). A quick read of the compact libretto before curtain-up is probably the answer.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/katya-kabanova-longborough-festival,
605,"Les Troyens, Royal Opera",Les Troyens,Royal Opera,2012-06-26,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"Les Troyens is one of music's mythical beasts. The greatest opera that few will have ever seen. Until recently the epic was considered so demanding that it was thought unstageable. David McVicar's new production for the Royal Opera House is only the second in its history. So for most of us last night will have been the first chance to witness the five-hour masterpiece in its original French. Beyond the fact that the cast is huge, however, (the opera house were fielding the largest number of extras ever), there is little about the story that makes the work anything but a joy to follow. Focusing tidily on the sack of Troy in Part One (Acts One and Two), Aeneas's flight to and alliance with Dido's Carthage in Acts Three and Four and the split between Aeneas and Dido in Five, Berlioz's libretto is exemplary. Never is one force-fed. Never is one allowed to get lost. The emotional see-sawing over the ideas of love and loss, duty and honour, is given space to rise and fall naturally. And unlike the work that it helped to give birth to, Wagner's Ring Cycle, in Troyens there is an accommodation with simplicity that allows for moments of extraordinary reflective mystery as well as between-the-eye impact.With these musical and theatrical basics, all McVicar had to do was not mess up. And he didn't. McVicar is a safe pair of hands. His dependably flat-pack ideas came up trumps yet again. We began in familiar McVicar territory, in a 19th century industrial dystopia, Troy as a metallic barrel, claustrophobic, towering, surrounding by the litter of war that will form the Trojan horse. Aeneas flees to Carthage in Part Two and we land in a halcyon North Africa of sunny ziggurats (pictured below right). Blocking and choreography was suitably clear, conservative and theatrical. Think Raymond Gubbay, Matthew Bourne, ITV2: solid, populist, superficial and camp.It made no concessions to the adventurousness in the pit, but it also never once impeded it. Taking Aeneas's lead, Berlioz's score journeys across the whole known musical world. Exotic melodies and harmonies are visited, sometimes merely in fleeting daydreams. Extraordinary rhythms and texture are sourced. Structure is played with throughout. The result is a feverish variety that mirrors the physical and emotional turmoil on stage. Even the simple aria of a homesick Trojan sailor, Hylas (exquisitely sung by Ed Lyons), becomes a thing of wonder in Berlioz's hands, with the vocal score hoist high up the register on flute rigging, overlooking cello breakers. Pappano judged every bar to perfection. As did the Royal Opera House Orchestra. It was a loving and unflappable depiction. The transition from a clarinet and horn-centred soundscape in the sack of Troy to a flute and string-focussed idyll in unfettered Carthage was handled with noticable care. It was underpinned by a glorious performance from the opera house chorus, who seemed to love every single plangent note. They weren't let down by the leads.Though Anna Caterina Antonacci's Cassandra was impossible to take seriously while waving her arms around like Kate Bush, she was at least on strikingly good vocal form. So were most of the others. Eva-Maria Westbroek's Dido, at first so careless with the beat and overly generous with her vibrato, recovered as she switched from Princess Diana-like Polly-Anna-ishness to delirium and madness. Brindley Sherratt's Narbal (Dido's minister) tightened up his voice too as the stakes were raised.Brian Hymel was nicely lean of voice and French of texture as Aeneas. He didn't quite generate the fire that might have come from Jonas Kaufman, who pulled out, but there was class in his performance nonetheless. The most musicality was to be found in the smaller roles, in Hanna Hip's exceptional Anna (Dido's sister) and Lyon's scene-stealing Hylas (pictured left), whose touching aria rang out while he swung from the rafters. This and the Fourth Act love scene, in which a toy plan of Carthage rises into the heavens to become a night sky were McVicar magic.The opera house probably thought that Troyens would be the perfect prep for next year's Wagner bicentenary. The Wagnerian connection is certainly strong. There are passages of tumescent headiness especially during the elopement of Dido and Aeneas in Act Three that appear to look to the opening of Die Walkure. But what's more interesting is the link to the tradition of the French tragedie-lyrique.It is by strictly following this old-fashioned form and the rules set down by Lully and Rameau that Berlioz was able to provide something of such freshness. The tragedie-lyrique informs all the most arresting passages of the opera: the epic choral lament in the First Act, the snakey duet of the Third and Hylas's tender homeward-bound air. It is here amid the murmuring woodwinds that the most memorable musical truth of Troyens is to be found and the genius of Berlioz can be most clearly observed. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/les-troyens-royal-opera,
606,"Billy Budd, English National Opera",Billy Budd,English National Opera,2012-06-19,ismene Brown,"It should be hard to make Britten’s Billy Budd a bloodless, passionless, contextless bore, shouldn’t it? This is after all a lacerating story about men behaving badly on a fighting ship in the 1797 wars between Britain and Revolutionary France, a story where a man of great viciousness meets a man of much havering and a decent, possibly extraordinary lad loses his life.And yet it’s what David Alden and English National Opera have achieved with this new production. Re-uniting the team who produced a hotly argued-about Peter Grimes in 2009, this has even more the sense of a disconnection between pit and stage, with an electric orchestral performance under Edward Gardner that’s negated again and again by a production that actually manages to make Billy Budd a bore.The one unmitigated good thing is the conductor, driving Britten's great score like a master and commander on his ship - indeed, like the Vere we should be seeing on stage. But the setting built by Paul Steinberg refutes any sense of forward motion or 18th-century history, channelling a different, over-familiar revolution with a blank Soviet-looking factory space furnished with two industrial walls that winch up and down, and no need for sea legs. The crew of the Indomitable are garbed like garage mechanics in grey overalls and caps, and Captain Vere is a tubby inaction man in a tinpot dictator's white suit, only some braid on the cuffs hinting at naval uniform. His office is a stark white planked tube, and the entire place is conventionally anonymous, empty, not just devoid of humanity, devoid of signs of human usage or purpose.Now, were this devised to summon up the claustrophobia of a submarine or a space-ship, I’d happily project my imagination into it, but its laziness, its arrogance, its lack of relish for the material, interferes. There is no suggestion of sea or momentum, no elemental instability or ephemeral morality, not even much obvious work for the men to do apart from haul a few very clean ropes. Why should we have to work harder to imagine the story’s setting than the designer and director have?Within this soulless place, it hardly seems likely that Billy Budd, the new pressganged recruit, would be allowed to flourish his curly, uncut locks without a cap, unlike all the other crew. Nor does it add anything helpful that clear stage directions in the libretto are often and obviously negated: Billy is told by another man to shush and not wake his mates - yet there’s nobody else there. The court martial agrees to “rise” when the officers are already striding about the room. Claggart insists on a beaten man crawling to him, but then himself wanders up to him so he doesn't need to move.The effect of silly contradictions like this is constantly to dissipate any invocation of the tight, menacing atmosphere of the Indomitable, the rough magic of being at sea, and the pressure-cooker war conditions that mould its characters and their common tragedy.Claggart, the master-at-arms, is vile because he has utter contempt for his life, and he hates anything that reminds him there are alternatives - hence his loathing of good, easy-going Billy Budd. Praise be for Matthew Rose, the pasty-faced nasty who was last night the saving grace of the leading roles, a big bullying closet gay who clutched Billy’s red neckerchief to his groin as he growled his confession to the night, “Handsomely done...” Rose is a perceptive actor with a richly expressive bass voice, and conveyed his malignant character (a Iago, if you like) with a still concentration in his body and sudden, arresting contortions of his mouth. The performance of the night.Frustratingly, no such interest in either Kim Begley’s Captain Vere or Benedict Nelson’s Billy. Begley replaced the originally intended Toby Spence (currently battling illness), and I wondered whether it was he or Alden who determined that Vere should come across as a minor civic dignitary rather than any kind of action hero. What on earth is there in this doughy, passive bureaucrat that makes men on a warship throw up their hats and cry “Starry Vere!” With such a narrow tenor timbre and a stolid lack of identification with what Vere actually says, Begley seemed to me at sea in a role that's wrong for him.Nelson too (pictured above) delivered a generic Billy without much edge, ordinary, pacific and impossible to dislike. The stutter wasn’t believable, from his reading, as a symptom of some unpredictable inner strain, and his lash at Claggart wouldn’t have felled a chicken. Surely Billy needs to be a young Adonis, or a Jesus Christ, or a Lennie Small - a person who helplessly attracts others’ resentment or desire. Between them, Begley and Nelson made little of the pivotal emotional stand-off where Vere shamefully sanctions Billy’s execution.Much of this gutlessness has to be put down to Alden’s static, slow-motion directing of a stageful of well-fed men few of whom act as if capable of strenuous physical exertion. Their symbolic dragging of ropes or bundles is awkwardly braked, with no weight in the movement; their slo-mo marching exposes that most of them have no idea why they’re doing it (the body cannot lie).Good work from Nicky Spence as the Novice (but again poor directing - so easy a recovery after his flogging?), Gwynne Howell’s resonant Dansker, and Jonathan Summers’ authoritative, upright Redburn. But how to understand what common cause Gardner and Alden agreed in this broken-backed and unrewarding production?",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/billy-budd-english-national-opera,2
607,"Bow Down, The Village Underground, Spitalfields Festival",Bow Down,The Village Underground,2012-06-14,alexandra Coghlan,"There’s a lovely moment in The Opera Group’s production of Bow Down. An actor motions to a member of the audience and grins bleakly: “He thought he was here for an opera….”.  It’s an aside, over before we’ve even fully registered it, but it’s one that reminds us that both Tony Harrison and Harrison Birtwistle knew exactly what they were doing when they constructed this amputated, bleeding limb of a work and christened it an “opera”, back in 1977.It would be hard to imagine two more brusque, pitilessly beautiful artists than Birtwistle and Harrison. From Lancashire and Yorkshire respectively, each cuts niceties back to the bone in the astringency of their work, raging fiercely and often inscrutably in a world of tame cultural apologists. There’s also a shared allegiance to art’s instinctive urge to storytelling, and it’s this that comes to the fore in their ballad opera-in-little-but-name Bow Down.The fruit of Birtwistle’s time at the National Theatre, Bow Down takes the grim little folk tale of the Two Sisters (two sisters, one lover, a murder and then a ritual execution) – a story whose evolutions takes in much of Europe as well as North America – and creates a theatrical collage. The many different narrative variants coexist and interact in a free-form piece that comes at truth by the side entrance.Characters move and are exchanged fluidly among the small cast, who most often speak in chorus, weighting Harrison’s eloquent couplets (only he of V could avoid twee here) with drums, tuned percussion and a partly improvised haze of flute, oboe and recorders.As the inaugural production for Frederic Wake-Walker as artistic director of The Opera Group it’s an uncompromising choice, partly for its improvised elements, but mostly because there’s so little actual singing involved. Whereas Birtwistle’s “dramatic pastoral” Down by the Greenwood Side marries its folk material to a recognisably contemporary score, here we have to trawl for music among the densely visual wreckage of legend and narrative, sharp with contradictions and dead ends.Wake-Walker’s young cast (named but uncredited on the cast list, owing to the free exchange of roles) help to emphasise the naïf quality of the work, with slicker episodes for dramatic ensemble intercut with oddly simplistic musical gestures. It’s a precarious structure that topples at the slightest imbalance, and occasional moments of faltering pace or energy do punctuate the show’s hour. These are balanced by the work of the male actors, whose revisionist, male iteration of the tale (complete with vividly enacted ejaculation joke, some casual necrophilia and plenty of vintage Harrison filth) offers a welcome moment of levity.Framed in the cavernous, unfinished space of Shoreditch’s Village Underground some of the finer textual details are lost, as are both much of Anna Jones’ minimal designs and Wake-Walker’s foreground dramatic gesture if you sit anywhere but the front rows. Perhaps guessing at the missing element, improvising mentally to fill in the gaps, is the final stage in the evolution of the legend, but it’s not ideal.“Find the beef, the beer, the bread, then look behind”, urges Harrison elsewhere in his poetry. It’s an injunction Bow Down takes to heart, examining the physical traces and everyday remnants of a story – fossilised into legend – and unpacking the cultural processes behind them. It’s clever, bold, and in 2012 now feeling just a little bit dated. Perhaps it’s the earnestness of performance, perhaps it’s the work’s rusting mechanisms themselves, but for all its brutality Bow Down offers an oddly bloodless experience.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/bow-down-village-underground-spitalfields-festival,
608,"Così Fan Tutte, Opera Holland Park",Così Fan Tutte,Opera Holland Park,2012-06-09,David Benedict,"With the obvious exceptions of Verdi’s twin masterpieces Otello and Falstaff, Così fan tutte is the most Shakespearean of operas. Centuries before anyone invented the term, it’s nothing less than opera’s most elegant study in sexual politics. Written with the textural richness and emotional reversals of Much Ado About Nothing, it needs acting/singing performances of true depth in order to succeed. Harry Fehr’s new production adds a framing device of conscious performance, but intriguing though this is, it distracts from true engagement with the heart of the work.Intent upon underlining the analytical nature of Mozart and Da Ponte’s experiment in love, he and designer Alex Eales set up a stage within a stage, a traditional, in-period, indoor/outdoor space in which the women are wooed. On either side of them on the wide Holland Park stage sit not only the period-dressed chorus but, when not in the action, the leading characters. As Nicholas Garrett’s stern Don Alfonso makes plain with a large glass bell jar, they are attending a quasi-scientific lecture, one in which female loyalty and male behaviour will be tested.It’s a smart idea but Fehr runs away with it, encouraging those watching to overdo the self-conscious “reacting”. When Fiordiligi almost falls for the disguised Ferrando, it causes near uproar in the onstage audience, with one of them jumping up and gesticulating wildly. Cogent though that is, typically, it pulls focus away from the main action. More problematically still, that degree of activity in the frame gives Dawid Kimberg and Andrew Staples’s Guglielmo and Ferrando more to play against, but reacting with those on stage comes at the expense of them playing to us. Meantime, back at the real plot, things are a shade underpowered, not helped by Thomas Kemp’s conducting. There are a few passages of shaky ensemble and, from the less-than-driven overture onwards, the undeniably civilised orchestral playing often lacks attack. That’s missing, too, in some of the playing. Given the convincing detail of the libretto (not a phrase one can use about many operas) it’s faintly depressing to watch standard-issue performances. To be fair to Joana Seara, there’s nothing actually wrong with her pertly sung Despina. But the amusingly aged and squeaky voice she adopts when disguised as the notary is the only surprise she delivers all night, as the rest of the time Fehr simply lets her do knowing “maid acting”.He also fails to solve “the Dorabella problem” for Julia Riley (pictured right with David Kimberg). Until she succumbs to Guglielmo, Dorabella is rather under-characterised and Riley is given little more to do than be alternately girlish and thoughtful.Dawid Kimberg grows convincingly angry as Guglielmo – it’s well-nigh impossible to stand out in the role – but he is saddled with the production’s insistence that the men’s disguises (especially the hair and daft moustaches) make them look and act daft. But if that’s the case, why do the women struggle but then fall for them? The plot device affords comedy opportunities aplenty but the action here is too generalised, and when you clock the fact that more laughs are elicted by the surtitles than the action, you realise something’s amiss. Elizabeth Llewellyn’s supremely dignified Fiordiligi is the night’s highlight. Like her voice – already a glowing, autumnal soprano but dropping tantalising hints of more expansive roles to come – Llewellyn (pictured below, centre) is going places. She, too, suffers from lack of imaginative direction in the first act, singing an assured “Come scoglio” that supplied everything that was required yet nothing unexpected. But in the harsher emotions of the second act, her entire performance blossoms. The arresting ache she finds in her wholly arresting “Per pietà” is balanced by the sincerity of Andrew Staples’ (pictured below, second from right) “Un’ aura amorosa”. His beautifully sustained pianissimo singing of the da capo section was as easeful as you could wish for. He began his career as a choral scholar but has escaped the constraint of the overly clean English tenor sound bred by the choral tradition. There’s also a promising Italianate ring to his voice that brings real excitement. Most productions showcase the emotional concerns and vocal opportunities of the wronged women. It’s fascinating and highly unusual to discover a production concentrating on the men and their manipulation. But by failing to explore and dramatise the effect on the women – the unhappy ending lacks dynamism and is of more interest to those on stage than the audience – Fehr’s overbalanced experiment grows sadly distancing.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/cosi-fan-tutte-opera-holland-park,
609,"Lucia di Lammermoor, Opera Holland Park",Lucia di Lammermoor,Opera Holland Park,2012-06-08,alexandra Coghlan,"Out-characterising anything on stage last night, London’s weather certainly did its bit to celebrate the start of the Opera Holland Park summer season. No Scottish heath could have been more blasted, no moorland more battered by the wind than we were in the shadow of “Lammermoor Castle” (aka Holland House) for the company’s Lucia di Lammermoor.The backdrop of Holland House – originally built in 1605, and determinedly crenelated and  decorated – gives Opera Holland Park’s auditorium its particular character; it’s an unwise director who chooses to ignore it altogether. Seasons past have proved that you can successfully work with this built-in backdrop (it became a surprisingly plausible Sevillian cigarette factory for Carmen) or kick against its classic Englishness (as Don Pasquale so effectively did last season), but there’s nothing neutral about it. Pretending it’s not there is simply not an option if it’s not to become the architectural elephant in the room.Unfortunately denial was the approach taken by director Olivia Fuchs last night, and her non-committal engagement with the space set the tone for a production that felt curiously unmoored and lacking in concept. Designer Jamie Vartan contributes a Neolithic slab of rock that dominates the stage. Opening up to reveal a giant fissure (symbolism only marginally less subtle than the red gloves sported by male and female chorus alike, and waved threateningly around during Act III) through which Holland House becomes visible. Add some wire-netting screens (a la West Side Story), faithfully Victorian costumes and a disproportionately prominent library-style staircase for Edgardo’s revenge aria, and you have enough to drive any self-respecting heroine mad.Which makes it all the more frustrating that Lucia di Lammermoor features one of the very strongest casts we’ve seen at Opera Holland Park. Elvira Fatykhova’s Lucia is beyond technical reproach, battling aeroplanes, children’s playground chants and the elements to deliver an impressive performance. Deploying her vocal colours with care, she balances turbo-powered money-notes at the top with glowing pianissimos, romping through the mad scene (and eerie cadenza duet with the glass harmonica) with ease. Only in this climactic episode did her pristine girlishness become an issue, failing either to release into ravings or to intensify into manic joy. If Fatykhova’s Lucia was something of a cipher, the same could not be said for David Stephenson’s Enrico, who led the cast dramatically with his charged restraint. While Aled Hall’s pantomime Arturo loaded the dice emotionally, Stephenson was allowed to inhabit an altogether more interesting No Man’s Land of character, pitting duty and self-interest against each other. Strongly sung, he was more than matched by Aldo Di Toro’s Edgardo (pictured below). Personable in manner, Di Toro’s tenor is also unusually attractive, blending the warmth of its lower registers all the way up through the voice to the resonant top. Nothing is too bright or too forward, and the contrast with the sheen on Fatykhova’s tone shows both voices to advantage in duet.Splitting horns across the pit from trombones and trumpets was a bold move, but a few moments of ensemble juddering aside, Stuart Stratford kept his band together – no small challenge in the tricky space. Without a sunken pit to cushion the sound however some entries were just too loud though, pushing the soloists’s dynamics (the excellent young chorus were more than a match for anything the orchestra could generate) rather than balancing down to them.Lucia’s balance of psychological Gothic horror and musical ebullience rather defies staging; it’s an opera that lives most fully in the suggestive vividness of the recording studio. Close your eyes and Opera Holland Park’s latest production punches well above its weight, delivering a clean and vivid account of Donizetti’s finest score. Open them however and this fragile tragedy gets bogged down in its attempts to be clever. In a piece that glories in sensation, emotion, immediacy, it’s a crime of lack-of-passion – as calculated as it is unforgiveable.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/lucia-di-lammermoor-opera-holland-park,
610,"La Bohème, Glyndebourne Festival Opera",La Bohème,Glyndebourne Festival Opera,2012-06-07,David Benedict,"It has romantic sweep but is held firm by zealous attention to detail and while it’s hugely expansive of gesture, it’s never generalised. I’m talking about Kirill Karabits’ conducting of La bohème at Glyndebourne. I wish I could say the same for the production.If David McVicar’s vision of love among the artists had punch on its first outing in 2000, something has been lost in the translation. Lest we forget that Rodolfo and his chums are unsuccessful, the contemporary setting is self-consciously drab – presumably to support Puccini’s exploration of verismo and off-set the passion of his music. The visual exception to the wearyingly earnest tone is the suitably gaudy, neon-style scene of bohemian life at Cafe Momus which closes with fire-eaters and flames rippling down the edges of an anodyne metal walkway. But in this incarnation the opera itself fails to catch fire or, indeed, to elicit tears.The biggest surprise of the opening night came at the curtain call where David Lomeli (Rodolfo) picked up Ekaterina Scherbachenko (his Mimi) and, to their evident delight, swung her around before taking their bows. Nothing wrong with that display of joy – they’re both making their Glyndebourne debuts – but that was the most relaxed, connected and spontaneous that the two of them had been all night.Technically, both of them put in clean vocal performances. Lomeli’s voice is not big – he cannot ride the orchestra at the climaxes – but there’s a shiny ring on his well-supported, bright tenor sound that nicely suggests the ardour of youth. And Scherbachenko (pictured below right) has an evenly produced and much stronger voice than her ideally gaunt figure would suggest. But is strength really the quality you dream of in Puccini’s consumptive heroine? More problematically still, for all the quality of their voices, for most of the evening it feels as if these two are singing at rather than with each other.It’s clear that they have paid close attention to revival director Lee Blakeley but the results are on the dutiful side. Their angst-filled looks and singing display the required emotions but you never feel involved because the dramatic impulse that should drive them is missing. Mimi admits to Marcello in the third act that Rodolfo, torn apart by jealousy, wants to throw her out. But it’s impossible to square that with Lomeli who is much given to standing around with his hands jammed into his jeans pockets.It’s unfortunate that his awkwardness is thrown into stark relief by the relaxed, powerful presence of Andrei Bondarenko as Marcello. It was clear at the 2011 Cardiff Singer of the World (he deservedly ran away with the Song Prize) that he is a wonderfully expressive singer with a thrillingly unforced sound. What you could only guess at in competition was that he can really act. Unlike Lomeli, Bondarenko never looks like he’s trying and that lack of strain makes him completely engaging. He never indulges in scene-stealing but it’s hard not to prefer watching him and listening to the sheer richness of his lush baritone sound, especially since he’s singing opposite the highly effective Musetta of Irina Iordachescu. Musettas tend to be overly bright and brittle, a notion unnecessarily underlined by her sparkly, figure-hugging, consciously tacky costume. But Iordachescu is much better than that. She has all the requisite coloratura and spirited flouncing for Puccini’s flirt, but with an intriguingly hooded sound. Up against Scherbachenko’s more unyielding tone, hers is more textured and considerably warmer.The lack of heat overall, however, is equally attributable to the design. Michael Vale’s set is indicative of a milieu – it’s centred around a severely run-down workshop/living space – but not only is the logic of the space confusing, the scale feels awkward. The small central set piece looks so marooned in its surrounding space that the atmosphere created by the singers is drained of energy. As a result, most of the night’s excitement comes from the pit.Karabits’ tempi are defiantly on the expansive side, but that’s partly because he is investigating the textures in order to make Puccini’s detailing audible. Opera snobs like little better than to write Puccini off as too vulgar, not least for his predilection for upholstering vocal melodies with plush string support. But Karabits recognises him as an enviable musical dramatist – contemporary composers/librettists listen and learn – whose orchestral writing seethes with purposeful use of colour. In the wintry third act, famously ushered in with minor-key flute and harp, Karabits spotlights the London Philharmonic Orchestra’s lead flautists and harpist. That highly evocative chill is typical of the exquisite, precise playing he coaxes from the players. It is, of course, right that you emerge from the opera singing Puccini’s praises. If only that were because of rather than in spite of the efficient but less than involving production.  ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-boh%C3%A8me-glyndebourne-festival-opera,
611,"Don Giovanni, Garsington Opera",Don Giovanni,Garsington Opera,2012-06-07,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"For all but two of its 30 years in business, Garsington Opera has had Mozart in each and every season. He's the nearest this company gets to a resident composer. While everything else at the seasonal operation is in flux, their Mozart is a constant. And as with any long-running relationship, there is a confidence in the coming together of the two of them that usually makes any new Mozart production at Garsington one of the Summer highlights. This year was no exception. We began the night, however, with a cliche. Like many a director before him, Daniel Slater chose to relocate the 18th-century lothario to an American Psycho-type context: Don Giovanni as a high-flying solipsist, Leporello as his chauffeur. But cliche doesn't accompany deja vu. For this very familiar updating is sculpted in the most unusual and brilliant way. Grant Doyle's property developer Don Giovanni is in control - of the women, the men, the music and the mains. The night opens with him flicking on the lights to this swanky block of minimalist apartments. In one flat, the aspirational chavs: gum-chewing Zerlina and lycra-clad Masetto, ready for their big fat gypsy wedding. In another, the city boy, Ottavio, a Giovanni wannabe, and Anna, whose twisted sexual habits sets off this cascade of rape and murder. In another minimal box, Sophie Bevan's Elvira, a snivelling wreck, but ready to return to her brute at the drop of a hat.Innocence is no where to be found. Good and bad are intermingled. Mozart's score (given a bracing outing by Douglas Boyd and the Garsington Opera Orchestra) does the same; it makes no judgements. In fact, it skewers you with counter-intuitive messages. Just as you think you've got the measure of a character, it confounds you: Zerlina the low-grade tart becomes Zerlina the paragon of love and forgiveness. Slater makes the most of these psychological complexities and finds 21st century homes for all of them.Not a single scene, sentiment or word (the libretto translation had been neatly tweaked) was stranded in the 18th century. Everything had been thought of, thought through and brought into the the present day. The lover's list became a spread sheet on a computer print out. The musical quotations become opera DVDs that Giovanni flicks through over dinner. Finicky updatings of this kind can come across as contrived. But Slater's analogies are too clever and too well choreographed. Most clever and well choreographed was Giovanni's descent into hell. Slater brings a brilliantly rational sense to bear on this supernatural ending. Don Giovanni's penalty for a life of greed and obsession is a living death, sedated and wheelchair-bound, the white walls of his swish, sinful world morphing into the white walls of a mental institution.There was a vocal and theatrical strength in the cast that made Slater's job easier. Grant Doyle (pictured with Mary and Sophie Bevan right) and his aggressively floppy hair were made to play Mozart's semi-seductive baddies. As with his Figaro a few years back, his Giovanni was laced with a compelling menace throughout, a rendition that had just enough charm that you could understand why Elvira would return to him. Casting the piercing and powerful voice of Natasha Jouhl as the twisted, S&M-loving feminist Anna was a stroke of genius. She deserved a medal for her sotto voce in ""Non mi dir"", delivered half-naked and in the freezing cold. Callum Thorpe was a strong Masetto and Mary Bevan a characterful Zerlina. Joshua Bloom's Leporello was excellently slimy. Accompanied by the fantastic young Garsington chorus, Christophoros Stamboglis's dying but not quite dead Commendatore, a Harvey Weinstein figure, re-emerged from his hospital bed in the final scene and electrified the evening. Only Jesús León's casual Ottavio disappointed. But the night belonged to Sophie Bevan's Elvira. Unlike most great operatic actresses who develop their stage presence to compensate for vocal failings, Bevan really can sing. She starts with a meaty and technically assured vocal sound and uses it to paint extraordinary psychological portraits. The journey her rendition of ""Mi tradi quell'alma ingrata"" (""That ungrateful wretch betrayed me"") took from shouty anger to exhausted self-pity was a thing of bitter wonder. In one final clever move, Slater gives Ottavio a central role in Giovanni's downfall. One that leaves Ottavio free to take over his empire. It will soon be another poor girl's turn to sing Elvira's song. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/don-giovanni-garsington-opera,
612,"L'Olimpiade, Garsington Opera",L'Olimpiade,Garsington Opera,2012-06-04,alexandra Coghlan,"Despite ever-more determined attempts by musicologists to broaden the baroque repertoire of our opera houses, Handel still very much has things his own way. But in this Olympic year a sly challenge has emerged from Antonio Vivaldi’s L’Olimpiade – its topical, Games-themed premise garnering it more performances in a single year than in the past 200 put together. Undeniably apt, unquestionably novel, but is the opera actually any good?Garsington Opera clearly believe so. For them, L’Olimpiade is no stand-alone rarity, but rather the celebratory culmination of a three-year Vivaldi project. Following on from L’Incoronazione de Dario and last year’s La Verità in Cimento, L’Olimpiade offers the final piece of evidence in their case for the rehabilitation of the composer’s operatic reputation.Dario – superbly cast – helped keep minds open, while La Verità charmed in David Freeman’s stylish production, but in L’Olimpiade I’m afraid the defence begins to look a little shaky.This is no reflection on the performers; the opera’s young cast are almost universally strong, but so much so that it makes you wish they’d not been handed such a dud of a score. There are a couple of stand-out arias (in three hours of music even Vivaldi had to stumble upon gold every now and then) and structurally it’s all rather interesting, with static recit-aria opening scenes giving way to a much more fluid arioso-based drama as tensions heighten, but there’s no getting away from the fact that all the composer’s best music is found in the pit rather than on the stage. Nor that, even at his best, he’s nowhere near the melodist that Handel is.In the gorgeous, frozen world of La Verità Freeman set the bar high, and his lycra-clad, Nike-sporting athletes and David Roger’s rather half-hearted designs can’t quite match up. The plot is convoluted and bathetic enough (there’s a classic of a long-lost-son reveal) and the score sufficiently flimsy without further undercutting it with ugly visuals; what hero could truly sustain pathos in a tracksuit?As the evening warms up however (dramatically rather than atmospherically – this is still the very chilliest auditorium and blankets are advised) some witty touches emerge. The double-suicide attempt by Princess Aristea (Rosa Bove) and her beloved Megacle (Emily Fons) that sees each perched precariously on matching plinths is a comic highlight, while the actual Games make full use of the generous spaces of Garsington’s auditorium and surrounding gardens, delighting with slow-motion effects and even a cheeky musical quotation (I won’t spoil it) from the orchestra.After grabbing attention with his small role in last summer’s Glyndebourne Rinaldo, countertenor Tim Mead returns here in the lead. While not the most vocally demonstrative of roles, Licida offers ample opportunity for this musical young singer to show his skill, taking the evening’s laurel wreath with the miraculous, controlled stillness of “Mentre dormi”. For coloratura fireworks all the emphasis was on Michael Maniaci’s Aminta, who after a rather wayward start in his intonation delivered some impressively articulated showpieces, including the ear-bending contortions of “Siam navi”While Ruby Hughes’s giddy, loveable Argene (rather underused, and perhaps working a little too hard to compensate) was the only singer to match the production for sheer energy, it was Emily Fons in the difficult role of Megacle who shone. Genuinely boyish in manner, she brought something real to the friendship with Licida on which the whole tortuous plot hangs, somehow balancing this sincerity with the rather stylised context of the production. Technically absolutely secure, with a flexible warmth to her tone, she’s a mezzo to sway even the most ardent of countertenor devotees.A weak turn from Bove’s Aristea and a rather scrappy chorus were balanced by Riccardo Novaro’s Clistene, and characteristically authoritative support from William Berger’s Alcandro. Holding it all together, Laurence Cummings powered his band into swift speeds and stylish gestures, extracting all possible colour from Vivaldi’s orchestration.Offering a nice enough evening of summer opera, elevated by a seriously classy cast, L’Olimpiade is not the work to establish its composer in the contemporary opera house. It does however reaffirm Garsington’s own musical credentials as the place to hear the stars before they become stars. Next year please, just no more Vivaldi.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/lolimpiade-garsington-opera,
613,"La Bohème, Welsh National Opera",La Bohème,Welsh National Opera,2012-06-02,stephen Walsh,"Of all Romantic operas, La Bohème is perhaps the one that responds best to what one might, for want of a better phrase, call straight theatrical treatment. It’s pure genre: no hidden meanings, no contemporary significance. “Scenes from the life”, as Murger called his book, now barely readable. Puccini’s opera, likewise, is short on continuity, long on atmosphere, very long on sentiment. Why would anyone bother with it?Annabel Arden’s new production for WNO answers that question more than convincingly. She makes no great statements; we’re not lectured on art as redemption or disease as moral sickness. The action is not transported to the White House or the Welsh Assembly, Rodolfo is not reimagined (if that’s the right word) as Andrew Motion locked in an affair with Amy Winehouse. Instead we are in a Paris garret, perhaps a shade more recently than Murger, but not damagingly so; there is a big window, a chair and a stove. Momus is still in business. The marketers still need passports to get into the city at dawn. The artists starve and the snow falls. God’s in his heaven.I enjoyed this production and found it touching and very much to the point. Arden tweaks things here and there. Her Mimi blows her candle out deliberately (twice), which I think is a gloss on Puccini, though an entirely plausible one. The last act seems to be in a slightly different garret from the first – and maybe just, in its barrenness, there is the faintest hint of a symbolic point about the death of the heart, except that, here especially, the heart doesn’t die but somehow outlives the squalor and the seeming futility of young love.  The designer, Stephen Brimson Lewis, comes up with a witty and effective adaptation of the front drop, into something like a Victorian Christmas card that opens out from a diamond-shaped centre aperture on to each scene. This both captures and defuses any sentimentality; I found it charming.But needless to say the reason why the question is answered lies with the music. Puccini will always have his high-minded critics, but musicians know that few composers have had his mastery of the theatrical genre: his genius for dramatic pacing, his quality of ideas immaculately presented, his sheer expertise with the medium. Audiences have always known this as well, by the way, but shamefacedly, as if it were an unserious preference. In fact it shows excellent taste, though one might wish they could grow out of cheering “Che gelido manina” and (always slightly less spontaneously) “Mi chiamano Mimì”, as if it were part of the score.Musetta’s waltz is a different case, because the sheer brilliance of the scene – the people, the children, the onstage band – draws us in as part of the crowd, and if we cheer then (we didn’t this time) we become temporary extras, part of the setting. I don’t know any operatic act that’s so prodigal with snatches of marvellous ideas thrown away like casual conversation, except possibly in Verdi’s Falstaff – a recent work that must have influenced Puccini. And how concise it all is! You could get most of La Bohème into one act of Tristan, WNO’s last offering. Yet Puccini is inconceivable without Wagner.Carlo Rizzi, the company’s former music director, has conducted Wagner here, but Puccini is his element. He has an Italian’s natural instinct for the lyrical flow combined with discreet symphonic texture that was more or less a Puccini invention. The orchestra play for him as if the music were in their veins. And if balance with the stage was mildly awry here and there, that was partly the director’s fault for upstaging her singers at tricky moments. This is a big theatre, while for singing Bohème the lyrical and the sprightly are more essential than the robust.Alex Vicens, the Rodolfo, is an occasional victim, with his somewhat pinched upper register and small physique, though both technically and emotionally he’s well on top of the music, and a sensitive, engaging actor. His love episodes with Anita Hartig’s Mimì are genuinely affecting, while never losing sight of their ephemeral quality of a one-night stand. No Liebestod in this garret, even if Rodolfo does let rip a tiny spot in C sharp minor over her corpse. Hartig, a Romanian soprano not heard here before, is something of a find, exquisitely tender onstage, with a lovely, easy top register, and needing only perhaps a touch more projection in the middle of the range. Theirs may be a shortlived passion, but it’s intensely felt, and here perfectly natural.The support is strong. David Kempster (pictured above with Kate Valentine) is a fine, unapologetic Marcello, almost a second hero, and Kate Valentine makes a stylish Musetta, though on this opening night her waltz didn’t quite take off as it can and probably will. David Soar parts with Colline’s coat rather movingly (and uselessly: Mimì is dead by the time he comes back with the cash – somehow this is Bohème in a nutshell). Gary Griffiths is a witty, arty Schaunard. The WNO chorus sparkles as ever at the Café Momus, the inevitable mixture of weirdos, trannies, Parpignol the pedlar (Michael Clifton-Thompson) as a chimpanzee, but all straight as soon as they open their mouths. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-boh%C3%A8me-welsh-national-opera,
614,"Salome, Royal Opera House",Salome,Royal Opera House,2012-06-01,alexandra Coghlan," According to Oscar Wilde’s Salome (and faithfully preserved in Hedwig Lachmann’s libretto), the mystery of love is greater than the mystery of death. That may be so, but neither comes close to equalling the baffling mystery that is still David McVicar’s production. Not trusting the simple reds, moons and veils of Wilde’s stylised original to conjure sufficient horror, McVicar takes his abused heroine to Nazi Germany by way of Pasolini and a backstory of physical and psychological trauma. Then he throws in an abattoir and plenty of blood.To take such abstraction, the allusive possibility of Wilde’s language and Aubrey Beardsley’s images, and turn them into something so literal is to take a risk, especially in a climate of unshockable opera audiences. It’s an approach that must work ever harder as the night continues, striving again and again for the ultimate coup de théâtre (naked breasts, buttocks and of course blood all playing their part), but whose efforts see exponentially less return as we become hardened to it all.Es Devlin’s designs are a miracle of grotty evocation however, with the split-level set giving us just a hint of Downton Abbey above stairs and Saw (via Salò) downstairs, a (de)basement that sits somewhere between municipal baths and abattoir. Curving its way steeply down between the floors is a staircase on which our cast can only descend. Return from such depths is, it seems, impossible.The main problem is one of tone. The death of Narraboth is deliberately bathetic – a background action that barely impinges on the foreground except as light relief, yet is balanced by a Dance of the Seven Veils that abandons straightforward eroticism in favour of a complex psychological sequence of tableaux. To the accompaniment of some terrific creaking from swift-moving sets (not quite the equal of Rigoletto’s for volume, but equally distracting) we witness Salome and Herod (Denoke and Andersen, pictured right) moving through seven rooms, the seven stages of her corruption from innocence to all-but incestuous rape. It’s a clever enough conceit, but this sudden interest in psychology and interiority seems at odds with the rest of a production that seems happy to daub itself with politics and naked women as a substitute for substance.Given the right cast and the right conductor, none of this would matter. Last night we were half way there. Andris Nelsons galvanised the pit into a gasping frenzy of passion, giving Strauss’s score all the space (and pace) it needs to flourish. Brass emerged epic, daringly held back for much of the evening (though still not enough to fix projection issues from the stage) so as to heighten the climaxes. The music emerged as a single breathed gesture, the sonic equivalent of Devlin’s staircase – inevitable and organic in its descent.On stage things were rather more mixed. A role debut from Rosalind Plowright as Herodias was authoritative and touching, vocally secure and with enough sexiness to play emotively into the tension with her daughter. Likewise Stig Andersen’s Herod, though sung primarily for character rather than beauty, was vivid but never caricatured, throwing disconcerting emphasis back onto the deranged Salome herself. Egils Silins has the Old Testament voice to take on the rather loaded dice of cartoon prophet Jokanaan, but achieved nothing approaching chemistry with his seductress.For all her experience in this demanding role, Angela Denoke (pictured above) has never felt like a natural or easy vocal fit for it. In 2010 she was just about solid through it, but last night seemed out of her depth both musically and dramatically. Singing persistently flat, and lacking both the gilded sheen at the top (Salome’s much-needed innocence – so necessary if McVicar’s insistence on chastity is to come off) or the power and grit at the bottom (her insistent demands for Jokanaan’s head were never quite the shock they should have been), she also seemed unable to follow any phrase to its conclusion. Endings were snatched and brutal, disrupting the seamless line of music from Nelsons and the orchestra, and muting their technicolour diversity into a single vocal shade. Physically stiff, we saw too little of the child-innocent at the start to really lament her collapse, and too little sex appeal to really believe it.Salome is a score you could stage in a shoebox and still come away from overwhelmed, and Nelsons’ rendering alone makes this revival worth the price of a ticket. Though detailed and determined, McVicar’s staging still feels muddled compared to the searing emotional clarity of the score. Excess on the page here is a dizzying delight, on stage it just seems like a mess.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/salome-royal-opera-house,
615,"Caligula, English National Opera",Caligula,English National Opera,2012-05-26,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"Mass murder. Incest. Rape. Madness. This is quite a lot to be getting on with for a three-hour opera. Too much perhaps. Indeed, German composer Detlev Glanert seems so busy trying to pack in all the Grand Guignol elements that one expects from a portrait of Caligula that he never quite gets around to saying anything interesting about any of it. All we learn about tyranny - the work's main theme - is that it is cruel, it knows no limits and that it consumes and begets itself. I'm sure Albert Camus's original 1944 play talks much more about existential cause. About the only moment that approaches the level of an original idea is the work's riff on the theatricality of power. But this topic was explored more interestingly by director Benedict Andrews.Andrews has lots of ideas. This will not surprise any of those who caught his exceptional The Return of Ulysses last year. His visuals are striking. In a nod to the Coliseum's namesake, he plants us for the duration of the evening at the English National Opera in the terraces of a modern stadium (main picture). It's clever compositionally, in that the raking allows for a more engaging spread of activity than a flatter stage would, as well as, to a certain extent, conceptually. Stadia are beloved of autocrats. The bloody spectacle of authoritarianism relies on them - for rallies as much as for mass executions. This modern despot and his court seem at home here.They are joined in the stands by plenty of familiar faces. Ronald MacDonald. Kermit the Frog. Mickey Mouse. A team of generic cheerleaders. Symbols of Western capitalism. I understand the basic point he is trying to make. That tyranny is a form of show that tries to hide the truth through diversion. And that (for some) consumerist capitalism behaves in a similar fashion. But ancient tyrannies have even more in common with other tyrannies. And we're not short of them at the moment. For a director to focus largely on the similarities that consumerist capitalism may have with Caligula's evils and for him only in passing to reference today's real-life Caligulas strikes me as pretty morally bankrupt. Worse than that, the Žižekian idea of a zonked-out capitalist life being as bad as one that is lived under authoritarianism is not only wrong, it's a cliché. And it made a rather fresh bit of direction suddenly look very tired.Normally at this point in a review one homes in on the white knights. Opera always has its white knights. Singers who snatch the evening from the jaw's of eternal boredom. Arias whose sweetness eradicates all memories of what has gone before. The nearest we got to this was conductor Ryan Wigglesworth, who, whenever he was given the chance, delivered much of subtlety and delicacy.Beyond this, mediocrity reigned. Glanert's neo-Romantic score, though intermittently intriguing when hushed of voice, engaged too often in hackneyed musical tropes - organ dissonances for moments of tension, harps and flutes for repose, choral minimalism for night-time reflection. Little of the singing was memorable. Then again very few of the singers received much memorable material. Yvonne Howard's Caesonia, Caligula's wife, clung to her man convincingly enough. Caligula's lackey, Helicon (Christopher Ainslie, pictured above right), turned out as a Caravaggio boy, has a pretty aria at the start of the second half. Amanda Holden's translation sounded far too much like a translation.All of this, however, might not have mattered but for one thing: Caligula. Ultimately, a portrait piece like this lives or dies by the lead performance. And sadly Peter Coleman-Wright (pictured above left) had none of the stage presence or vocal flexibility needed to make Caligula's petulant ways anything but of passing interest. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/caligula-english-national-opera,
616,"Classical CDs Weekly: Massenet, David Russell, Weinberg",Classical CDs Weekly: Massenet,David Russell,2012-05-26,graham Rickson," Massenet: Werther Rolando Villazón, Sophie Koch, Orchestra of the Royal Opera House/Antonio Pappano (DG)Massenet’s Goethe adaptation needs a lot of love to make it convince as a drama. Fortunately this live Covent Garden performance, taped last May, has Antonio Pappano at the helm. There’s no one better at glossing over the piece’s longueurs. You need someone who can make you forget Werther’s clunkiness, its occasional risible moments. I can never maintain a straight face in Act 3 when Charlotte learns of Werther’s fateful message: “ I am leaving on a lengthy journey. Will you lend me your pistols?” Rolando Villazón plays the unfortunate hero. The voice isn’t as alluring as it was. But it’s still commanding, and Villazón does make make Werther a credible protagonist. He’s more than matched by Sophie Koch’s Charlotte, able to imply so much depth of feeling with the slightest of vocal gestures. Villazón’s performance can’t help feeling slightly hammy by comparison.No, buy this set for the white-hot orchestral playing. Brief orchestral interludes erupt with colour under Pappano and the score’s fruitier outbursts are incandescent, a good example being Werther’s declaration of love near the close of Act 1. Massenet’s deftly orchestrated music is always interesting enough to hold one's attention. So much depends on the two leads that it’s easy to overlook the supporting cast. Stuart Patterson and Darren Jeffrey don’t irritate as Schmidt and Johann, and Eri Nakamura is vibrant as Charlotte’s sister Sophie. The stage and audience noise add the right level of ambience without becoming intrusive. Good notes and a full libretto.Pappano and Villazón discuss WertherWeinberg: Cello Concerto, Symphony no 20 Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra/Thord Svedlund, with Claes Gunnarson (Cello) (Chandos)Very, very occasionally you come across unknown pieces of music which have an instant, overwhelming physical impact. You want to pick them up and hug them, before discreetly introducing them to trusted friends. Mieczysław Weinberg’s 1948 Cello Concerto is one of those works, an understated jewel. This composer’s star is finally in the ascendant. The operas The Passenger and The Portrait have been performed in the UK, and this most elusive of 20th-century composers is beginning to emerge from the shadow of his mentor Shostakovich. The opening Adagio of the concerto is a stunner, an effortless, lyrical outpouring which has haunted me for weeks. The three subsequent movements are almost as good; a Spanish-inflected moderato, a folky scherzo and a wonderful, valedictory finale which could make a sensitive listener sob. It’s supremely performed by Claes Gunnarson.The coupling is a tougher sell; Weinberg’s Symphony No 20 is pitch black and macabre, the melancholy tone lightened by occasional glimpses of dark humour. The ageing composer wrote on the manuscript, “With the help of God I may yet manage to write this one. But I don’t believe so.” Sparely scored, it’s oddly affecting if ultimately depressing, the C major coda grey and sardonic rather than triumphant. Beautiful sound and excellent performances from Thord Svedlund’s Gothenburg Orchestra.The Grandeur of the Baroque: Music by Bach, Handel, Couperin and Weiss David Russell (guitar) (Telarc)Is this a daft title for an album? Surely the whole point of transcribing baroque keyboard music for classical guitar is to get away from notions of grandeur and letting us hear these works in a more intimate, subtle way. The modern guitar can do many things, but grandeur isn’t one of them. Anyway, David Russell’s playing is both effortless and compelling, and shows how sensitive transcriptions can help us hear the familiar with fresh ears. Russell’s initially improvisatory take on a Bach toccata taken from the Partita in E minor is breathtaking, the fingerwork as he tackles the fugue section beyond reproach. It just sounds right. As does Handel’s Suite no 7 in G minor. I listened to this work first on harpsichord; after several effortful minutes it was a huge relief to return to Russell’s softer-grained guitar version.Couperin’s Vingt-Sixiéme Ordre is lighter fare. His subtitles to each of the four movements raise a smile; it’s hard to resist pieces with names like La Convalescente and L’Epineuse. Russell’s ornamentation defies belief – trills so neat that it’s hard to believe you’re not hearing a keyboard player. I confess to not having heard a note by Silvius Leopold Weiss before listening to the suite which concludes this disc. You realise why you’ve not come across him before: the music is attractive but sadly anonymous. Baroque muzak. But the Bach, Handel and Couperin transcriptions are magnificent.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/classical-cds-weekly-massenet-david-russell-weinberg,
617,"La Cenerentola, Glyndebourne Festival Opera",La Cenerentola,Glyndebourne Festival Opera,2012-05-24,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"Rossini's La Cenerentola is not an opera that I'd normally recommend to anyone with even half a brain. It takes the simple if mildly nauseating little tale of Cinderella, pads it out with parental abuse and drawn out cliffhangers, and ends in a pass-the-sick-bag denouement of ""Goodness Triumphant"". Yet, in an act worthy of the fairy godmother herself, Glyndebourne has transformed the piece into something unmissable. As ever with this classy East Sussex institution, the thing that raises proceedings above the level of panto is the extraordinary casting. The first delights that we're treated to, as the torn curtain is lifted on the humble home of wicked stepfather Don Magnifico, are the voices of the ugly sisters. The fizz and zip that Elena Xanthoudakis (Clorinda) and Victoria Yarovaya (Tisbe) invest in their opening lines is so attractive that it completely undermines the possibility that they might not be the ones we're supposed to root for. Their rivalry, jealousy and vanity is never anything less than irresistable, especially when fate periodically turns against them and we see them dropping to the floor in fits of fainting.Next to them and their compellingly grubby, grasping step father (Umberto Chiummo), Cinders doesn't half come across as an annoying drip, deserving of everything she's got coming. Elizabeth DeShong's characterisation doesn't do much to dispel this line of thought. Character-wise, then, we are forced to look to the edges for our entertainment. But vocally, DeShong repays full attention. Hers was the most confidant display of coloratura I've heard for a while. Her victory over and forgiveness of those around her unleashed runs that burst outward towards us in pride and inwards in false modesty. Notes were tossed up and out into the air and hummed down and back into her throat. But the interest went beyond the girls. Taylor Stayton's Don Ramiro was the perfect all-round Italian Prince Charming, his love for Cinders spurring him on to some splendid vocalised passion. The sisters weren't allowed to hog all the comic limelight. Armando Noguera's Dandini, in disguise as his master Don Ramiro, fooled around with the girls with exquisite timing and campness. Only Shenyang's Alidoro (the Fairy Godmother role) failed ever to catch fire. Conductor James Gaffigan made sure the London Philharmonic Orchestra kept to a rip-roaring pace in the pit.Most fun was to be had when the lead protagonists came together and fired off each other like a pin ball machine. As a vocal sextet, you couldn't ask for more. Cenerentola demands a good team at the top. Not only do they have to divert attention away from the glaring lack in the libretto, but every end of scene coming together, where the antics of the previous minutes stun each character into temporary united reflection, needs a clever blend of vocal colour. This is exactly what happened. These moments of suspended time were undoubtedly the high points of the evening, as the lights dimmed on the Biedermeier sets and refocussed on the interior life of the characters at the front of the stage.Peter Hall's revival production (last seen in 2005) was strong and straight (punctuated beautifully by the lighting designs of Peter Mumford), if a little stiff. The larking about was stock. But the benefit of Hall's refusal to engage the work just for laughs meant that he could focus on relationships in a way that just about held our intellectual attention. And it also meant that he could end with a serious final thought. With eternal happiness in the bag, Cinderella begins to bask a little too much in the adulation that she is receiving for all her good works. An overdue reminder that too much virtue can quite quickly become a vice.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-cenerentola-glyndebourne-festival-opera,
618,"The Cunning Little Vixen, Glyndebourne Festival Opera",The Cunning Little Vixen,Glyndebourne Festival Opera,2012-05-21,David Nice,"Glyndebourne nature, it seems, runs along as smoothly as the much discussed new wind turbine on the hill. Within the theatre, though, all is flux: director Melly Still and Vladimir Jurowski, conducting an incandescent London Philharmonic Orchestra, show just how flexible it's possible to be with the viciousness and the vivacity in Janáček's kaleidoscope of birth, copulation, death and a redemption of sorts in celebration of the natural order.What the composer challengingly called ""a merry thing with a sad end"" is not, as some past productions have played it, an animal fable for children. Vixen Sharp Ears is taken away from her natural habitat by the gruff Forester, creates murderous mayhem at his lodge, mates, breeds and dies of unnecessary bravado facing the barrel of a poacher's gun; all this can be comprehended and even accepted by kids. They're less likely to be impressed by ageing humans grappling with illusions and disillusionment - a downward spiral from which the Forester, unlike his village pals, eventually escapes by going back to nature.At Glyndebourne there is no disappointment in the shift of mood from natural life around the central tree of Tom Pye's magical designs to grumblings down the pub. Jurowski paces his diaphanous orchestra perfectly from a light and airy start, woodwind glinting through leafy strings, to the surges of rapture for the Vixen's dreams of girlhood and an even more passionate rhapsody - what Janáček meant by it, who knows, but it's gorgeous - for the apparently disgruntled Forester once his catch has got away. The belated unleashing of the composer's more baleful sounds in his eerie writing for lower brass is chillingly realised as poacher Harasta (William Dazeley) stalks the forest at the beginning of the eventful last act.Rightly, the showiest energy belongs to the vulpine members of the cast. Lucy Crowe's restless Vixen is a wild child quick to assert her independence. The lustrous stops this gifted lyric soprano is able to pull out in a half-animal, half-human kind of courtship, where the earthiness is in the text and a deeper love-music glows in the orchestra, find their match in Emma Bell's ardent bohemian Fox. The Forester of veteran Sergei Leiferkus (pictured right) makes a different journey from brusque appropriation of nature to a mellow sense of reconciliation with it. Leiferkus can still rise  to the lyric challenge of the great final scene in which his character perhaps learns to face death (his ultimate rest beneath the big tree is ambiguous, as it should be).His sorry companions, doubled in the animal world as Janáček somewhat randomly decided they should be, are Mischa Schelomianski's lugubrious Priest and the Schoolmaster of Adrian Thompson, a model of clarity in tragicomic suffering. Terynka, the red-haired object of his affections with whom the Vixen is confused more plausibly than usual in this production, puts in an appearance towards the end when she marries Harasta and gets a new fox muff as a special present.Costume designer Dinah Collin has fun with a feisty anthropomorphic view of the animal world, so long as you can work out who's supposed to be what: jumpered foxes hand-manipulating their bushy tails with uncanny dexterity, bobble-hatted rabbits, a tawdry showgirl line-up of hens dispatched by the Vixen along with their male chauvinist cockerel, a peasant cow no doubt called Marigold as she yields a rubber glove to be ""milked"" by the Forester, and bathing-suited flower maidens. The mix of pell-mell action with Maxine Doyle's choreography can seem a bit random, and not always entirely clear, least of all in the Vixen's ultimately fatal brinksmanship, but it's executed with spirit by a lively mixture of chorus, actors and children. It also fits as happily into Glyndebourne's relatively intimate scale as does the detailed shimmer of Jurowski's orchestra.The changing seasons, evocatively lit by Paule Constable, are effortlessly achieved. The softer, more picture-book effects of the greens and browns of late summer at the beginning and end as well as a spring flowering for the foxy wooing and wedding (pictured left) are interspersed with starker scenes: sheets of snow deck the perilous path that runs from top to bottom of the stage and doubles as the badger's sett occupied by the Vixen, and just after her death the tree turns blood-red before revealing itself in a harsher light as the pile of splinters that it is - a hint of nature's despoliation as powerful as the sense of ecological waste Still created in her equally perceptive Glyndebourne production of Dvořák's Rusalka. The final liberation, though, is unequivocal, the orchestra ringing out the bells of that ""more than earthly joy"" the Forester has sung about in his epiphany as his double mounts the winding path in extraordinary perspective. With any luck, you'll walk out into the sunshine of a Sussex evening sharing that exhilaration.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/cunning-little-vixen-glyndebourne-festival-opera,
619,"Tristan und Isolde, Welsh National Opera",Tristan und Isolde,Welsh National Opera,2012-05-20,stephen Walsh,"Welsh National Opera has a good track record with Wagner. Its Meistersinger of two summers ago is already the stuff of legend (and alas not likely to return to reality); farther back one recalls a more than respectable Parsifal, a notable Ring cycle, and an old Tristan under Goodall that’s still talked about in hushed whispers.This more recent Tristan, itself almost two decades old, belongs strictly to a new era. Nowadays WNO does original language and books international singers, which in theory – if not always in practice – lifts its productions out of the provincial league. It also has the Millennium Centre, a kind of poor man’s Bayreuth, with superb acoustics, a wonderful spread of sound, and first-rate sightlines. Top singers, one suspects, enjoy singing here; and top singers are often to be heard in the Land of Song – even, from time to time, Welsh ones. The current revival sports at least two, possibly three, who would be an adornment to Bayreuth.It has its problems, too; but what Tristan doesn’t? In the Master’s own theatre they’ve virtually given up on those aspects of the work that were demonstrably closest to his heart: the sense in which the stage picture is a direct projection of the spirit and content of the music. By contrast, Yannis Kokkos’s staging in Cardiff is orthodox. It dresses its characters out of the medieval wardrobe and locates them in “correct” but uninsistent settings: a ship (or at least a thing with a sail), a sort of garden with a house wall and a light, a rocky coast.Mostly it leaves them space to move and relate, which, under Peter Watson’s guidance in this revival, they do pretty well, though not without the odd crasher – literally, when the lovers collapse with one accord after drinking the potion, ruining the whole symbolic idea that the potion opens their hearts because they believe it will shortly kill them. But I shan’t complain about a production that generally respects the score so well and – not least – that shows us the front curtain during the prelude. For once, no Morold ballet, no tableau vivant of King Mark dispatching Tristan to Ireland, no dumb show of Wagner seducing Matthilde Wesendonck. Just a curtain, and that incomparable prelude, beautifully played.When the curtain does go up, at precisely the moment indicated in the score (help!), we’re treated to half an hour of some of the most beautiful Wagner singing I can remember, starting with Simon Crosby Buttle’s Sailor (placed, though, too far backstage, as incidentally is his Shepherd’s cor anglais in Act III). Ann Petersen (pictured above right with Ben Heppner, image by David Massie) is immediately perfection as Isolde, and mostly she stays that way. Hers is a lighter, more lyrical voice than the conventional Wagner soprano, and she floats Isolde’s lines as if they were Schubert, lovely and effortless, though with ample power when needed, hardly ever sounding forced.One might sit back, shut one’s eyes and simply listen. But one would miss a great deal, because this is a Wagnerian who can act, with presence and total engagement, and she even looks the part. When Brangaene enquires: “Who could see Isolde and not die happy?” for once one doesn’t wince at the irony. Above all, Petersen knows how to carry her looks into the role; her Isolde is a creature who loves and who one can imagine loving, something that in this work usually has to be supplied by the imagination.As for Susan Bickley’s Brangaene, it’s enough to say that she is not upstaged. She, too, is a soprano who can treat Wagner as pure vocal line. Later, in her tower in Act II, she captures unforgettably the haunting fusion of time suspended but about, catastrophically, to move on – a stretch of score I always like to think captivated Debussy, though of course he misread it (as Harold Bloom would say) to suit himself.Bickley, too, is good on stage, a slightly fragile presence but not without a certain self-deprecating authority: a companion as much as a servant. She and Petersen are a match made in heaven, compulsively listenable to and watchable.It would be straining goodwill to say the same of Ben Heppner’s Tristan or Philip Joll’s Kurwenal. Joll, who sang Wotan on this stage 30 years ago, is still a fine, somewhat ageing squire to behold, but his vocal line betrays him a little too often for comfort. Heppner has his moments, and survives the third act, curiously enough, more impressively than the second, though the survival is relative in both cases. Too often the voice splits or the tuning goes; and once you start fearing for a tenor in this part you’re done for where suspended disbelief is concerned. Heppner’s figure is against him, too. Enough said. The best male singing comes from Matthew Best, a moving, steady-voiced Mark, and from Simon Thorpe’s Melot, the ultimate walk-on part but often, unfortunately, cast too weak.The orchestral playing is beautiful throughout: much exquisite solo playing, a few moments of dodgy wind tuning – but Wagner does not make things easy (how can some of these chordings have sounded in Munich in 1865: music completely outside the players’ experience?). Whether Lothar Koenigs is yet utterly at home in this score is an open question. Everything is well under control, but the music’s contour is low, and its natural surge slow to come. It is, at present, a somewhat cautious Tristan. The frenzy is perhaps waiting in the wings.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/tristan-und-isolde-welsh-national-opera,
620,"Falstaff, Royal Opera",Falstaff,Royal Opera,2012-05-16,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"I didn't know whether to sigh or to yawn. Another opera. Another 50s set. At least it started well. In an obsessively wood-panelled hunting lodge, fat Falstaff (Ambrogio Maestri) lies in his bed in filthy long johns amid a sea of empty silver platters, working out a way to pay his bills and satisfy his lust. Not a 50s cliché in sight - yet. The banter between him and his helpers - Pistol and Bardolph - is focused and easy. And the singing from Maestri is effortless and clear and delivered in a parlando manner of exquisite style and grace. My, you could almost see beyond the grime and the gut and begin to understand what his two targets, Meg Page (Kai Ruutel) and Alice Ford (the splendid Ana Maria Martinez, pictured below with Maestri), see in the man. The next scene, in which the women appear, is even better. The music at this point is fantastic, with as much interesting vocal scene-setting as orchestral. Both the central quartet of ladies, and conductor Daniele Gatti, relish all the colour and sotto voces Verdi throws at them. The girls' back-and-forth over lunch, joking at the expense of their catches as if we were with Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda, is a delight, helped by some beautiful character acting from the bouncy Marie-Nicole Lemieux (Mistress Quickly). This scene also sees director Robert Carsen looking back to Hollywood when suspending time for a stolen kiss between Nannetta (the radiant Amanda Forsythe) and Fenton (Joel Prietro - consistently vocally sharp).With this early, but effectively final, flourish, Carsen appears to run out of steam. In fact he seems to disappear almost completely. From Act Two Scene Two on, we get nothing but Richard Jones - brightness and madcappery in Fifties outfits - but without the Jones bite. Lovers of Kirstie Allsopp-land will have rejoiced. But for those of us that don't melt at the mere sight of a baby-blue Roberts radio, Carsen needed to do more. He's way too uninterested, for example, in making any honest sense of the unrealistic and plodding confusions of the where's-Falstaff scene (Is he in this drawer? Is he in this fruit bowl? Is he under this spoon?) That the Royal Opera have a horse (Rupert) who had better comic timing than much of the rest of the show doesn't help. And the way the huge, creaky wood-panelling of the first scene maintains its presence into the kitchen scene, the stable and the hunt feels kind of cheap. The strange final scene, however, shows up Carsen the most. Having the whole cast trussed up as a bunch of tally-ho toffs doesn't kindle the kind of feelings of warmth in one's fellow man I think Verdi had in mind here. And the final philosophical pan-out comes across (as ever) as a bit of a mess. Then again, ending with a huntsman's feast went down a treat last night in the auditorium. A home from home for some. A vision of hell for me. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/falstaff-royal-opera,
621,"Madam Butterfly, English National Opera",Madam Butterfly,English National Opera,2012-05-09,alexandra Coghlan,"Origami birds flock in graceful chorus, a dancer flutters two fans into a pulsing captive butterfly, curtains of cherry blossom descend over glowing paper lanterns, and of course a small bunraku puppet steals the show. Seven years on Anthony Minghella’s Madam Butterfly is as beautiful as ever, and – if possible – even more Japanese.This Olivier Award-winning production is up there with Jonathan Miller’s Mafia Rigoletto as one of English National Opera’s all-time stars, and for its visual aplomb and emotive excess deserves every bit as long a career. Revived here by Sarah Tipple, the show has the odd clumsy moment (which will doubtless improve through the run) but benefits from the return of two of the opera’s original cast – Mary Plazas as the tragic Butterfly, and Gwyn Hughes Jones as Pinkerton.After Bryan Hymel’s strained performance in the 2009 revival, Hughes Jones makes a welcome appearance to reclaim his role. His is not the largest of voices (and certainly a minnow compared to the heft on offer up the road at the Royal Opera House) but there are colours there beautiful enough to rival even Michael Levine’s sets, and Hughes Jones deploys them well. Never over-singing but romping up to Pinkerton’s insistently high climaxes with absolute commitment, Hughes Jones’s only weakness comes in the ensembles where his lack of brute power can unbalance things slightly. His legato however (showcased best in a glowing “Dovunque al mondo”) offers generous compensation.Few operatic suspensions of disbelief are greater than those demanded by the vocal challenges of Puccini’s 15- (and latterly 18-) year-old heroine. Mary Plazas (pictured right with Hughes Jones as Pinkerton) like many before her offers a maturity that flourishes best in Act II, but which fails to give the role the joyous innocence Puccini surely writes into the chattering interruptions and love-talk of his score. Plazas’s Butterfly is tragic from her first uttering, and while it’s an impressively controlled dramatic performance (and her characterful husk in lower registers and the resonance of her floated pianissimos do their work well) it still lacks arc.Pamela Helen Stephens is quietly establishing herself as an unexpected star at ENO, and her Suzuki marks another major step forward. Stephens proved in last year’s The Return of Ulysses that she can do dramatic intensity, and here it was harnessed to some seriously weighty singing, tempered for the Flower Duet into glowing warmth, but later released at its full force. Less successful was John Fanning’s Sharpless who made the Consul even more of a cipher than usual, and failed to bring much by way of sheen to his singing. Oleg Caetani’s rather indulgent speeds didn’t help, but others coped with these rather better. Less indulgence could also be wished of the brass section, whose triumphant moments risked obliterating the tender fragility of Minghella's staging, not to mention most of the singing.David Parry’s libretto doesn’t improve with acquaintance, and all Minghella’s vernacular imagery goes for naught when trapped in such sung banalities as “a multi-purpose dwelling”, while Sharpless’s “Goddam that Bastard Pinkerton” is still funny rather than stirring. Escaping textual hindrances, Sorrow’s many black-clad puppeteers still bring unnatural life and pathos to their wooden charge, and it would take a stern viewer indeed not to be a little bit susceptible to this expressive creature.It’s hard to believe, looking at the assured manipulation of stage space and planes of action that this was Minghella’s first opera production. As a visual spectacle it is beyond reproach, but there’s something in the gauzy loveliness of it all that still sticks in the throat.Concealing the ugliness of the tale behind sliding screens, transforming blood into flowing scarves, a real bastard child into a puppet, Minghella risks a dangerous complicity with Puccini. Both score and set conspire to shroud Butterfly in romance, to elevate a grubby intrigue into a grand passion. The result is faithful and beautiful, but lacks the piquant clarity of productions that read against the grain and strip this Orientalist epic back to the warped skeleton concealed behind cherry blossom, or under the many silken folds of a kimono.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/madam-butterfly-english-national-opera,
622,"Carousel, Opera North",Carousel,Opera North,2012-05-06,graham Rickson,"Feeling apprehensive about opera companies tackling Broadway musicals is understandable. So if you’re still wincing at the memory of Leonard Bernstein’s excruciating 1980s recording of West Side Story, relax - director Jo Davies’s intention was to cast “opera singers who can really, really act” and avoid the potential pitfalls of a fully-fledged operatic approach. And the singing in this new production is consistently good; brilliant in places.There’s also the luxury of hearing James Holmes’s full orchestra play Richard Rodgers’s score, though you can’t help feeling that Don Walker’s recently restored orchestrations are largely responsible for the sonic thrills. Does any mainstream piece of musical theatre sound this sophisticated – those flecks of harp, the stopped horns, the chilly bitonal winds heard just before the Carousel Waltz lurches into motion? Carousel is a fairly close adaptation of Ferenc Molnár’s 1909 play Liliom. Puccini had previously wanted to turn the script into an opera. But Molnár refused to give his permission, happily leaving Rogers and Hammerstein free to finally acquire the rights in 1943.As a piece of mainstream entertainment, this is not a comforting experience. Davies’s recent Ruddigore displayed her alchemical talent for taking lightweight source material and giving it real depth. Carousel is a deeper, darker work, and this is a sombre production at times – Bruno Poet’s lighting is appropriately subdued and Anthony Ward’s inventive, versatile set designs can feel claustrophobic, hemmed in. The crowd scenes are a joy to watch. Nobody just stands and sings – each character, no matter how minor, appears fully formed and vivid. Eric Greene’s Billy Bigelow, (pictured right, with Gillene Herbert) the feckless fairground barker whose tortured redemption gives the piece such clout, is an impressive reading – he really can convey the character’s instability. His restlessness and despair stem from his own harsh upbringing. The moment when his violence towards his wife Julie is revealed comes as a shock, and his entries in Act 1 often send a chill wind through the proceedings. We know that he’ll be redeemed, but watching his descent is still painful. Greene is magnetic – the voice is ripe, rich, and he can act, can move. You despise him, but want him to atone. Gillene Herbert’s Julie is an effective foil, a woman so ground down by her meaningless job in a cotton mill that she’ll grasp at any chance to escape, prepared to marry someone she knows is a bad choice.Supporting roles are consistently well cast. Joseph Shovelton and Claire Boulter (pictured left) offer welcome light relief as Carrie and Enoch, and Michael Rouse’s Jigger exudes sly menace. You forgive the odd bit of flatly delivered dialogue, or the rather perfunctory way in which Bigelow meets his death, for the electrifying final scenes. The moment when the identity of William Kenning’s Heavenly Friend is revealed sends shivers down the spine, nicely preceded by Elena Ferrari and Gillene Herbert’s hesitant, moving rendition of ""You’ll Never Walk Alone"". John Woodvine’s Starkeeper, dressed in spats and cream suit, suggests a 1930s Hollywood mogul. Davies’s neat use of scratchy film footage to give Bigelow a glimpse of his grown-up daughter is magical, as is the moment when the screens lift, revealing her for real. And as we’re exhorted to stand on our own two feet, to go out and give life its best shot, only the hardest of hearts could fail to be moved. Timothy Burke’s well-drilled chorus adds to the pleasure; this is a deeply satisfying evening.Watch the trailer for Opera North's Carousel ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/carousel-opera-north,4
623,"Einstein on the Beach, Barbican Theatre",Einstein on the Beach,Barbican Theatre,2012-05-05,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"Einstein on the Beach was meant to be one of the jewels in the crown for the Cultural Olympiad. The celebrated 1970s collaboration between Philip Glass, Robert Wilson and Lucinda Childs - which Susan Sontag claimed to be one of the greatest theatrical experiences of the 20th century - was receiving its UK premiere at the Barbican Theatre last night, thirty-six years after it was first created. And what we got was a technical shambles.Pretty much everything that could go wrong technically did go wrong. Lighting cues were botched. Drop cloths rose prematurely. Stage hands wandered on from the wings in error. An enormous crane got stuck in the fly system and swung precariously above the performers. They took a break to fix that one. Wilson took the stage to apologise and announce that the flying elements would have to be cut from the penultimate scene. They restarted without half the audience. It would have been embarrasing from an amateur dramatics society let alone the Barbican.The work is complicated, the Barbican Theatre will say in defence. But it wasn't complicated for Montpellier. How is it that a French provincial theatre, where the work was premiered a couple of months ago - and which I saw twice - can completely nail a work such as this, with only one rehearsal, and a supposedly world class venue can foul up so royally? Was there not enough rehearsal time? Was there any rehearsal time at all? Was the work ever really suited to the Barbican? The action seemed squeezed on their tiny stage and minuscule pit. And if they couldn't deal with the demands of the production, should they ever have taken the project on?There was at least one up side to all this. It meant one could explode one of the most oft-repeated myths about Einstein on the Beach: that the work is minimalist. There may be no conventional plot, no conventional meaning, no real drama. The music might unfold at such a glacial pace that it seems not to unfold at all. But musically, theatrically, gesturally, verbally, vocally, visually, and in its terpsichorean and technical elements, Einstein is Baroque. It's bursting at the seams with goings on. Trains and cranes and courts and lovers and guns and Einstein playing the violin (the superb Antoine Silverman) and dancers. Luckily, this fecundity of imagination and activity had the most brilliant cast to make visual sense of it all.And it is a visual sense you're after, not a literary sense. Abstract gestural beauty is the point of Wilson's staging. Look for meaningful drama and you will be disappointed. But look for tableaux of unforgettable freshness and you will be handsomely rewarded. The best scenes are those in which the least happens. A light box rendered as a bright white bar slowly lifts and rises into the heavens. A choir of jurors take lunch. A woman gestures furiously in the top window of a luminous brick building. Singers and dancers file out onto the stage and stand. Yep, just stand. Heels cocked. They catch sight of the woman and leave. In Wilson's hands, all of life's basics - sitting, looking, standing, jumping, eating - are refashioned in such a way as to make them completely mesmerising. I could have watched the bended elbows of Kate Moran (one of two slightly creepy, anonymous and nonsense-spouting comperes) all day.Einstein also has one of the great openings. There's more dramatic tension in the first ten minutes of the work - as singers with unnerving smiles file out and scan the audience - than in most productions in a whole Royal Opera House season. Comparing Einstein to other operas, however, is unfair. There is a link to Virgil Thomson's Four Saints - the only other opera before Einstein to set aside meaning and plot - but Einstein is far closer to performance art than opera in its visually literacy and its exploratory feel.There is also hardly anything that resembles the kind of singing you might see at an opera - even a contemporary one. There is one duet but it is hardly conventional - repeated arpeggios sung to solfege. There are also some ravishing chorales with words replaced by numbers. But mostly we get fiendishly complex choral atmospherics and breathtaking ululation. The latter - fast paced, constantly shifting in rhythm and lightly dissonant - accompanies one of the most thrilling elements of the night: Childs's two twenty-minute dances. With no stage work for the Barbican to fuck up, these set pieces, in which the whole arena is bathed in a pearlescent light, saw the extraordinary Childs dance company electrify the space. The dance starts small, with simple steps, and builds and builds in the manner of Glass's music, through addition and subtraction, all of it in virtuosic sync with the sound of Glass's waves of rich, throbbing music. Evoking the power of a physical force field, the result is kinetic and overwhelming.All this intricate and varied stagework is underpinned by one of Glass's finest scores. It marks the end of his first and most experimental phase - before he entered neo-Romanticism - and amalgamates not just all his compositional techniques up to that point but virtually every Minimalist language of the 60s and early 70s: Harold Budd's electronic fantasias, La Monte Young's drones, the free jazz of Terrys Riley and Jennings, the marimba colour of Reich and his own compositional innovations.It incorporates these languages and scatters them across a generous wealth of instruments among the Philip Glass Ensemble. We get tumescent jazz saxophone riffs (from the frenzied David Crowell), violin solos and neo-Baroque organ fantasias (from conductor Michael Riesman). Minimalist music doesn't get much more lush or surprising. Or catchy. Like in Montpellier, the audience began to hum and headbang. It was hard not to.Many people look upon the five-hour Einstein as an endurance test. But this couldn't be further from the reality of experiencing it. This is an opera that is supremely generous: generous in how it allows you to think, what it allows you to do, what it offers. It's the very opposite of an endurance test. People can come and go. People can snooze. There is in fact enough of a skeleton of a plot - we travel in cryptic mode from childhood to adult love to annihilation - to gently entertain those craving narrative. And the work is so steeped in the context it was written - 70s America - referencing women's lib, Patti Hearst's killing spree, civil rights and the Cold War, that there is even the possibility (for those who care to do the deciphering) to elicit meaning from it all. The technical bungling can't obscure the fact that Einstein is a masterpiece and catching it in whatever state is worth every penny of the £100 plus price tag. Einsteins only come once in a blue moon. See it while you can.Follow @IgorToronyi on Twitter",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/einstein-beach-barbican-theatre,
624,"Maestro at the Opera, BBC Two",Maestro at the Opera,BBC Two,2012-05-05,philip Radcliffe,"Even in this age of desperate reality TV, you have to have doubts about any show that tries to convert “celebrities” into serious contenders in an alien field. Is it serious or a padded-out joke? To an extent we’ve been here, or close by, before. Can it be four years since the first Maestro came to our screens, featuring eight celebrity contestants vying for the chance to wield the baton at the Proms and, eventually, launching the winner, Sue Perkins (narrator this time), on a new career as a comedy conductor?On the basis that if it worked once as a novelty, it might work again given a decent interval, the BBC have dusted down the formula and given it an extra gear.  Last time the contestants “only” had to conduct an orchestra at the Proms. This time it’s opera - an aria in the Royal Opera House, no less. Even the judges are vying for celebrity status. What is Sir Mark Elder as host and chairman of the judges doing in this malarkey?  I’m all for building bridges between the cultural elite and the popular, but I’d rather keep Sir Mark for what he does best – conducting the Halle Orchestra (and others) and opera proper.Anyway, in this first of three programmes, we got to meet the celebs – the effervescent singer/actor Josie Lawrence, the Oxford Maths Professor Marcus du Sautoy (also seeking TV popularity), choreographer Craig  Revel Horwood (Strictly Come Dancing‘s Mr Grumpy, aiming to exhibit some humility) and Trevor Nelson, the Radio 1 DJ who thinks classical music is posh. Throw into the mix a few other celebs, like Lesley Garrett, enthusing about the genre, and Sir Antonio Pappano, intermittently giving some constructive narrative, and you get a bit of top-spin. Mind you, in this muddled production, director Sam Grace dispensed with them part way through.No one ever said conducting was easy and the programme did provide some insight into the demands - knowledge, technique, energy, stamina and communication skills. So, we watched as the participants grappled with the demands from the basics, through intensive training at the Purcell Centre, on to working with singers, conducting an orchestra and, finally, facing an audience and the three judges: Elder, soprano Danielle de Niese and double bassist Dominic Sedis (both pictured above right with Elder). Nerve-wracking to be sure.Each was given an aria to work on – and perform. Lawrence, a conductor feeling for the singer and the song, tackled the ""Habanera"" from Carmen. Nelson took a minimalist and detached approach to ""O mio babbino caro"" from Gianni Schicchi. Du Sautoy, likened to “an axe murderer” by the Purcell tutor, seemed to take Donizetti’s Lucia seriously, though somewhat cold and scientific. And. predictably, Revel Horwood was camp and extravagant with ""The Toreador Song"" from Carmen.The climax was, of course, the firing of one of them, rather like The Apprentice, though not as gripping. The judges went into a huddle. There was a hush in the hall. Elder pronounced du Sautoy and Revel Horwood to go forward. The orchestra voted between the other two: Lawrence survived, Nelson got fired. And, in true pop style, there was much whooping from the audience.But the problem with the show is basic: what is the point and who cares anyway? In that sense, for this viewer at any rate, the supposed competitive element is missing. It’s only supposed to be an hour of light entertainment at the end of the week. But the opera world deserves much better representation than this.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/maestro-opera-bbc-two,
625,"La Bohème, Royal Opera",La Bohème,Royal Opera,2012-05-01,Daniel Ross,"There’s a glamorous grubbiness to John Copley’s returning La Bohème that makes Puccini’s bawdy and romantic romp through the under-lit alleys of Paris’s Latin Quarter especially enjoyable. Beyond the beautifully mournful portrayal of the tortured artist and his suffocating love, there’s something devilishly attractive about it all. If anything, Copley’s direction (he is tonight celebrating 50 years since first directing at the ROH) could do with more grime under its fingernails, or a harsher and less pretty winter to really make his characters suffer in the opening acts. The attic space is a perfect, dejected brown all over, but oh, doesn’t it all look so quixotic and chic? Wouldn’t it be better to be repelled by it?It does feel as if that bawdiness, the cheek and mirth that Rodolfo, Marcello and their rag-tag bunch of hipster friends manage to make in spite of their poverty is in constant threat from the emotional meat of the work. When Mimi, the consumptive wreck and flower embroiderer, turns Rodolfo’s life into one of love and, yes, bohemian merriment, it’s as if the fire goes out – Joseph Calleja is initially rather overpowering of Carmen Giannattasio. Calleja’s admirably tempered aria ""Che gelida manina"" is far stronger than Giannattasio’s answering ""Si, mi chiamano Mimi"", and the audience lets them know with their applause. Still, we’re engaged enough and invested thanks to Calleja and his cohorts (particularly the affably boyish charm of Fabio Capitanucci’s Marcello).The second act is an exquisite set-piece of the highest technical and artistic order. Neatly, and with perfect comic timing, we’re rushed through the worst first date ever, a handbag dog, broken pool cues, smashed plates and a marching band in a little under 20 minutes, which is more than enough to send the assembly chortling into the interval. It’s the the act that most allays the narrative and stays closest to the vignette-ish nature of Henri Murger’s source novel, perhaps something that gets forgotten with each re-staging. While it serves narrative purpose (mostly to introduce Musetta, who’s obviously a scream), this is bravura stuff at its heart. When Musetta (Nuccia Focile, pictured overleaf) finally convinces poor, furious Marcello that he should take her back, the audience are gleefully wishing their quarrels to begin again at the earliest opportunity. But return to the narrative we must. It is to conductor Semyon Bychkov’s eternal credit that he doesn’t give the singers too much room to milk the emotional content of the final two acts, no matter how mawkish it gets. There is plenty of opportunity to let things melt into an unattractive mush, but we rattle through Rodolfo and Mimi (hacking mightily by this point, presumably unable to secure a quick Lemsip) separating against a picturesque, murky backdrop with pleasing results. In no time, we’re back with the boys in the attic – all of whom are titting about in exquisite fashion. Frankly, one could watch them do so all day and not get bored, batting slices of bread at each other and jumping on the bed like schoolboys. Poor Mimi returns, though, more ill than ever and ready to give up, just as soon as she’s been re-united with her Rodolfo. So the silliness has to stop, which makes for a thoroughly disarming change of mood and a brutal emotional punch. By making the scenes of merriment so convincing and plainly enjoyable, the horror of the ending is so much more satisfying and real. Gianattasio has several chances in the libretto to make Mimi stronger, less pathetic, but she doesn’t take them: we’ve lived through the frivolity and now we must equally endure the heartache. When the end comes it is supremely affecting, and indicative of how thoughtful the main players have been this evening. There were weaker elements, and it is slow to accelerate, but embracing the strongest performances this evening was a thorough delight.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-boh%C3%A8me-royal-opera-1,
626,"The Flying Dutchman, English National Opera",The Flying Dutchman,English National Opera,2012-04-29,Charlotte Gardner,"Obsession and redemption, the twin themes of Wagner's ghostly earliest masterpiece, are two words that could just as pertinently be applied to Jonathan Kent's new production for English National Opera. Obsession is how many non-diehard Wagner opera-goers will view Kent's decision to stage this opera as a continuous pieceit' of drama with no interval. Sure, Wagner originally considered a single-act work, but he quickly dropped the idea. He never conducted or endorsed a staging without a break. So, the fashion for running all three acts together almost feels like obsession in its unwillingness to forgo, for once, the usual Wagnerian operatic leitmotif of having to sit still for a very long time. However, thankfully, last night there was also redemption, because after 30 seconds of the overture it was clear that, despite the prospect of over two hours in our seats, this wasn't going to be a clock-watching endurance challenge of an evening. In fact, quite the opposite.Kent's production sets the action in a loosely modern setting, Daland's ship a massive cargo vessel, all corrugated metal and rusting pipes. At the centre of this harsh adult sea environment is an Ikea-like bed bedecked with a childish pink duvet, in which Senta the child (Aoife Checkland), repeatedly fobbed off by her father, takes solace from her book of tales about the flying Dutchman, feeding the obsession that will eventually kill her. However, just as you've got your historical bearings, in crashes the Dutchman's tall-masted sailing ship, rigging and all, whilst American bass James Creswell's Dutchman rises up into Senta's (now empty) bed, complete with Victorian side-burns and tailcoats, and a good century and a half's worth of bitterness on his face. Suddenly, this feels like a serious ghost story.Watch the trailer for the ENO's production of The Flying DutchmanMeanwhile, the singers match superb vocal performances with such convincing acting that the production also feels like a proper drama, rather than like a bunch of opera singers walking through their stage directions. Cresswell, and Orla Boylan as Senta (pictured above), are an electric pairing, and individually captivating. The subdued power in Cresswell's tone as he utters his opening, “The time is up”, is spine-chilling, and its later full-throttled eruption fulfils all the initial promise.Orla Boylan sings a glorious, clear-voiced Senta, by turns ecstatically pure and almost gratingly piercing as the drama requires. She has absolute mastery over her taxing vocal lines and high notes. Her characterisation of this vulnerable, disconnected, bewitched woman come together in her tension-riven Ballade, its surface calm barely keeping at bay the schizophrenic jostle beneath between aggression and tenderness. Stuart Skelton lends dignity to the impotent Erik by the sheer poised beauty of his performance, Robert Murray's aria as the Steersman is true-voiced and tender, and the gentlemen of the ENO chorus (pictured below) have never sounded so good or lifted the roof so high.The real star of the night, though, was musical director Edward Gardner. This was his first Wagner opera as conductor, and he absolutely smashed it. An edge-of-the-seat orchestral adventure ride from the first note, with tempi on the faster side of the spectrum, Gardner's interpretation crackled and smouldered with devilish fire through the many gear-changes in mood and pace. Such was the orchestra's dramatic power that there was a sense of the instrumentalists in the pit being not just the accompaniment, but also narrator and Greek chorus all rolled into one.It wasn't all perfect. Early on, there were a few balance issues between orchestra and soloists. Later, the Act Three trio between Erik, Senta and the Dutchman felt strangely static and awkward. Even more awkward was the segue between Acts Two and Three, which saw Senta engaged in a bizarre slow dance with a hitherto unintroduced member of the Dutchman's crew. Still, these are small gripes. This is one to grab a ticket for.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/flying-dutchman-english-national-opera,
627,"The Importance of Being Earnest, Barbican Hall",The Importance of Being Earnest,Barbican Hall,2012-04-27,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"Gerald Barry's new operatic adaptation of Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest delivers a number of firsts. The first opera score to contain an ostinato for smashed plates. The first orchestra to include a part for pistols and wellington boots. The first opera (that I know of) to offer the role of an aging mother to a male bass. And the first opera I've been to where I've cried with laughter.Granted: on paper it all sounds a bit Chuckle Brothers. Smashing plates, wellies, travesty roles aren't automatically funny at all. But like all the best jokes, these are not jokes. Barry doesn't resort to the plate-smashing etc in order in the first place to make us laugh. He resorts to them in order to get to the truth. And the truth is that the aural metaphor best suited to the famous catfight between the prim belles Gwendolen (the dead pan Katalin Karolyi) and Cecily (the dazzling Barbara Hannigan) in which they find out (or rather, fear they've found out) that they're both betrothed to the same man is undoubtedly the syncopated smashing of plates. This is the sound that gets quickest to the psychological nub of the matter. And Barry follows the action through to the very end of the girls' two-way. Deadpan. Convinced of its own seriousness. Barry's work also improves Wilde's play. A grand claim, possibly, considering many think Wilde's Earnest to be one of the most perfect plays ever written. But for those, like me, who are allergic to Wilde's wit, this is the perfect antidote to and improvement on the urtext. The vocal music (full of the usual Barry acrobatics) destroys the pert one-liners. It tears up the neat little lawns of wit that Wilde has anally manicured. And in its place Barry lays down a proper comedy: one that is wild (and no longer Wilde), modern, genuinely funny and true.And that last point is the most important. Truth, honesty, upfrontness, earnestness is famously the thing that is missing in Wilde's Earnest. This is what Barry's music fills in. The psychological truth. And it's not pleasant listening. The small chamber orchestra - the superb Birmingham Contemporary Music Group under the energetic watch of Thomas Adès - became a heaving, grunting mass of repressed rage at this Barbican European premiere. Different sections burst out at us like spitting pimples. The fortissimo flutter-tonguing horns for the entry of Hannigan's Cecily was one of many memorable orchestral eruptions.The anger even starts to engulf the musical tradition. Several chunks of Beethoven's Ninth are spat out in a disfigured form. ""Auld Lang Syne"" is heard on flute struggling against dense orchestral figures. Several other musical bits and bobs are tossed out at us.  Chabrier-like quotations on the trumpets. A Paisiello-like French Revolutionary march. A G&S pastiche. Even a quote from his own opera The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant. All of it is refracted through Barry's hard-edged musical voice: one of the most punchily attractive there is.Lady Bracknell is made to sound like a Nazi madman The welter of activity is a foil to the cool, calm polish of Wilde's words that creates a kind of schizophrenia: the music doing one thing, the characters another. Thoughts on muffins or Victoria Station are fire-crackered across the singer's vocal spectrum. Peter Tantsits's John Worthing and Joshua Bloom's Algernon Moncrieff deserve special praise for expertly traversing above and beyond their natural range.For Barry every line no matter how trivial has an emotional reservoir running under it. In this he's taking the lead from Wilde who, when asked what the theme of Earnest was, said, ""That we should treat all trivial things in life very seriously, and all serious things of life with a sincere and studied triviality."" In this way, the seemingly innocent admiration of Cecily's physical features by Lady Bracknell (the fabulous Alan Ewing) is pounced upon and made to sound like the ravings of a Nazi madman. In the process, we get something not jolly or surreal but unnervingly laugh-out-loud.The key is Barry's counterintuitive streak. Few other composers would think that the words of Wilde would speak more sharply if one went against their natural rhythms, that one would amplify the humour of the whole by ignoring the careful humour of the specific, that one could be so brash and unpolished with something so delicate and polished. Most other living opera composers seem to be interested in trying to see how words can fit with music, how the music can fit with the plot. For them, it's about homogeny and echo and unified neatness. For Barry, it's about the words and music - about what we say and what we feel - being at war. The result is two hours of unimpeachable brilliance.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/importance-being-earnest-barbican-hall,
628,"La Fille du Régiment, Royal Opera",La Fille du Régiment,Royal Opera,2012-04-20,ASH Smyth,"Since it obviously can't be taken in any way seriously, one big plus for Donizetti’s deeply silly (and, narratively, extremely sketchy) operetta is that it offers everyone plenty of room for manoeuvre(s), an opportunity the Covent Garden team had clearly decided they were not about to miss when putting together this twice-revived production.It is the Swiss Tyrol, sometime in the heyday of the Napoleonic empire, and the local peasants are fleeing from the advancing French troops. Chief among them is the Marquise de Berkenfeld, an elderly dowager type (beleaguered butler as standard) who sounds like she mightn’t altogether rebuff a couple of French advances. But Sergeant Sulpice of the patriotic 21st Regiment assures everyone that peace and good-neighbourliness will be restored in short order, and then introduces his “daughter”, Marie – the ""daughter"" of the entire regiment, in fact – who was, we are told, found, Moses-like, on the field of war 12 years ago, and has since become the regimental mascot and washerwoman: a sort of unskilled Florence Nightingale, in trousers – or Minnie the Minx dropped into a short story by Balzac.Then Tonio turns up (the local love interest – keep up!) to announce his amour for Marie, and the soldiers are all for shooting him as a spy but she pleads for his life on the grounds that he once saved her from falling over a cliff-edge while she was out picking flowers (he did? Well, fair enough then). There’s a lot of hemming and hawwing, though, from the members of the “glorious Twenty-First”, until Marie reluctantly informs our Tonio that she is actually sworn to marry one of them. (Any one, apparently. It doesn’t matter which.)Now the Marquise returns to request safe passage back to her chateau at Berkenfeld and old Sulpice, sharp as a tack, says, “Hang on a minute, I’ve heard that name before, somewhere, once, over a decade ago, in the heat of a battle, on a letter I found next to the infant Marie though since I apparently can’t read quite how I would recognise the name…” The Marquise – who doesn’t have any children of her own, so far as we’ve noticed, admits that she is Marie’s “aunt”. Oh, and Marie is heir to a tremendous fortune. So Tonio and Marie, eh? Will they? Won’t they? (Does anyone actually give a coq?) And how long till we meet the notaire?Nonsense aside – and, yes, to short-hand the inevitable comparisons, WS Gilbert did indeed do his own re-write of Donizetti’s Francophone foolerie – La Fille du régiment is all good fun and games and no one even comes close to losing an eye. The cast certainly took to it like pigs in mud.Patrizia Ciofi played the tomboyish, thatch-haired Marie like a jack-in-a-box that’d lost its box (although to judge from her curtain call, this is just Ciofi’s natural MO), and threw herself onto people, and against things, and under stuff with all the devil-may-care enthusiasm of her character’s character. Her singing was not quite 100 percent (the lower notes had a tendency to disappear, ending the occasional sentence where it shouldn’t); but I don’t think that was made any the worse for her zeal. She was at her best when messing around in the now-I’m-singing-seriously, now-I’m-basically-a-man-in-a-dress hinterlands.South African tenor Colin Lee was on his third crack at being Swiss Tonio for ROH, and his “oh happy day” big number was as well received as any other solo featuring seven top Cs, with additional plaudits due for the fact that he didn’t try to overcook it. Ann Murray was superbly ridiculous as the traumatised and desperate Marquise de Berkenfeld (especially her alternate straight man/fall guy “singing lessons” with Marie and Sulpice: the singing about singing produced some of the best moments in the opera), and Alan Opie deserves credit for making something out of the Tintin-esque cardboard-cutout sergeant. Donald Maxwell laboured (un)manfully as the infinitely put-upon steward Hortensius.Which leaves us with Ann Widdecombe. The non-singing Duchesse de Crackentorp - the role twice played in this production by Dawn French - is probably the ideal role for the nation’s favourite pantomime battle-axe (and former Shadow Home Secretary), and although Widdy could probably do with less of the “I’m not really an actress, you know” shtick, her Medway-estuary franglais was amusingly (if lengthily) delievered and there were some neat “what the deuce?” kind of moments when she dropped off into English and the supertitles came up in French. The de rigueur up-dated political gags, though, seemed to have been dashed off on the back of a beermat by someone in a terrible hurry. Ian Hislop, perhaps.The supertitling in general had gone with the spirit rather than the letter of the original (""Birkenfield"", as it was repeatedly rendered, sounds like an old people's home in East Sussex); but then it was all of a piece with the balletic cleaning ladies, Marie’s electric iron (no plug), Chantal Thomas’s massively-larger-than-life set, and an opera that in any case gives over chunks of the chorus to that greatest of French onomatopoeia, “rataplan!”Though the house band (under Yves Abel) certainly didn’t take itself too seriously, it is undoubtedly Donizetti’s fault that his opéra comique at times hankers to be both opera and comique. Too many longueurs of the woe-is-me variety take up a good proportion of what is still a fairly short opera, Lee’s last great heart-ache aria, for example, falling very much into this bracket of “almost Caruso-parody, and yet not”. Still, it would be unfair not to admit that, in terms of milking La Fille du régiment for everything she is worth, the directorial staff and singers had made the most of every gag that was put in front of them, and probably a fair few that weren’t.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-fille-du-r%C3%A9giment-royal-opera,4
629,"Jakob Lenz, ENO, Hampstead Theatre",Jakob Lenz,ENO,2012-04-18,alexandra Coghlan,"Forget opera-glasses, the must-have accessory for the contemporary opera-goer in London is fast becoming a sturdy pair of wellingtons. No sooner had we all dried off from our voyage into The Heart of Darkness at the Royal Opera House (where Edward Dick’s watery set lapped dangerously close to the orchestra pit) than we find ourselves up to our knees in the boggy marshlands and treacherous pools of Sam Brown’s Jakob Lenz. The mire of psychological collapse has rarely been so vividly rendered, even on the opera stage (surely madness’s truest artistic home), but while visuals were striking, they were no match for the urgent, immediate drama of Wolfgang Rihm’s 1979 score.Following previous field-trips to the Young Vic, English National Opera here stage their first offsite show at the Hampstead Theatre. While the claustrophobic intimacy of the Young Vic is dramatically attractive (as anyone who saw last year’s The Return of Ulysses will vouch) there’s no getting away from the venue’s acoustic difficulties for classical music. Favouring height over width, Hampstead on the other hand seems a much better fit, offering rather more space for Rihm’s dazzling (in senses both good and bad) orchestration.Harpsichord, percussion and low brass are contorted into a sequence of unexpected colours that beguile and tug at the listener’s attention, emerging out of Brown’s marsh like Will-O’-the-Wisps, luring us to drown in the murky waters of Rihm’s score. The absence of high strings and flutes is striking, creating an aural fog through which we catch lyrical glimpses of cellos and brittle little eruptions of harpsichord.Whether in Nico Muhly’s Two Boys, Bonnie Greer and Errolyn Wallen’s Yes or Judith Weir’s Miss Fortune, we’ve seen an awful lot of resolutely anti-dramatic contemporary opera recently in London, and it is a relief and a thrill to hear a score such as Rihm’s (incisively directed by Alex Ingram) that makes not only a virtue but a necessity of its operatic genre. The harmony is often abrasive, the textures confronting, but always in the service of action, taking up – and amplifying – Lenz’s own ecstatic prose.A poet and playwright, friend of Goethe and frequent admirer of his women, Jacob Lenz was a casualty of German Romanticism – an educated man who tore his own mind apart in the service of the philosophy, art, ethics and social mores of his age. Based on George Buchner’s short story Lenz, the opera traces a brief episode in the poet’s life. Sent to stay with Lutheran Pastor Friedrich Oberlin in the Vosges mountains, where he is tended by both Oberlin himself and fellow writer Christopher Kaufmann, the mad Lenz hallucinates visions of Goethe’s beloved Friederike and attempts suicide.The work of Rihm’s youth (the composer was just 25 when he wrote the opera) Jakob Lenz establishes almost fully-formed the brooding introspection and melancholy that typifies Rihm’s work. It requires a deft director to find shades and textures among so much blackness, and Sam Brown’s production (well-served by Annemarie Woods’ ambitious set) succeeds for the most part. Only the reeds framing the set are problematic. Lack of clarity may be thematically apt and wonderfully suggestive, but with no surtitles to help articulate Richard Stokes’s new translation and much of the action veiled in shrubbery, the work’s more inscrutable moments stand little chance.There’s nothing inscrutable about Andrew Shore’s Lenz, whose madness has the pathos of absolute internal logic and emotional rationale. Taking the character from worldly self-loathing (""I don’t even want to kill myself anymore, it’s too boring”) to raw desperation (his barely-breathed gasp to Oberlin – “Beat me” – is almost unbearable), his acted singing carries us through the technical assault course of the role (never mind the physical assault course of the set) with conviction. This is unquestionably Shore’s show.Support comes however from Richard Robert’s preening Kaufmann, fluting of tone, and also in the gentle gravitas of Jonathan Best’s Oberlin. A brief solo soprano chorus-member Rebecca Van Den Berg (voicing Friederike) is also poised and effective.This is a production that recognises and insists on the theatricality of Rihm’s opera, a natural fit for the exploratory spirit of ENO’s annual escape from the dictates of the Coliseum’s proscenium. Brown’s concept is bold, but occasionally sacrifices clarity for effect; the placing of the ensemble is problematic acoustically, and sight-lines are often deliberately murky. Not a show to stray into unprepared, for those open to Rihm’s caustic language it’s a staging worthy of this contemporary classic. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/jakob-lenz-eno-hampstead-theatre,
630,"Parsifal, Mariinsky Opera/Gergiev, Wales Millennium Centre",Parsifal,Mariinsky Opera/Gergiev,2012-04-01,stephen Walsh,"Is it my imagination, or are we getting more Wagner in concert than we used to? It could be a welcome development. How marvellous not to have to tremble at the thought of the latest flight of directorial fantasy: Isolde pregnant, Siegfried as an airline pilot, the Grail temple transformed into the Reichstag (no prizes for guessing which of these is a real case). Instead you can enjoy what Stravinsky called “the great art of Wagner from the direct source of that greatness and not through the medium of pygmies swarming around the stage”.He had just seen an embargo-busting Parsifal in Monte Carlo in January 1913 (with widow Cosima present) and sat in a side box without sightlines. He would have enjoyed his compatriot Valery Gergiev’s concert performance of that wonderful work with the Mariinsky Opera in Cardiff on Saturday. It was quite devoid of what Wagner came to regard as “deeds of music made visible”, unless you count some vestigial gestures from Kundry and Amfortas, or Klingsor tripping over his chair-leg as he got up to deliver his clinching line at the end of Act II (to his undying credit, he delivered it from the floor). Not a pygmy to be seen; decidedly not – these were Russian opera singers. And very fine at opera-singing, for the most part, they were.Anyone expecting fireworks from Gergiev or, alternatively, the kind of slapdash detailing of his staged Ring here a few years ago was doomed to disappointment. This was a level-headed, well-prepared, if not always immaculately rehearsed reading, complete in every detail, taking few unnecessary risks. A too-quick opening to the second act, and a too-slow prelude to Act III (momentarily sacrificing rhythmic definition) were almost the only eccentricities. Of course, entirely risk-free Wagner is hot ice, a contradiction in terms. The sheer topography of Parsifal is a challenge, what with the onstage brass, Titurel in his underground vault, and the angelic voices from on high. How do you rearrange such perspectives for a concert performance, effectively without a stage?Gergiev perhaps had taken poor advice on these elements, many of which were barely audible, some literally inaudible. In general, though, the balance was good, an issue Wagner took care over, anxious no doubt to make the best possible use of the Bayreuth theatre for which Parsifal was composed. Good to see and hear this often transparent score played by a modest-sized orchestra (only three double-bass desks, four cello desks); and played so beautifully, with ultra-refined string tone and clean, immaculate wind – an innovatory feature that influenced Debussy, and perhaps even Stravinsky himself: a fine pair of supposed Wagner-haters. The electronic bells have to be endured these days, I suppose, odd though they sound in the concert hall (and whoever was throwing the switches miscounted bars at the end of Act I).As for the singing, everything was high-class, short of the unattainable Wagnerian perfection. Larisa Gogolevskaya was one of the strongest Kundrys I can recall – and one recalls too many of them, on the whole. Svelte she isn’t, but her musicianship and control were superb, and the intensity of her performance, notably of course in the long Act II duet with Parsifal, irresistible. She deserved (and made the most of) her gratutious top B at the end of it, and was justly allowed to deliver her two-word singing telegram in the last act (“Dienen, dienen”) from the wings.Like her, Evgeny Nikitin (Amfortas) and Nikolay Putilin (Klingsor) knew their parts and sang them as if they regretted the lack of a stage, a huge virtue in concert performance of opera, which needs, so to speak, to be lifted out of the ambit of oratorio. Yury Vorobiev was a good Gurnemanz but more obviously harnessed to the score – perhaps forgivable with this immense role. Avgust Amonov, a bespectacled, studious-looking, Pierre-Bezhukov sort of Parsifal, came somewhere in-between: rather light of voice and discreet in engagement, but musically likeable, and innocent of the usual Heldentenor barking and yelling.How good these Russian singers are nowadays: hardly a wobble in sight, the musical line respected, and all bang in tune. The flower maidens were no exception, and the Mariinsky chorus, backed up (when audible from offstage) by our own Ex Cathedra, did Cardiff, which knows about choral singing, proud. Their big test, though, comes later today, in Mahler’s Eighth Symphony.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/parsifal-mariinsky-operagergiev-wales-millennium-centre,
631,"Rigoletto, Royal Opera",Rigoletto,Royal Opera,2012-03-31,alexandra Coghlan,"David McVicar’s Rigoletto hurls full-frontal nudity and an orgy at the audience within its opening minutes – dramatic grenades to clear the well-worn ground ahead. Back in 2001 this may have been enough to shock-and-awe, but a decade and a couple of revivals on and it takes rather more. And more we certainly get in the current revival. Not only does Italian superstar tenor Vittorio Grigolo take his turn in the Duke’s tight britches, but John Eliot Gardiner takes charge in the pit for this, his first Rigoletto. With Dimitri Platanias also making his Royal Opera debut in the title role, there’s a lot going on here – too much, at times.As artistic battles of wills go it would be hard to imagine a tougher pair of adversaries than Gardiner and Grigolo. Gardiner’s rigorous precision, the unfussy directness of his musical lines and his lack of anything approaching indulgence is as familiar as Grigolo’s own rather more Italianate approach. Cossetting and coaxing every phrase, his is a voice that luxuriates in its own power, checking itself out in the mirror of his adoring public (cheering and applauding last night after almost every number). There’s no denying the quality of his instrument, nor its power, but his musical approach as yet lacks the flexibility to fit into all ensembles.And so it was here. While Gardiner pushed forward, chivvying the Royal Opera House Orchestra into crisp, brisk little gestures, Grigolo slumped gracefully into his arias, refusing to be hurried or to make any concession to stylistic compromise. His gleaming brightness of tone and sheer volume reduced everyone else on stage to black and white, leaving Grigolo alone as the colourful foreground. It wasn’t the most generous of singing, and while “Questa o quella” and “La donna e mobile” – the young Duke’s smug expressions of his own position and power – fitted neatly into his scheme, petulance was never quite absent from his transformative moments, undermining the plausibility of Ekaterina Siurina’s swift seduction.Siurina is no match for Grigolo (pictured right) in terms of vocal weight, but musically much more alert to the ensemble around her. Spinning some beautifully controlled pianissimos in “V’ho ingannato”, hers is a poised performance that as yet still lacks the final gear of power for the dramatic climaxes. Christine Rice feels criminally underused as Maddalena, but acquits herself with characteristic style – a lovely earthy foil to Siurina’s delicate soprano.All ears however were on Greek baritone Dimitri Platanias (pictured below), making his first appearance at the Royal Opera House. Physically as solid as his voice, he cuts an unusually youthful and sturdy figure in the role of Rigoletto, despite McVicar’s best attempts to weaken him with two walking sticks. His evident physical power rather undermines the pathos of proceedings, unbalancing the power dynamic even in the face of Grigolo’s overwhelmingly virile Duke.Vocally we see something of the same problem; beautifully even through the range and strong at the extremes, his is a quality baritone, but lacks character and sensitivity in the delivery. If Grigolo was guilty of fussing over every nuance, of curving every melodic straight line, then Platanias suffered the opposite. Interior moments – his discovery of Gilda in Act III, his stealthy confrontation with the kidnappers – risked baldness, so impersonal were they. As to dramatic arc or character, perhaps it was his awkwardly armadillo-like armour, but little attempt at either of these was able to penetrate out and reach the audience.Gardiner may be best-known as a period specialist, but he is by no means new to the later repertoire. It’s too easy an argument to see the Baroque textures at work here, but it is perhaps the only explanation for the rather bloodless rendition we got last night. Bringing unexpected clarity to Verdi’s chamber textures (moments for oboe and cello during Rigoletto’s plea for the return of Gilda, and some beautiful orchestral characterisation during Rigoletto’s first encounter with Sparafucile), his climaxes however lacked momentum and weight. And the less said about the mess the Royal Opera’s brass section made of the lowering opening (here was unease of quite the wrong kind), or the battle of tempos between chorus and offstage band, the better.McVicar’s production is a characteristic mash-up of medieval and contemporary elements, and, judging by the creaking of the revolve, is getting as tired physically as it is beginning to look visually. There’s just too much fuss here, both dramatically and in the competing musical accounts of the opera offered by Gardiner and his cast. Amongst it all Verdi’s tragedy is all but lost.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/rigoletto-royal-opera,
632,"Riccardo Primo, Britten Theatre, Royal College of Music",Riccardo Primo,Britten Theatre,2012-03-28,alexandra Coghlan,"No greater proof of the potency of the current Handel revival can be found than the London Handel Festival, now in its 35th year. The festival continues to fill concert halls and churches across London every Spring with the composer’s chamber repertoire, but it is the annual opera that remains unquestionably the main event. No matter how abstruse the choice (and this year’s Riccardo Primo – unperformed in London for some 20 years – is surely as unfamiliar as it gets) audiences return, lured by the energy of the festival’s Musical Director Laurence Cummings, and his cast of young singers from the Royal College of Music.Completed in 1727, the unusual and stridently nationalistic elements of Riccardo Primo are only partially explained by the accession of George II. The composer himself also had particular cause to celebrate his adopted homeland, which had granted him citizenship earlier that year. The resulting opera is undeniably celebratory, bright with festal brass and woodwind and peopled with kings and princesses. But while Riccardo Primo’s sentiments are beyond reproach, the same cannot alas be said for the libretto, nor even the score.While Handel’s music lacks the structural invention and characterisation that we find in his later work, it is solid enough, with a couple of stand-out arias including Costanza’s “Il volo così” with its birdlike recorder obbligato, Riccardo’s atheletic “All’orror delle”, and villain Isacio’s “Nel mondo nel abisso”. A serviceable score frames a plot however whose skeleton is contorted beyond the endurance of even seasoned baroque enthusiasts. Mistaken identities, kingly quarrels, love denied, lovers reunited – all these shape a work whose characters lack the substance to carry such emotional and dramatic extremes.A shipwreck separates Richard the Lionheart from Princess Costanza of Navarre – the betrothed he has never met. She finds herself at the mercy of Cypriot tyrant Isacio and his daughter Pulcheria. Struck by her charms, Isacio schemes to send his own daughter to wed Richard and to marry Costanza (Eleanor Dennis, pictured right with Timothy Nelson as Berardo) himself. Wars are declared, schemes thwarted, and Richard ends up not only with the love of his allotted bride, but also the eternal “friendship” of the winsome Pulcheria, now queen of Cyprus.Opting for a traditional (eighteenth century) setting, complete with splendidly anachronistic armour, designer Adam Wiltshire offers some gorgeous stage pictures – with Pulcheria’s jasmine-wreathed salon a fragrant highlight. The many video projections however sit awkwardly with the action – a necessary convenience rather than an artistic choice, and especially in the case of one apparently hijacked by David Attenborough, represent a major misstep on the part of director James Robert Carson.Direction is a problem throughout. Content for the most part to espouse a rather stolid 1980s approach, with little activity to enliven or inform the da capos, Carson suddenly chooses to subvert the lieto fine dramatically. The result is both unexpected and unclear, and adds too little complexity too late to his cardboard heroes and heroines.Cummings’ orchestra are all guttural punch and swaggering dance, and the trumpets, oboes, recorders and flute add welcome dimension and colour to the action – kept mercifully efficient by Cummings’ tempos. The cast are a rather more mixed affair however, not quite equalling the quality recently on offer.Regular festival-goers will be delighted at the return of Eleanor Dennis as Costanza. Her tone only seems to grow in colour and depth, offering welcome light and shade to the rather unremitting gloom of her character. It’s not a role of particular virtuosity, but the occasional glimpses are enough to remind us what this talented young soprano is capable of.While the audience seemed delighted with Emilie Renard’s Pulcheria, whose charm is undeniable, her vocal quality is a little less secure. After a rather thin start she warmed up into the role, but the support came and went throughout the evening, a problem also for Fiona Mackenzie’s Oronte.Both Rupert Enticknap’s Riccardo (pictured left) and Edward Grint’s Isacio were technically secure (though on the evidence of previous years I’d have been eager to hear Cast B’s Jake Arditti in the role of Riccardo). Enticknap felt a little ill at ease with the low-riding register of the role, struggling to project at times, but dispatched most of the coloratura with control. Grint clearly has more to offer than the role permitted, but relished playing the villain, and his “Nel mondo, nel abisso” was a delight.Whether the fault of direction or the weaknesses of the work itself, Riccardo Primo lacks the sheen of previous Handel Festival productions. Doubtless it will settle into the run, and as a rare opportunity to see this jingoistic curiosity of an opera it should be seized, but I for one am hoping that La Nuova Musica’s Il Pastor Fido next month delivers the goods that 2012’s main opera couldn’t quite produce.Riccardo Primo is at the Britten Theatre, Royal College of Music until 29 March",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/riccardo-primo-britten-theatre-royal-college-music,
633,"Miss Fortune, Royal Opera",Miss Fortune,Royal Opera,2012-03-13,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"I find it hard to square what I know about composer Judith Weir with what happened last night. In one corner lies her 30-year output of songs, choral pieces and operas - as engaging and beguiling an oeuvre as that of any living composer's. I think of her waggish song cycle King Harald's Saga or her playful opera A Night at the Chinese Opera. And then I think of the UK premiere of Miss Fortune at the Royal Opera last night - the inertness of the music, the superficiality of the story, the platitudes and, most bafflingly, the racism - and I wonder, what has happened to Judith Weir?If one was to apply the wisdom of this opera, one would put the qualitative slippage down to Fate. That's who's to blame when things go belly up for the eponymous heroine of the opera, Miss Fortune. Why, she seems to cry at the end of Act One, have these six breakdancing black hoodlums wrecked the factory I was so happily working in? Because, Judith Weir's opera muses, shit happens. Fortunes rise. Fortunes fall. Kebab vans rise. Kebab vans fall. Laundrettes rise. Laundrettes fall. She might have extended the logic to herself: composers rise; composers fall.This work sees Weir in full compositional freefall. All the characteristic Weir-ian traits - harmonic clarity, melodic and rhythmic accessibility, and folkloric fixations - are here but in bathetic parody. Her libretto (which suggests that life is like a ""roller-coaster"") must shoulder much of the flak, but so too must her music. None of the many musical references (especially those to Stravinsky's Rake's Progress, to which the opera bears an unflattering resemblance) are convincingly integrated into a larger, more distinct language. Her thematic interests are limited. Her rhythmic and percussion writing - often sluggishly handled by conductor Paul Daniel - is frequently embarrassing.The garish production from director Chen Shi-Zheng confuses both mind and eye with its abstract floating shapes and neon strips. Worse, attempts to inject life into the lifeless installation through the introduction of six breakdancers descends into jaw-dropping racial typecasting. As Miss Fortune sings of entering the ""shadows"" and ""dark streets"" of the real world, she's set upon by six representatives of this rough shadowy place, a gang of bopping black thugs, who go on to destroy the factory she's working for and torch a kebab van she finds herself taking shelter in. Only in opera could ethnic street dancing still so shamelessly be used to connote criminality.Then again, so much of this opera proceeds as if the Enlightenment never happened that this bout of racism was hardly a surprise. The night offers no psychological development. There's no interior life to the characters. Everything proceeds according to Fate's decree. That's all well and good for a carefully constructed fairy tale, in which there is layer upon layer of meaning and echo, subtext and allusion. But Weir's Miss Fortune is one of the most literal-minded folk tales ever to see the light of day. Character is pushed and pulled by the mundanity of the plot and the metaphysical messiness of the costumes and the staging and, as a result, rendered vague and one-dimensional. One of the most baffling roles, the smarmy city boy Simon (excellently sung by Jacques Imbrailo), barely gains even half a dimension in his few moments of small talk with the launderette owner, Donna (a decent Anne-Marie Owens). Yet somehow we're meant to understand and perhaps feel something when he, in the end, wins the girl. Beats me as to how.Emma Bell (Miss Fortune) makes a decent fist of her maddeningly ill-defined lead role (she seemed as confused as us by what's going on). Some curtain-call slapstick between the bickering Lady and Lord Fortune (Kathryn Harries and Alan Ewing) hinted at what the opera was underneath its earnest veneer: panto. Had we had a little more he's-behind-you, and a bit less in-the-end-we'll-all-be-dead, it might have trundled along with a little more charm. As it was, Miss Fortune came across as one big, expensive mistake.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/miss-fortune-royal-opera,
634,"A Midsummer Night's Dream, Barbican Theatre",A Midsummer Night's Dream,Barbican Theatre,2012-02-29,alexandra Coghlan,"Love it or hate it Christopher Alden’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream at English National Opera last year made quite the impact, banishing any fey woodland glades and general waftiness from Benjamin Britten’s opera and embracing a rather more astringent visual aesthetic. It’s unfortunate then that Martin Lloyd-Evans’s production for the Guildhall School of Music and Drama should follow so closely behind, begging comparisons that don’t best serve his World War II interpretation. A lack of directorial coherence mars what visually and vocally is a fine evening, and while Shakespeare may restore order to his young lovers, Lloyd-Evans ultimately leaves his audience wandering (and wondering) in his enchanted forest.Britten’s eerie glissandi break the silence in a moonlit hospital ward or dormitory, rows of beds concealing children. As dirty and dishevelled as the room itself, these feral fairies in nightgowns and slippers orchestrate the action with the help of Puck (Alexander Knox). In what seems (nothing is clear here, and not in a good way) to be a collective playing-out of escapist fantasy, the children dream their way out of their squalor while Puck himself, initially elderly and wheelchair-bound, casts aside his disability and regains his youth.  The quartet of lovers come clad in assorted service uniforms, while Oberon (Tom Verney) and Tytania (Eleanor Laugharne, pictured below) appear respectively as kinky surgeon (Oberon sports a rather fetching pair or leather trousers together with matching leather apron and gloves) and kinky matron (or possibly kinky nun – it’s hard to tell). The mechanicals fit into Lloyd-Evans scheme most naturally, with Quince (James Platt) heading up his plausibly motley collections of Home Guard volunteers.There’s no shortage of ideas here, and while Dick Bird’s beautiful designs gamely pursue each one, conjuring flying beds and a rustic milk-float stage for Bottom et al, and bringing not only fairy-lights and bunting but an entire forest down from the sky, no amount of visual magic can distract from direction that lacks focus or any plan for his wartime setting other than some attractive visuals.It’s a lack that shows up the weaker actors of the cast. While there’s a place for motiveless malignancy in Shakespeare it certainly isn’t here, and despite stalking the stage like an extra from Saw, Verney’s villainous Oberon is strikingly lacking in character. Denied any relationship (amorous or otherwise) with matron Tytania, and with the “little Indian boy” all but absent, his campaign of mischief has little purpose and still less clarity. Vocally it’s a big ask for a young countertenor (particularly in a large space like the Barbican’s theatre) and while Verney’s diction and voice are both solid, we miss the magic only real legato can bring to “I know a bank” and the otherworldly menace Britten’s celesta insists so emphatically upon. Laugharne’s Tytania is assured and queenly – the stand-out vocal performance of the evening – controlling a rather heavier voice than Britten’s writing suggests with absolute musicality. Among a universally strong quartet of lovers Sky Ingram’s passionate Helena (pictured below with Ashley Riches and Stuart Laing) and Riches’s Demetrius draw eye and ear, and there’s strong work also from Barnaby Rea as Bottom (alternating each performance with Ciprian Droma’s Theseus). While Rea delights in his comedy without ever sacrificing tone colour and phrasing, perhaps his fellow mechanicals might have taken more risks however; smaller roles like Flute (Jorge Navarro-Colorado) Snout (Luis Gomes) and Starveling (Hadleigh Adams) needed more character-singing and less vocal loveliness to bring energy to their knockabout scenes.On the whole the pace did drag, and not even the excellent ensemble singing of the fairy chorus could redeem the directionless and dissonant work from the orchestra under Stephen Barlow. Britten’s evocative opening was lost in tentative scratchings, capturing the eeriness but none of the lush delights of this deviant forest of the night. At times too loud (a little more sympathy to Verney’s lower register might not have gone amiss) and at others crucially absent (the Act III lovers’ quartet needed much more support to make harmonic sense) the orchestra consistently hampered the singers – a real shame given their quality.When Martin Lloyd-Evans’s production lost its fairies it also lost something of Shakespeare’s magic. Alden has flung the door wide for intelligent, resonant reworkings, but if a change of setting does nothing more than exchange crinolines for gas-masks then it hardly seems worth the trouble. There’s a comedy of mistaken identities here, but it’s not quite the one Britten had in mind.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/midsummer-nights-dream-barbican-theatre,
635,"Rusalka, Royal Opera House",Rusalka,Royal Opera House,2012-02-28,Geoff Brown,"Why has the Royal Opera not staged Dvořák’s Rusalka before now? I know there have been plausible distractions: the lock grip of Italian repertoire, fear of singing Czech, fixation with Dvořák as an instrumental composer, two world wars, a shortage of good water nymphs. But Sadler’s Wells gave the British premiere of this musically sumptuous ""lyric fairytale"" (its official description) as long ago as 1959. Since then the Little Mermaid­-ish drama of the water nymph longing for human love has visited English National Opera, Glyndebourne, Opera North, Grange Park, Wexford; I could go on. Even now, Covent Garden hasn’t thought from scratch but arranged for a production to be shipped in, from the 2008 Salzburg Festival, where it caused a kerfuffle of boos and applause.It did the same here last night. The original directors Jossi Wieler and Sergio Morabito, designer Barbara Ehnes, and the revival director Samantha Seymour have served up a lamentable farrago, topped by a gallimaufry of sets and props that could have been dragged in from Covent Garden by a cat. A bordello’s tarty curtains and red vinyl couch, pink neon lights and crucifix, big wooden slats, fish swimming in video projections; I could go on. Talking of cats, we get three of them, all black: one a stuffed toy, odd recipient of the opera’s big hit, the heroine’s Song to the Moon; one a performer grotesquely costumed, who claws at Rusalka’s plastic mermaid tail, then mounts her for jiggery-pokery; one a real cat, Girlie by name, who briefly curls on a sofa in Act Three before stalking off. Add to all this three wood nymphs primed for Saturday night bingeing, and other assorted clobber from directors who have raided Slavic mythology, Freud, and the post-modern tool kit without being able to integrate their haul in the opera they’re supposed to be staging.Still, let’s look on the bright side, which means for the most part looking into the orchestra pit. This is Yannick Nézet-Séguin’s Covent Garden debut, and it’s a triumph. Rusalka has always been a lovely score, but Nézet-Séguin wills the Royal Opera House Orchestra to deliver its beauties with an extra kiss of sensuousness, extra jabs of drama. Bucolic woodwinds burble, limpid harps ripple, Wagnerian chromaticisms slither in the brass: every detail shimmers with passion. No wonder someone yelled out Nézet-Séguin’s name after the last act’s introductory applause.Camilla Nylund, Salzburg’s Rusalka, is another house newcomer. Her soprano’s white tones entirely suit a character referred to as ""pale Rusalka"", who dresses in Act Two in bridal whites, outcast ghost at the Prince’s feast. But with that whiteness come insufficient decibels for reaching over the orchestra, where most of the pleasures in Song of the Moon reside. Bryan Hymel’s lyric tenor projects the erring Prince’s anguish fairly well, though he reaches for some top notes as you might for an apple dangling on a branch just beyond your arm. The biggest vocal satisfaction is offered by Alan Held’s water goblin Vodník (pictured above right with Nylund) – warning and admonishing throughout with comfortable resonance and considerable feeling. Petra Lang, flirty in pearls, enjoys herself as the Foreign Princess, though her diction could be crisper. Vivid if erratic impressions are also left by Agnes Zwierko’s slatternly witch Ježibaba, and the wood nymph gaggle (Anna Devin, Madeleine Pierard, Justina Gringyte) whose close harmony goes some way to alleviate the dramatic idling in Act Three.In Wieler and Morabito’s mess it’s Act Two, in the Prince’s castle, that works the best: the tightest in focus, less overrun with silliness, glued together by Rusalka’s travails as she’s passed around like a rag doll, awkward and forlorn.  This is touching: this means something.  For the rest, you sigh or roll your eyes. Rusalka, finally on the Covent Garden stage, deserves better. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/rusalka-royal-opera-house,
636,"The Death of Klinghoffer, English National Opera",The Death of Klinghoffer,English National Opera,2012-02-26,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"In October 1985 four Palestinian terrorists boarded the Achille Lauro cruise liner, took the 400-odd passengers hostage, shot an old disabled American Jew dead and flung his body overboard. Of all the many atrocities in the long war between the Palestinians and Israelis the murder of Leon Klinghoffer has always struck me as being one of the more morally cut and dried incidents. Hardly worthy of any kind of lengthy debate, let alone dramatic exposition. But the successful trio behind Nixon in China (Peter Sellars, Alice Goodman and John Adams) thought differently and proceeded to turn the cold-blooded killing into a opera.Much of the critical reaction to the premiere of The Death of Klinghoffer in 1991 was angrily unfavourable. Reviewers accused the trio of anti-Semitism, of cashing in on others' pain, of romanticising terrorism and of anti-bourgeois laziness. The work was labelled controversial and offensive. Last night it received its London debut. Controversial? Offensive? Not half as much as many have claimed. Certainly few of the main political objections stand up to any scrutiny. You'd have to be very literal-minded to consider the work anti-Semitic, for example. Klinghoffer might contain anti-Semitic lines (""wherever poor men are gathered you can ﬁnd Jews getting fat""; ""America is one big Jew"" etc). But these are delivered by Palestinian terrorists. And Palestinian terrorists tend, on the whole, to be anti-Semitic. It kind of comes with the job.Neither are the four fanatics romanticised. At least not in last night's Tom Morris production. Rather, the hijackers were characterised as a brutish, shrill lot with very little humanity and absurd ideals. There is one aria by Mamoud (sung with perhaps a little too much English enunciation by Richard Burkhard) which was perhaps meant to make us think this guy's got depth. But the aria is so weighed down by its long, tedious bird metaphor that the brain dozes off before one ever gets to questions of Mamoud's morality. One just thinks: what a boring, pretentious loser.The others terrorists are given a monochromatic, strident musical language and deliver so much thuggish blocking that, even if you weren't inclined to at first, you're soon forced to side with the Klinghoffers. The Palestinian chorus is no less nauseating; these are people full of violent and unreasonable thoughts (""Let the supplanter look upon his work / Our faith will take the stones he broke / And break his teeth""). In fact, compared to the admirably brave and sympathetic stand from Leon Klinghoffer (the excellent Alan Opie) and moving eloquence of his wife, Marilyn (Michaela Martens), the Palestinians are given a singularly brutish role - not undeserved.Far more offence should have been felt by the maligned troupe of British dancers stationed on the ship, who are represented in the opera by a total air-head (Kate Miller-Heidke) who recollects the whole hijacking (utterly implausibly) in one big giggle. (And if you didn't get the point, her music bubbles up from flutter-tonguing brass and woodwind with a lightness and fizziness that is a clear echo of her feeble mind.) Neither she nor Christopher Magiera's Captain - both of whom represent a strand of insensitive lower-middle class doltishness that Adams and Goodman clearly loathe more than anything else - hit upon believable realisations. Naturally, lazy political thinking frames the work. Palestinian savagery, for example, is blamed on the 1948 exile of Palestinians (overlooking the fact that this was self-inflicted). The concrete slabs of the West Bank barrier (which has done more to make peace possible than any other single thing) looms ominously as a backdrop, blocking and caging characters at various times. None of this represents anything more than a depressing reflection of the well-intentioned but badly misinformed consensus of the politically ignorant artistic classes. There were only two things in this production that were truly offensive: the direction and the music. Most offensive was the idea that this thin score was John Adams's finest to date. Finer than Nixon in China? Doctor Atomic? What an insult. The truth is that Adams did not have a happy compositional time in the early 1990s. Attempting to shift his block-like early Postminimalist language towards something more conducive to the kind of Romantic opera he wanted to write was not easy. In Klinghoffer he finds himself embarrassingly marooned between the two musical worlds, trying to square the mutually incompatible ideas of the post-minimalist chug with the Romantic concept of development. Inspiration fails him again and again in the orchestral writing. As does taste. Even in 1991 no one thought the electronic synthesiser a serious instrument. There were enormous problems with pacing in the first half and precision from conductor Baldur Brönnimann in the second.Tom Morris's staging, on the other hand, at least began well. The exiled Palestinian chorus undressed to become the exiled Jewish chorus. Neat. Even the fatuous political statement that was the wall backdrop had one advantage of adding an attractive grainy texture to the photography and videography (Fin Ross) that was projected onto it. But with the entry of the Achille Lauro and the sudden demand to juggle two storylines and a spiritual undercurrent, Morris lost all clarity of purpose and never regained it. Thank God, then, for Marilyn Klinghoffer's final aria, a powerful, righteous and long overdue howl of rage from the excellent Michaela Martens that rescued the entire evening. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/death-klinghoffer-english-national-opera,
637,"La Clemenza di Tito, Barbican Hall",La Clemenza di Tito,Barbican Hall,2012-02-25,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"To Charles Rosen it was a work of ""rarely redeemed dullness"". The wife of Emperor Leopold called it ""German rubbish"". It's pretty obvious why so many have objected to Mozart's final opera La clemenza di Tito. Tunes (memorable ones) are by and large lacking, which is odd for Mozart. The overture is not something you'd want to hear on its own. And the work's great solo arias are unwieldy in form (though fascinatingly so) and tricky to sing and separated by the vast wastes of a notorious recitative. Yet for me what the work lacks, it more than makes up for in dramatic clarity and economy, musical variety and formal inventiveness.The visiting Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen and their attendant singers made us completely forget the possible flaws in their Barbican Hall concert performance. A clarity of conception and expression flowed directly from the conductor Louis Langrée. He knew exactly what he wanted: clean lines, a driving momentum and drama. The overture, shifting its weight from strings to woodwind with well-articulated bounce and brightness, carried its perkiness straight through into the muggy court histrionics of the opening scene. What a beautifully cast lot the leads were. Not just vocally but also in terms of character. Each fitted their courtiers' psychologies like a glove. Malin Hartelius's troubled, scheming Vitellia delivered her Machiavellianism through both a fiery voice and bony, anxious gesturing. There was a particularly brilliant moment near the end of the first act where Vitellia finds out that her plotting has got out of hand and is about to bite her very nastily on the bum. At this dramatic turn, the vocal line reaches up beyond where Hartelius's voice will go. But instead of freezing and croaking, the soprano projected her vocal difficulties onto her character, hammed herself up - crossing her eyes and curling her lips - and made it all part of her end-of-act collapse.Her accomplice, the conflicted courtier Sesto, was equally well assigned to a frighteningly male Alice Coote. Coote's voice - so rich and thick - was able both to wallow inactively like Hamlet and also to spring into Bin Laden-like acts of terror. Matching her musical flexibility in the celebrated aria Parto, parto, ma tu, ben mio was the balletic basset clarinet of Matthew Hunt. Coote spun her long, clarinet-stalked song outward from its still centre with thrilling centrifugal energy. Michael Schade was the ideal enlightened Emperor, his effete, insouciant way allowing him to stumble through the opera with convincing cluelessness. So laid back, in fact, did Schade's Emperor become that he nearly came a cropper in his spurt of coloratura in Act Two. The old pro kept calm, however, and ended up hitting every last semi-quaver on the nose.The vocal talent didn't stop at the leads. Christina Daletska's trembly little Annius was terrifically pretty. Brindley Sherratt's Publius was a wonder of firm, well-projected and clear bass singing. And just as you thought you'd seen the best of the vocal soloists, up popped Rosa Feola's Servilia; her short but impassioned Act Two aria had the audience swooning. Thankfully all three were given more than the musical scraps to sing. One of the great blessings of Clemenza are the duets and trios, which contain a wealth of interesting musical material. Underpinning all this characterful court intrigue is eccentric orchestral activity and tonal instability. The choruses get some of the best of this in their bookend interruptions. The Deutscher Kammerchor never shied away from pointing up the musical subsidence. And neither did Langrée. But dramatic energy was his focus. And he and his extremely alert orchestra kept up such a fantastic momentum - especially in the much-derided recitative - that it was harder than ever to understand the beef that Rosen and his many eminent fellow carpers have, in the past, had with the work.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-clemenza-di-tito-barbican-hall,
638,"Beatrice and Benedict, Welsh National Opera",Beatrice and Benedict,Welsh National Opera,2012-02-18,stephen Walsh,"Such a pity about Beatrice and Benedict! As a musical visualiser, a creator of musical tableaux, a radio composer avant la lettre, Berlioz had few equals. The Damnation of Faust is surely the greatest radio opera ever written. But for some reason he had no grasp of the stage. Benvenuto Cellini is a lifeless succession of spectacular tableaux. The Trojans must have more superb music per square yard of ineffective drama than any work of comparable length.As for Berlioz’s singing-telegram version of Much Ado About Nothing, it would have merited that title all too well if Berlioz had risked it. As it is, the one he chose tells us precisely what the work is not about, which I suppose is a triumph of sorts. The real heroine is, aptly enough, Hero. She has the biggest solo and the major part in the two big female ensembles. Yet her lover, Claudio (almost her sole topic of conversation) sings nothing except a small part in one trio, and is otherwise passive or absent.The nominal hero and heroine discover and discuss their love in spoken dialogue, and have nothing approaching a love duet. Beatrice hardly sings in Act 1, Benedict hardly in Act 2. And so on. Almost every dramatic (as opposed to musical) decision is a mistake. Somehow WNO’s revival of their now quite antiquated Elijah Moshinsky production gets round this with a lovely, exquisitely lit Renaissance-arcade set by Michael Yeargan (lighting by Howard Harrison), some witty stage business, especially for the musician Somarone (brilliantly farced up by Donald Maxwell), and well-posed tableaux vivants, which accept the beauty of Berlioz’s inspiration while acknowledging his dramaturgic frailty.WNO do make some mistakes of their own, it’s true. I can see why they play Beatrice in Geoffrey Dunn’s skilful English, not least for the jokes; but the invitation to regret the absence of Shakespeare’s sparkling barrage of repartee in the presence of odd fragments of it is altogether too glaring. Much better, surely, go French and hang the comprehension (Maxwell, at least, would be funny in any language).But the main risks are musical ones, and not all of them come off. Somarone’s send-up of a bad village choir, wonderfully exaggerated, and perhaps too well corrected second time through, is a little near the bone when the pit orchestra also has its rough patches of wind intonation and the stage choir, usually peerless with this company, has moments of untypical coarseness. Berlioz called this last opera of his “a caprice written with the point of a needle”, but it needs playing of equivalent refinement. Here, under Michael Hofstetter, the needle-point is blunted by careless balance, with high woodwind and brass stepping too enthusiastically into the spotlight. On the other hand, Hofstetter’s pacing of music so quicksilver subtle in its movement and texture is mostly excellent: not his fault that every five minutes or so the music has to stop at the traffic lights of stodgy, semi-Shakespearean dialogue.The cast looks strong on paper, sometimes struggles with Berlioz’s gaucheries in practice. Laura Mitchell (pictured above) has moments of real splendour in Hero’s extraordinary Act 1 aria with its huge written-out cadenza (what did Berlioz think he was writing?), and the poised beauty of her “Nuit paisible et sereine!” duet with the dark-toned Ursula of Anna Burford ends the act on a high musical note, though at times, in this big arena, the voice forces a touch and perhaps lacks the last measure of warmth.Sara Fulgoni’s Beatrice – repeated, as she may not care to be reminded, from the original production of 1994 – is commanding when Berlioz allows, which is essentially only once, in her lovely second act aria, a Gluckian scena that has precious little to do with the character but is incomparable as a set piece.Robin Tritschler’s lank-haired Benedict – allegedly but inaudibly becolded on the first night – has a lovely delicacy of tone and mobility, but lacks snap to go with a character who, until his too easy conversion to sentimental lover, is all crackle. No one else gets much chance to sing anything worthwhile, but they all have a go at talking what amounts to badly remembered Shakespeare. Not surprisingly, the success rate varies.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/beatrice-and-benedict-welsh-national-opera,
639,"Le nozze di Figaro, Royal Opera",Le nozze di Figaro,Royal Opera,2012-02-13,David Benedict,"When blithe Susanna and not the expected Cherubino emerges from hiding before the astonished Countess and enraged Count, the latter instantly back-pedals on the fury he has been heaping upon his seemingly faithless wife. She rounds on him: “Crudele, più quella non sono!” (“Traitor, I am no longer her”) and everything suddenly stops. It's a tiny two-beat rest that usually goes for nothing except the signal for a key change, but here the moment is charged with drama. The Count shoots apologetic looks to cover his shame and the Countess painfully registers her lost trust. That vivid attention to musical and dramatic detail is thrillingly typical of this first-rate production.With a score and libretto as precise as this – I’d argue it’s the finest in the entire operatic repertoire – it’s depressing how generalised many Figaros turn out to be. But from its first outing in 2006 (available on DVD), attention to detail was the hallmark of David McVicar’s Royal Opera production. Not all its subsequent outings have been as happy, but this new incarnation, directed by Leah Hausman and conducted by Antonio Pappano, really is a revival in every sense.Much of the excitement comes via the new casting. As the Countess, bold-voiced Rachel Willis-Sørensen makes an outstanding debut. The idea that a phrase repeated should grow in meaning is hardly radical, but it’s thrilling nevertheless to hear someone who understands the dramatic potential of “Dove sono”. Instead of delivering a neatly subdued portrait of all-purpose regret, Willis-Sørensen holds on to an ever-deepening ache in the aria that leads her to deliver the da capo section with upsetting intensity.She’s more than matched by Lucas Meachem’s Count. His voice may not be the largest but it’s truly lustrous. It’s immensely characterful and flexible and he really knows how to use it. At full throttle it's darkly threatening and even when he tosses off an extra trill at the top it’s in service of his character.Winningly, he’s also physically relaxed on stage which lends him natural authority. With the Count’s nemesis Cherubino cropping up everywhere, baritones usually resort to “furious” acting that, paradoxically, makes them look weak. But Meachem’s bullying is dangerously nasty because rather than blustering, he‘s calm. As a result, his final, exquisitely hushed “perdono” – his climactic plea for forgiveness – is deeply moving.Among the returnees, Ildebrando d’Arcangelo is a nicely swaggering Figaro who more than stands his ground. In “Non più andrai” he hurls the idea of an end to philandering directly at the Count rather than at Cherubino. And there’s a real sense of a relationship as he cavorts with his Susanna (Aleksandra Kurzak). The latter’s coloratura range means she, too, is vocally relaxed. Yet although her adroit, spirited performance is on the money, it borders on the pert with a faint sense that it’s ever so slightly off-the-peg for her.There is strength right through the cast, not least in Ann Murray who doesn’t miss a trick as a notably pinched Marcellina who proves that, despite appearances, she’s actually up for a tumble in the sheets with Bartolo. Her performance is enough to make you wish her traditionally cut Act IV aria could be reinstated. Pappano, however, has his eye on the flow.Faced with Mozart's box of delights, many conductors get sidetracked into wallowing. Not Pappano. Great temptations like blasting the shiver-inducing bottom C in the Act II quartet are resisted in favour of keeping the momentum going and his tempi are as finely judged dramatically as they are musically.  Downton Abbey famously teaches us that all masters are generously understanding of those who serve them. Mercifully, this production’s brilliantly delineated status of every single member of an utterly convincing household corrects such propaganda. Bathed in the intense heat of Paule Constable’s daylight slipping inexorably into night, the entire company presents a reminder, in the subtlest of ways, of the revolutionary nature of this masterpiece.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/le-nozze-di-figaro-royal-opera-house-0,
640,"La Traviata, Welsh National Opera",La Traviata,Welsh National Opera,2012-02-12,stephen Walsh,"Famously, at its Venice premiere in 1853, La traviata had trouble with the censor, not only over the salty innuendos of the plot, but over the simple fact that it was set in the present day and in contemporary costume. A rule like that would finish off most updated modern stagings (and no bad thing at that). But David McVicar’s now two-year-old staging of Verdi’s early verismo masterpiece in Cardiff's Wales Millennium Centre wouldn’t be one of them.With a few tweaks, and maybe a mild slippage forward of a decade or two, it takes the work’s demi-monde as it finds it, bustles and white ties and all, furnishes it in Empire style, drapes it in expensive curtainings (designer Tanya McCallin), and lights it (Jennifer Tipton) in a glowing mist of reds and mauves and oranges. The ugliness and degradation of high-class promiscuity, all this might be telling us, needs to hide behind a veneer of expensive beauty, just as death lurks behind the pretence of vitality. As for love, that’s an entirely unexpected guest at such festivities and is certain to be misunderstood, although – and this is the final tragic twist of Dumas’s original tale – it would make no difference. Death would win anyway.It’s a pity to have to labour the point, but McVicar’s production demonstrates that it’s still perfectly possible to stage a mainstream realist opera in a stylish, non-ironic manner for a sophisticated audience without betraying (in either sense) your secret desire that all this operatic tosh should be sent to the devil ASAP. Like all Verdi, La traviata needs top-class singing. But unlike some, it also requires precise, psychologically informed acting, which is still not necessarily a priority with your average Italian opera star.McVicar is fortunate in this revival in having a young Canadian soprano, Joyce El-Khoury (pictured right), making her European début, who can not only get round Verdi’s coloratura but knows how to move, knows how to stand still, and knows how to react. As a singer she is decidedly interesting, if not yet completely formed. The voice, superbly controlled in the difficult soft lights of the final act, still sometimes lacks warmth in the lower registers, and can occasionally sound frail under pressure. Her “Ah, fors’é lui” was deliciously touching (and how cleverly she conveyed the anxiety of this sudden discovery of a genuine emotion); “Sempre libera” needed, perhaps, more body, if not more conviction – Violetta is, after all, fooling herself about keeping her freedom.On the other hand, she paced her scene with Germont to perfection, and found a marvellous inwardness at that great moment at Flora’s where, amid the accusations and counter-accusations, poor Violetta can only beg heaven to release her: “What to do? I feel I’m dying! Great God, have pity!” – done here with a certain helpless immobility, no gesturing or arm-waving. And when she tells Alfredo, after all his insults, “You’ll never understand how much I love you”, McVicar risks having her go to him and caress him, as if everything’s going to be alright. Verdi’s marking here is typical: “In a very feeble voice and (not “but”) with passion.” This is hard to get right, but El-Khoury succeeds. It’s an overwhelming detail.In general the cast support this approach admirably. The billed Alfredo, Carlos Osuna, had to withdraw for family reasons, but Leonardo Capalbo stepped in efficiently, looking and sounding at first like a stock Italian tenor from central casting, but warming to the production, to the extent, perhaps, of slightly overplaying “drunken despair” in the Flora scene. Jason Howard offers a stiff, slightly ponderous Germont, somewhat dry of voice in “Di Provenza il mar”; but Germont is stiff, an uncomfortable, provincial dignitary thrown into the cesspit of the demi-monde. His slow comprehension enables Violetta to grow in stature; and that’s the whole point of the work.Julia Jones directs all this from the pit with a certain discreet sense of style, so that one is hardly conscious of how well it’s all going. She could give more intensity here and there, notably at scene ends, where you can always gauge the electricity from the audience response (however true or false to the quality). And as always with this company, the chorus is tiptop, minor roles excellent, especially Eddie Wade’s ramrod Douphol, and Amanda Baldwin’s Flora. Fluent, eloquent orchestra playing, and an eminently watchable gipsy ballet at Flora’s, strictly not in the script (Verdi seems to have assumed some kind of chorus pantomime), but none the worse for that.

641,"The Tales of Hoffmann, English National Opera",The Tales of Hoffmann,English National Opera,2012-02-11,alexandra Coghlan,"For all its comic fantasy and lilting tunes, there’s nothing pastel-coloured about Offenbach’s The Tales of Hoffmann. Deaths are frequent and bloody, humour is macabre, and emotions run high – being late to the pub is cause enough for violence and conspiracy theories. It’s a world of sliding screens, where a smile always threatens to become a leer, a kiss a murder. Who better (who else?) to inhabit this operatic fantasy-land than Richard Jones, a director who relishes the elision and collision of kitsch and the grotesque. His steel-capped whimsy here hits its mark with deadly and delicious accuracy.There are few operatic comedies that don’t overstay their welcome; the quick thrust of good humour and opera’s wide-load pacing don’t always line up, and when they fail the result can be desperately tedious. The Tales of Hoffmann is always a risk in this respect. Lacking a definitive edition, at its longest the opera endures for a Wagnerian four to five hours, but with some brutal trimming can be reduced to a more manageable three. The compromise (based on the Michael Kaye/Jean-Christophe Keck edition but with changes including the Oeser ending to Giulietta’s Act III) currently being staged at English National Opera may err on the lengthy side, but thanks to Jones’s imaginative direction and Giles Cadle’s designs (not to mention one of the finest ensemble casts of the season) this psychedelic trip down the rabbit-hole never palls.The curtain rises on Hoffmann himself (Barry Banks), alone and struggling to write. His roar of frustration as he hurls yet another sheet of paper aside becomes the lowering orchestral opening, and as orchestral colour and pace gather we find ourselves abandoning the 19th-century world of the pub for an altogether more free-form sequence of worlds for the stories of Hoffmann’s three beloveds – Fifties kitsch for Olympia (“the little girl”), 19th-century Gothic for Antonia (“the artist”) and contemporary pop-art for Giulietta (“the reckless beauty”). Anchoring these adventures are Cadle’s designs, which each inhabit the same architectural space, reimagining the fixtures with dextrous variation.This coherence of design, coupled with the authentic casting of a single singer not only for the three villains of the piece, but also for Hoffmann’s three loves (four if you count Stella), gives a welcome sense of through-direction and thematic coherence to a work that can so easily feel laboriously episodic.Offenbach’s score might not stand up to close musicological scrutiny, but his gauzy melodies and bravura set pieces offer a grateful platform for singers. Leading the cast is a technically secure Barry Banks, whose Hoffmann is a fever of late-Romantic passion. From a poised “Kleinzach” he grew into the more sustained lyricism required by the Antonia and Giulietta episodes, offering not only his habitual beauty of tone, but rather more vocal weight that we’ve heard from him before. With Jones’s production undermining emotional authenticity at every turn, Banks struggled slightly with the arc of his hero – not a problem shared by young American soprano Georgia Jarman (pictured above), making her ENO debut as Olympia/Antonia/Giulietta/Stella.Most at home in the coloratura rigidity of Olympia (her “Les oiseaux dans la charmille” was a triumph of vocal and choreographical precision), Jarman nevertheless made for an affecting Antonia (playing off against Clive Bayley’s Dr Miracle), and though the demands of Giulietta exposed the slightly pushed quality in her tone, this was a hugely convincing achievement for so young a singer.Support came in abundance from Bayley’s trio of villains (pictured left - does anyone do sinister quite as well as Bayley?), whose benign Coppelius gave way to the real menace of Miracle and Dapertutto, as well as from Simon Butteriss as the cross-dressing Cochenille and pirouetting servant (and artist manqué) Frantz. Yet even among the visual clamour of Jones’s staging and a universally strong cast, it was Christine Rice who stood out. This British mezzo just gets better and better, and here as Muse/Nicklausse it was the rounded beauty of her upper register that really shone, set off by the unlikely juxtaposition with her grinning Just William schoolboy persona – grubby knees, conker and all.The Tales of Hoffmann will never be the greatest opera, but in Jones’s hands its weaknesses are celebrated – transfigured into brittle wit and even, on occasion, beauty. Yet among the chatter of cultural references (Disney vies with Manga and Banksy, and I still can’t place the gorilla who stalks the action in Act III) something gets lost. Perhaps partly the fault of Antony Walker’s rather woolly musical direction, this production lacks the violence so key to Hoffmann’s nightmare-vision. The stakes here are never quite real, and in sacrificing menace for surreal humour Jones blunts the fangs that peep out from the opera’s broad smile.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/tales-hoffmann-english-national-opera,
642,"Der Rosenkavalier, English National Opera",Der Rosenkavalier,English National Opera,2012-01-30,David Benedict,"As in sex, so it is in music: there’s a lot riding on the climax. The celebrated third act trio of Der Rosenkavalier is arguably the most famous orgasm in music – dear reader, can you name a better one? – but time it wrongly and you’ll regret it. There is, however, absolutely nothing regrettable about this A-list cast in the hands of director David McVicar and conductor Edward Gardner. Theirs is the most assured, most riveting Rosenkavalier in this country for years.Lush, plush and dangerous to know though Strauss’s score is, many directors shy away from the opera for the simple reason that there’s nothing you can “do” with it. Hofmannstahl’s libretto is too inextricably linked to a Viennese period, its class and demeanour, to be shifted radically in order to illustrate a directorial conceit. Indeed, few operas outside Mozart have more convincing and crucial dramatic detail in both music and text so all you have to do is follow the instructions and do it well – which is considerably easier said than done.Paradoxically, the precision of the writing can be a stumbling block. Aside from native/fluent German speakers, too many singers faced with a libretto this wordy wind up delivering generalisations that merely serve to underline the opera’s longueurs. But McVicar’s mining of the relationships and this cast’s punctilious performances make an ideal case for opera in translation. These singing actors make you realise there’s far more to this opera than can be fitted on to a highlights disc.As the Marschallin sings just before the trio, “There is no woman that can escape this fate.” That inexorable working of time on lovers, the opera’s governing idea, is dramatised in three acts covering the action of two days which see Sarah Connolly’s coltish Octavian’s shifting allegiance from Amanda Roocroft’s watchful Marschallin to Sophie Bevan’s vivid Sophie (pictured above right with Connolly). They’re assisted by McVicar’s own set design (pictured below) which although considerably less extravagant than most productions, does a surprising amount of thematic work. The same room, differently dressed for each of the three addresses, acts as a kind of calm, cyclical backdrop with the final lovers mirroring those of the opening. The idea is even expressed in the wigs: Sophie’s hairstyle is a blonder, crucially younger, version of the Marschallin’s.Roocroft doesn’t have the supposedly “ideal” creamy Straussian soprano tone but she makes up for that with the depth of her characterisation. Her quiet, first act reflections on how she too was young once are tinged with exquisite resignation. She also plays her character’s necessary high status effortlessly. Keeping her vocal power in check means that the dramatic moments that really demand it – the dismissal of Ochs ­– really land. Roocroft also savours her character’s lust. In the opening bed scene, momentarily distracted by sounds from outside, Octavian sits up and looks out of the window, only to have Roocroft yank his head back into her lap for matters more urgent.A tiny moment like that is indicative of the constant shifts in power that McVicar opens up in the minutely calibrated tensions not only between the Marschallin and Octavian but between Octavian and Sophie. In the latter role, Bevan makes an outstanding debut. Never pert, she’s vivacious and excitable and her performance is thrillingly grounded by a vocal richness and power wholly unexpected in a role usually sung by a silvery high soubrette. Her command instantly suggests her not only as a Susannah-in-waiting, but a Countess.Linking the women is Connolly’s glowingly Octavian. Her top register is so powerfully resonant that it allows her to reveal this adolescent’s supremely cocky self-assurance. Then, just when you’ve earmarked her character as headstrong, she stops the heart by simply standing still, her eyes filling with tears as the Marschallin gently dismisses her.Connolly also dignifies the problematic third act with wit (and a proper Yorkshire accent) rather than the hammy “comic” overacting beloved of lesser mezzos in the wrangling with Ochs. In any other production, John Tomlinson’s bravura turn (pictured left) would steal the show. The sheer heft of his sound and the burnished tone in the middle of his voice indicates just how much of a good time he’s having but McVicar’s grip ensures that his character’s gleeful vulgarity never topples over into caricature.  All of this is cushioned, controlled and driven by Edward Gardneron top form. He conjures wonderfully well-upholstered string playing and hugely evocative sounds from the woodwind and low brass. Better yet, from the racing of the overture to the dangerously but thrillingly slow trio, his individual tempi are absolutely linked into the whole. Strauss may have written a luscious drama for three lovers, but the orchestra has a role all its own as ultimately revealed in the aforementioned orgasm. Heralded by the yearning of the horns, Gardner’s players unleash a climatic flood of sound that crowns the characters who, like the audience, appear stunned by the emotional release. MORE RICHARD STRAUSS ON THEARTSDESKDer Rosenkavalier, Royal Opera (2009).

643,"Don Giovanni, Royal Opera",Don Giovanni,Royal Opera,2012-01-22,alexandra Coghlan,"Francesca Zambello’s production of Don Giovanni may only be 10 years old, but is already showing signs of decrepitude. Even back in its youth in 2002-3, this staging never had much of a spring in its step, but at least there were some fantastic casts to compensate. Bryn Terfel, Anna Netrebko, Simon Keenlyside and Erwin Schrott have all taken their turn here, but even with Gerald Finley returning in the title role there’s little the current incumbents can do to do rescue this aged and confused attempt at a seduction.Set outside what appears to be a particularly ugly municipal swimming pool c1990 – all glass panes and curving edges – Zambello’s tragedy plays out under the constant gaze of a Madonna. Perched precariously (and nonsensically) above the action, hands aloft in pity or helplessness, the statue is as ineffectual a moral framing device as the closing ensemble, though seemingly lacking any of Mozart’s irony. The Act I finale calls the revolve into play, flipping us from 1990s modernism into rather half-hearted 1790s decadence, and making brief sense of the quasi-authentic jewel coloured costumes. Visually it’s all functional enough, but really the best that can be said for the late Maria Bjørnson’s designs is that (with the exception of the suspended hand of doom that signals the Commendatore’s acquiescence – a bewildering piece of visual distraction) they don’t actively get in the way.There’s little specificity to the production and still less psychology, leaving singers desperately alone and exposed dramatically. If revival director Duncan MacFarland had given Katarina Karnéus’s Donna Elvira any instructions other than to overact in a wilfully unfocused sort of way then they were never evident. Lorenzo Regazzo as Leporello missed more laughs than he hit, while Irini Kyriakidou’s Zerlina defied Mozart’s most exquisitely characterised vocal writing to deliver bland efficiency; even Gerald Finley’s Don (pictured right with Karneus as Elvira) was a rather quiet affair, lacking his usual presence and failing to bring the necessary menace to Mozart’s libertine. Vocally however his was certainly the most consistent performance of the night, his characteristically assured delivery lacking only the electricity that the production seemed to drain from everything it touched.While Adam Plachetka’s dark-toned Masetto was a pleasant surprise – a personality and voice travelling easily out into the amphitheatre – and Matthew Polenzani (as a particularly Italianate Don Ottavio) conjured a miraculous pianissimo for the da capo of “Dalla sua pace”, Regazzo’s Leporello was the evening’s greatest disappointment. Under-projected both dramatically and vocally (can there be a voice that has fallen more steeply away from its early potential?), his was a catalogue aria almost entirely without laughs, and while he warmed up for the comedic seduction of Elvira it didn’t seem enough to compensate for the lack of earlier personality, or the blandness of his contribution to the fateful closing dinner scene.Things improved somewhat with Hibla Gerzmava’s Donna Anna. Hers is a serious, lovely instrument, if occasionally pushing a little sharp in the upper registers, and a solid “Or sai chi l‘honore” grew into an altogether more delicately shaped “Crudele”. Perhaps the most interesting member of the current cast,  Karnéus never fully settled as Donna Elvira, some beautiful moments balanced by unusual passages of technical vulnerability; the latter end of “Mi tradi” felt distinctly tired, its demands telling both on the quality of vocal production and her dramatic delivery.While Zambello’s production and a rather uncherished revival may be blamed for much, there were also a whole set of alternative issues emerging from Constantinos Carydis’s pit. An overture whose D minor ferocity was glimpsed only in the far distance, and even then only for teasing moments, set the tone for a performance of cut and paste music-making. There was no organic flow to tempos, which were either too fast or (most often) much too ponderous and slow, and defeated any sense of dramatic arc or development.Carydis’s is a beautiful beat, but too often focused on expressive nuance while basic ensemble suffered. Tensions between voice and solo cello in “Batti, batti” made for a distinctly tense few minutes, while the chorus managed to botch one of their only entries in the Act I finale in spectacular style.Such is the opera’s lack of heat that even 6 ft jets of flames in the damnation scene do little to hot things up. This was never a classic production, and on the basis of this lengthy revival (it is to be hoped that cast B, featuring Schrott among others will be an improvement) perhaps it’s time for the Royal Opera to admit defeat and put Zambello’s Don Giovanni to bed for good. Like the soul of the rakish Don himself, there simply isn’t enough here to make redemption an option.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/don-giovanni-royal-opera,
644,"Giulio Cesare in Egitto, Opera North",Giulio Cesare in Egitto,Opera North,2012-01-15,graham Rickson,"It’s the pace that takes getting used to in a Baroque opera. Five words in the libretto can easily take up five minutes to sing, and Handel’s music is often disconcertingly jaunty, even when tragic events are unfolding. Tim Albery has also directed Opera North’s current Madam Butterfly revival, a thrillingly cinematic, fast-moving production. His Giulio Cesare is judiciously pruned, with a total running time of about three hours. The cuts prevent any sense of stasis; what’s remarkable is just how much entertainment Handel’s imperial epic provides.Albery’s 20th-century update is dominated Leslie Travers’s brutalist concrete barrier, enclosing a pyramid shape which can be revolved – the exterior harsh and grey, the interior bronzed, golden. There’s a lot of scope for shadowy lurking, notably as the production opens and Giulio Cesare’s rival Pompeo is cleanly, nastily dispatched by Tolomeo, the Egyptian King. Countertenor James Laing's Tolomeo steals the evening, even attracting pantomime-style boos at the curtain call. He’s slightly comic, camply attired (he and his sister/wife Cleopatra are the only characters dressed in bright colours) and finally loathsome, the golden fingernail extensions he wears at one point deliciously suggesting petty cruelty and sadism.Cleopatra, beautifully sung by Sarah Tynan, is a brilliant match for him, physically and vocally – she’s not an eyeliner-streaked Liz Taylor clone but small and blonde. Initially we’re slightly repelled by her shallow vanity, particularly when she sits on the steps and seductively unrolls her stockings, flippantly tossing them aside. Tynan’s sheer stamina is a revelation; Handel’s protracted arias never sound strained, even when she’s been chained by one leg to the stage floor. You’ve fallen in love with her by the time the opera reaches its climax, despite the fact that she’s played a pretty passive role in the events leading up to her union with Cesare, soberly and impressively portrayed by Pamela Helen Stephen (pictured above right).The most impressive singing comes from Ann Taylor and Kathryn Rudge as Cornelia and Sesto, the murdered Pompeo’s widow and daughter; their duet in Act 1 is marvellous, the two voices beautifully matched. Sesto finally succeeds in murdering Tolomeo, who’s then left painfully suspended by his ankles. At which point the set does one of its periodic revolves, enabling Laing to be untied before his circulatory system has given up. Cesare, earlier thought to have drowned, reappears and declares his love for Cleopatra, the new Queen of Egypt. Alas, she now dons her deceased brother’s fingernails, implying that her reign won’t be any more enlightened than his was.Robert Howarth makes his company debut, playing harpsichord continuo and confidently directing slimmed-down orchestral forces. Cesare’s aria Va tacito includes a virtuosic horn obbligato, while the entry of the full horn quartet near the opera’s close is a spectacular moment. Thomas C Hase’s lighting neatly conveys the feeling of darkness, of intrigue, while always allowing us to see just enough. But it’s the quality of the singing which makes any opera worth seeing, and the singing in this production is consistently impressive.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/giulio-cesare-egitto-opera-north,
645,2011: Schoolroom Fairies and a Cross-Dressing Mezzo,2011: Schoolroom Fairies and a Cross-Dressing Mezzo,,2011-12-30,David Nice,"Two precisely imagined dream-visions bookend a cornucopia on the musical front. I’ll start with the deadly but save the apparently frivolous for the top slot. Christopher Alden’s pitiless exiling of Britten’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream from Elizabethan wood to 1960s school block was to opera what Lars von Trier’s Melancholia was to film: audience-sundering, often alienating, sometimes enticing, but very much its own consistent world. Its splendid cast and conductor Leo Hussain worked as one to enhance the paradoxes of its terrible beauty.ENO’s newcomer on the schoolboy front, Nico Muhly’s Two Boys, rang hollow in a way that Turnage’s Anna Nicole over at the Royal Opera did not. The post-Brecht/Weill American tragicomedy's pathos and absurdity were stoked and focused by the irreproachable teamwork of Antonio Pappano and Richard Jones. Their Puccini Trittico ended with a best-ever Gianni Schicchi, though the indisposition of Anja Harteros robbed us of a high-level heartbreaking Suor Angelica. Back at ENO around the same time, Weinberg's The Passenger - beyond entertainment, an honourable memorial to Holocaust survivors, not a masterpiece but with masterly scenes - stood in a class of its own.There were plenty of vocal performances to treasure. Two intense, very different home-grown mezzos led the way: Christine Rice, heartbreaking as a yellow-starred Marguerite in Terry Gilliam’s fitfully brilliant ENO Berlioz Damnation of Faust, and Alice Coote, an incandescent Prince Charming (pictured right by Bill Cooper) in a long-awaited Royal Opera production of Massenet’s Cendrillon. If Coote takes gold, it’s because she also held her nerve so beautifully in Lorin Maazel’s otherwise leaden-footed Mahler Das Lied von der Erde. Much more evenly-matched voice-and-orchestra magic came from singular soprano Anu Komsi, melting into the elements wielded by her husband, conductor Sakari Oramo, in Sibelius’s Luonnotar. Most promising newcomer? Soprano Sarah-Jane Brandon, briefly glimpsed crowning a chamber version of Mahler's Fourth Symphony in Christ Church Spitalfields.There were unforgettably strange meetings of intelligence and heart in song recitals from Toby Spence and a pianist we need to see more of, Julian Milford, at Cheltenham, Diana Damrau choosing harpist Xavier de Maistre as her partner in Edinburgh’s Queen’s Hall, and, gliding luminously in during December, Anne Schwanewilms and Charles Spencer rising to greatness as they need to in Mahler’s Rückert Lieder.At the other end of the Wigmore year, another partnership I don’t expect to hear bettered in the toughest of programmes came from violinist Leonidas Kavakos and pianist Enrico Pace, almost stealing the show in Schubert. Another enterprising fiddler, Isabelle Faust, along  with the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Kazuki Yamada, persuaded me a nearly-new work is here to stay, Thomas Larcher’s real adventure of a violin concerto.The only Prom I caught which worked from start to finish was a late-nighter where time stood still to the lone voice of folk singer June Tabor. Out of two big orchestral visits elsewhere, Abbado and the Lucerne Festival Orchestra had a greater flexibility to match gorgeous balances than Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic. No Bruckner, not even the chorale-blazing Fifth, was ever going to match my experience of Abbado’s Mahler Ninth in Lucerne the year before (now my DVD/recording of the year, and Graham Rickson's too), but that’s my problem. Surpassingly magical soundwaves also came from Abbado, playing Prospero in a Rome performance of Tchaikovsky’s The Tempest, fusing two Italian orchestras in panavision splendour (pictured above left).Outside the musical comfort zone, my very limited TV watching of the year yielded a retrospective wonder, surely the best it’s ever offered: all seven unflagging series of The West Wing spread over half a year. Selective theatregoing provided less to wonder at, only one truly surprising performance – Greta Scacchi as Bette Davis – and one perfect world-within-world, Gogol’s according to Richard Jones in his Government Inspector (pictured above right) meticulously choreographed to David Sawer’s score. Much more fun than most painted it, the musical Lend Me a Tenor deserved better than its short-lived run. But there was one show which crossed all boundaries:2011 Highlight: Sasha Regan’s all-male transformation of Gilbert and Sullivan’s Iolanthe in its atmospheric relocation to Wilton’s Music Hall: camp only in part, dialogue and lyrics more razor-sharp than ever and, yes, moving to tears.2011 Travel treat: the discovery of Iceland, ending up with an all-day, open-door jamboree in Reykjavik which was a platonic ideal of civic celebration.2011 Letdown: Hard to choose between Peter Brook’s lifeless Mozart evisceration A Magic Flute and The Killing of Sister George at the Arts Theatre – a period piece not worth reviving and catastrophically miscast.2012 Recommendation: Regan has promised us more G&S, the prayed-for Patience, launching in the tiny Union Theatre on 15 February. If you want me to put on a straight face, then it would have to be the long-overdue London stage premiere of Adams’s The Death of Klinghoffer at the English National Opera.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/2011-schoolroom-fairies-and-cross-dressing-mezzo,
646,"2011: Anthemic Elbow, Iranian drama, and Fear and Loathing in Elsinore",2011: Anthemic Elbow,Iranian drama,2011-12-28,james Woodall,"The Barbican has always led the way in London in international theatre programming. The year there ended on a high, with Thomas Ostermeier’s Hamlet from the Schaubühne laying down new markers for transgressive commitment. I was sceptical about it when I saw the Berlin première in 2008, and our own critic was not, commendably enough, in a mood to be fooled around with. Yet a production which stages, so stylistically, terror, insanity and loathing (all in Shakespeare) with six actors straining every sinew without entirely ridiculing the play has to be respected.From the Bard to a big blast: Elbow had, until the 2008 Mercury for The Seldom Seen Kid, been a bit of an indie secret, cleverly matching over almost two decades lots of early 1970s progressive techniques with edgy millennial urban and personal concerns. Pretty mainstream now, the five-piece’s two nights at the Dome (I was at the second) were nonetheless sumptuous, funny and inspiring, honey-voiced front man Guy Garvey proving himself a master raconteur – Mancunian patter, to say nothing of those big-hearted songs, brilliantly demolishing even the most knowing of critical defences. From Build a Rocket, Boys! “The Birds” (opening both album and gig) is my most-played singalong track of the year.At another end of the musical spectrum, the Polish-based I, Culture Orchestra, made up of young east European musicians (and from even further east: Armenia, Azerbaijan), is modelled on Daniel Barenboim’s West-Eastern Divan Orchestra (Jews and Arabs). On 9 November at the RFH, they were only seven concerts old and I was charmed. Prokofiev’s Scythian Suite was played with immense gusto, ditto Szymanowski's Symphony No 4; seeing 89-year-old Neville Marriner then step briskly on to the podium for a zinging Tchaikovsky Symphony No 4 was one of the more refreshing high art experiences of the year.2011’s most unexpected film was Iranian Asghar Farhadi’s A Separation (pictured above right) winner of the Berlinale’s Golden Bear. Predictably – can’t see ’em all – I missed it in Berlin, though there were some other pleasurable surprises both there and at its summer companion festival in Locarno. For some reason, Argentina is turning up trumps: El premio and Medianeras in Berlin, and the coolly complex El estudiante in Locarno, show in different ways, after a catastrophic thirty years, a compelling society trying to decipher itself. Farhadi’s marital drama, meanwhile (it came to London) – set in a society suffering its own catastrophe since 1979 – has a Shakespearian gravitas and intensity.Still from overseas, the Group of Seven will have been heard of by few in Britain. They were turn-of-the-century Canadian painters, headed up by outdoorsman Tom Thomson (Joe Creek, 1914, pictured left) – he died before reaching 40. A fascinating hang of his and his peers’ paintings and drawings at the Dulwich Picture Gallery was an education, inevitably, but also a revelation. Rarer still are the El Lissitzky originals (amongst others) at the RA until mid-January in perhaps 2011’s most original exhibition, “Building the Revolution”, about Soviet art and architecture – but it's the early revolutionary art here, the Constructivists’, that really matters.2011 highlight: A small-scale Electra at the Gate Theatre, Notting Hill, was a study in precise, updated adaptation, passionate acting, and packed a punch with every line.2011 letdown: Peter Brook’s Une flûte enchantée, his fileted version of Mozart’s The Magic Flute, was dismayingly bad: a reductio ad absurdum too far.2012 recommendation: Edvard Munch: The Modern Eye (Tate Modern, 28 June to 14 October) will try and take the Norwegian painter out of his clichéd late-19th century posting into post-Expressionism and towards photography and film.",https://theartsdesk.com/new-music/2011-anthemic-elbow-iranian-drama-and-fear-and-loathing-elsinore,
647,2011: Unlovely Love Stories and Unerotic Erotic Tales,2011: Unlovely Love Stories and Unerotic Erotic Tales,,2011-12-28,Josh Spero,"While I'm still learning to disentangle my mezzo from my Meistersinger, I enjoyed a lot of the opera on offer in London this year, especially at English National Opera. Parsifal was perfect and Rameau's Castor and Pollux, while probably a little too Germanic in direction with its dancing amputated legs and unerotic nudity, was wonderfully sung. I especially enjoyed the premiere of Nico Muhly's Two Boys, whose internet-era set design suited its perverse modern ""love"" story. The first chorus, which built up comprehensible layers into a modem's hum, was genius.On the art front, Egon Schiele's drawings at Richard Nagy made a low-key but winning show. His naked subjects, all the colours of bruises and drawn with as much violence, are sometimes vulnerable, sometimes feisty, but always rejections of the pure Classical nude. They as much as anything evoke Central European desperation before and during World War One. Speaking of desperation, George Condo's Jesus at the Hayward Gallery was pitiful and imploring, the only really moving picture in the whole show.It was a good year for controversial art on TV. My review of Graffiti Wars, about the tit-for-tat war between street artist Banksy and graffiti tagger King Robbo, ran up dozens of comments, most of which were delightfully scathing. But the biggest stir was caused by Fiona Bruce and Philip Mould's Fake or Fortune?, which followed some potentially very valuable paintings: a possible Monet, a rediscovered Winslow Homer. If anything gave an insight into the methods and madness of the art market, and its frequent cruelties, it was this show.2011 Highlight: Discovering Wagner properly with the ENO's perfect Parsifal. In a space-age yet Holocaust-suggestive set, the most tender music emerged from the pit, led by Mark Wigglesworth, and John Tomlinson's Gurnemanz made me cry.2011 Letdown: Frank Stella is revered as an academic artist - What is an image? How can we depict depth and space in a painting? - but his retrospective at Haunch of Venison was ultimately depressing for its lack of interest in the human.Watch a short clip of Two Boys: ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/2011-unlovely-love-stories-and-unerotic-erotic-tales,
648,"Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, Royal Opera",Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg,Royal Opera,2011-12-20,David Nice,"A young chap from Elsewhere woos an alderman's daughter: not Dick Whittington in panto London, but Wagner's Walther von Stolzing in an unseasonal Nuremberg. No one is going to mind the solstitial disjunction - celebrating midsummer revels in the dead of winter - when this great saga of art and society is buoyed up by Antonio Pappano's lovingly prepared conducting, a good cast, lusty chorus and colourful costumes. Yet only folk determined on seasonal jollity to the exclusion of all else might not feel a certain want of the darker side to the human predicament which ought to pave the way to comic reconciliation.I'm not suggesting for a moment any yanking-forward in Germany's troubled history, least of all to any time since this plea for great national art was penned. There was a bit of earlier, cheerful anachronism about David McVicar's Biedermeier vision at Glyndebourne as well as in Richard Jones's Welsh National Opera production, the most detailed, perceptive and, alas, short-lived we've seen in recent years; still, both ended in irony-free harmony. Graham Vick's long-serving Royal Opera show is a cosy, almost cartoonish vision of Dürer's golden age with prominent roles for codpieces, model city landmarks and mullets.It works especially well in the lively finales, the first two of which Pappano springs into miraculously co-ordinated life. Outsider Walther's rocking of the established mastersingers' tight ship is exuberantly served as Simon O'Neill's bright, stalwart if sometimes under-ballasted tenor takes wing with his rhapsody - it can't be stressed too much how supportive the conducting is of the singers' need to move forward and survive the evening - and Act II ends with meticulously choreographed and voiced civic brawling. Vick's production as restaged by Elaine Kidd and Richard Hudson's designs still pull out the stops out here (pictured below) and there's even a hint of a more realistic wanton destruction as a yob sets about smashing up one of the toy houses.The problem for me rests with the tirelessly well sung Hans Sachs of Wolfgang Koch. Sachs is the philosopher-cobbler with whose emerging predicament - a balance between the love he clearly feels for young Eva Pogner and a desire that inspired musical-poetic youth in the form of her more youthfully suitable match Walther should win the contest - the public should increasingly engage. We've been spoiled to a certain extent by Gerald Finley's surprise success in the part at Glyndebourne - he doesn't have the line that the more baritonal Koch can spin through the bigger phrases, but by Act III most of the audience was rooting for him - and still more by Bryn Terfel, Sachs to the life. No doubt Terfel, when he takes over the role in a one-off Royal Opera concert performance in Birmingham, will bring something of the deeper despair out of which Jones's Sachs had to rouse himself. But he might have had a harder time in the context of this revival, which rather sells short the uncommon cobbler's shock at everyday folly.Koch's Sachs does snap, rather impressively but too late; and though  good at the geniality, he's one of several characters who need more help with movement (the backward walk looks awkward). Two who don't are Toby Spence's thoroughly likeable apprentice David - evidently a Walter in waiting - and Emma Bell's Eva, a model of well-pointed diction and a soprano at last up to the sudden demands of the grateful apostrophe to Sachs as friend and guide. She also gives us the best opening lines in the Quintet (pictured left to right: Koch, O'Neill, Bell, Heather Shipp's Magdalene, Spence) since Felicity Lott. Peter Coleman-Wright is a safe, cleanly sung, not terribly funny but never overdone Beckmesser; the fine line between realism and humour really needs a stronger directorial viewpoint.Never mind; the Quintet's happy sunshine is what we need to stay out for the colourful St John's Day revels down in the meadows: the Covent Garden stage has far more space to play with than Glyndebourne in the too up-front McVicar staging, and the guild processions, including bespectacled tailors and floury bakers, still look good. Collectors of Meistersinger performances - and they are even more legion than the fair number of productions the masterpiece has notched up over recent decades - will relish a strong last meeting (pictured below) between the Sachs of today (Koch) and of the recent past (John Tomlinson, now in authoritative if rather loud voice as father Pogner).Most impressive is how much of this multi-faceted score Pappano already has under his belt. The interpretation can only get stronger, and may hit a yet more eloquent, profound stride in the crucial confrontations of the morning before the song-contest, but there's no sense either of slack or rush. This has really been quite the year for the ongoing great work of the Royal Opera's Music Director, and it should be recognised as such by the wider telly-watching public who rightly warmed to his Opera Italia series when he introduces his own performance of Tosca at length on Christmas Eve. A skilled practitioner who can really put across the meaning and value of his subject on TV rather than a celebrity presenter: now that's something we need much more of during 2012 - assuming BBC Four is still around to deliver it.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/die-meistersinger-von-n%C3%BCrnberg-royal-opera,
649,"UnDance, Mark-Anthony Turnage/Wayne McGregor/Mark Wallinger, Sadler’s Wells",UnDance,Mark,2011-12-02,Judith Flanders,"It is unusual in art for collaborators to be of equal star-wattage. The pairing of Benjamin Britten and WH Auden was one such. Another, much longer-lasting, was Stravinsky and Balanchine, a partnership of equals that endured for nearly half a century. More recently, Antony Gormley has worked with both Akram Khan and Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui, to great effect. Can Turnage, McGregor and Wallinger replicate these? This has been the question.The answer is, unequivocally, yes. Wallinger took the lead, presenting a rich brew of possible starting points, which included the idea of the “window” created by the Renaissance architect Alberti, a grid through which artists learned to create perspectival views, merged – or meshed – with the grid the 19th-century photographer Eadweard Muybridge used to measure movement as he created stop-motion photography to break motion down into its component parts. There was also a side-exploration of verbs listed by the sculptor Richard Serra (“to roll, to crease, to fold, to store, to blend”) and the idea that the UN’s logo might also, in trouble spots, be read as ""un-"" – un-do, un-learn – “a plea,” as he said, “for redemption in places where we have messed up”.Turnage then set up dichotomies, finding ways of presenting both dualism and duality over eight sections, with some lovely orchestral writing, especially for the woodwinds. McGregor in his turn took on concept and score, and starts with first principles: his 10 dancers, in flesh-coloured T-shirts that allow his dancers to resemble Muybridge’s naked athletes, line up in front of the squared graph of a backdrop. Behind them, a film of their actions runs slightly out of sync, mirroring, shadowing, or sometimes paralleling as they work their dancerly way through Serra’s and Turnage’s verbs – Run, Twist, Jump. This sounds very cerebral, very contemporary art-speak-ish, but it is in reality lovely, extraordinarily musical, and much simpler in performance than in conception. McGregor’s hyper-extended vocabulary here seems entirely apposite, a way of testing the boundaries just as the grid measures boundaries, the film shows endings and, looped, endlessness. His trademark moves – not just the sky-high extensions, but the tiny little flicked jumps that come out of nowhere, the bends, the bows – echo Turnage’s music, not slavishly, but respectfully and with a sense of reciprocating pleasure. The very complexity of Wallinger’s ideas has been taken by all three men to produce a masterclass in unified thinking. The first half of the evening is less successful. Turnage’s 1997 one-hander opera, Twice Through the Heart, is masterfully sung by mezzo Sarah Connolly, who gives a performance of shining simplicity and truth as the battered wife who murders her husband and is twice incarcerated: once by her abuser, then by the law. McGregor, directing, has placed her in a black set, furnished only with a table and chair (beautifully lit by Lucy Carter, who also did the lovely lighting in UnDance).Unfortunately, the piece has had 3D designs superimposed over it by OpenEndedGroup (Marc Downie, Shelley Eshkar and Paul Kaiser). Some of the designs are very beautiful. Illegible ""writing"" unscrolls in a legible/illegible duality. The spider-webby, slightly Miss Havisham air the designers have created is interesting. But sometimes their response to the music is plonkingly literal – the line “When I might wash you away” is accompanied by a picture of a sink – and often merely decorative.The problem is not with the design itself, but the fact that the 3D specs darken and flatten the “real” 3D object on stage – Sarah Connolly. Connolly and Turnage create a true and terrible world.

650,"Tosca, English National Opera",Tosca,English National Opera,2011-11-27,David Nice,"Who is more likely to be an operatic creature of flesh and blood: Puccini's young diva, unexpectedly caught up in the infernal machine of a lustful tyrant, or Tchaikovsky's teenager impetuously pouring out her soul in a love letter to a man she's just fallen for? Usually, you'd go for Tatyana over Tosca every time. At ENO it's currently the other way round. While Deborah Warner's new production of Eugene Onegin unfathomably misses most of the truths in a story we can all identify with, Catherine Malfitano's take on the best if most overdone Italian operatic thriller in the repertoire makes potentially outlandish melodrama believable. That's almost as true of the revival as it was of this ENO Tosca's impressive first outing, even if the two lovers this time round are less lissom.As in the Onegin, the principals are vocally up to the mark - and that's no mean achievement here given three big British voices going flat-out for some of the toughest physical singing in all Italian opera. They need to be loud to ride conductor Stephen Lord's exciting, detailed but sometimes over-broad and relentlessly grand approach to Puccini's ever-astonishing score; you wish he'd sometimes rein the ENO Orchestra in a little to let the battle of the top notes in the sadistic Act II confrontations really ring out.The victory cry of Gwyn Hughes Jones's Jacobin Cavaradossi (pictured right) at the news of Napoleon's victory uniquely does, simply because Puccini lets it stand apart from the orchestra, and a magnificent job he makes of it. Act I's introductory aria is a bit blowsy - this is only supposed to be an artist comparing beauties, after all - and rather short on sunshine and roses, but Hughes Jones does find some subtlety in the great lament we can only refer to as ""E lucevan le stelle"" (and it really is time Edmund Tracey's creaky and often ill-fitting English translation was replaced with one that moved a little with the times and the musical lines).Claire Rutter's Tosca is a generous spirit with an only occasionally troubling vibrato in the middle register; again the top is unflinchingly full and intense. Her most straightforward duet with her lover before it all goes wrong settles to something rather gorgeous, even if this pair aren't quite as believable in love as Amanda Echalaz and Julian Gavin were last time round. Rutter's strongest moment in the first act, though, is the feeling she projects just before she leaves into the last pang of jealousy kindled by Iago-esque Scarpia, playing on her fatal questioning of lover Mario's fidelity.This, you suspect, is a battle of wills that can only kindle further, especially given Anthony Michaels-Moore's effortless projection in the grand ""Te Deum"" cocktail of lust and religion. And it does, avoiding the pitfalls of stagey, melodramatic Scarpia-Tosca confrontations in the most celebrated of all operatic central acts. All that's missing for the last degree of callous, calculating authority is a resonance to Michaels-Moore's lower depths; some of the bottom notes get lost.Rutter makes believable a youngish woman fearfully improvising her way through a political mousetrap of which she had no inkling, and being further appalled as it turns personal. She also manages Italianate artistry at the climax of the aria I'm once again going to insist on identifying as ""Vissi d'arte"", a convincingly frozen moment in time. Malfitano's staging otherwise presents every dramatic turn of the screw in Scarpia's awful bargaining with a helpless woman as plausible, so that the twist of the knife (the aftermath of ""Tosca's kiss"" pictured left) comes to seem inevitable.You sense, too, Puccini's unsurpassable sense of musical-dramatic timing even if Lord, for all the wonderful colours he brings out from the orchestra - a lustrous harp sweep here, a scything double-bass line there - doesn't have the fire and air ENO music director Edward Gardner brought to the score last time round. The endgame on the battlements of the Castel Sant'Angelo, though, is as strong and satisfying as it was then, with Rutter bearing out the metaphysical dimension of set designer Frank Philipp Schlössmann's starry night sky - no dawn for this Tosca - in a final fall from a height which is liberating rather than desperate. Even if you've become used to the starry Gheorghiu-Kaufmann-Terfel trio, in Jonathan Kent's much less perceptive Royal Opera staging, you shouldn't be disappointed by this.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/tosca-english-national-opera-0,
651,"The Merry Wives of Windsor, Guildhall School of Music and Drama",The Merry Wives of Windsor,Guildhall School of Music and Drama,2011-11-15,David Nice,"Theatregoers may be disappointed to read on and discover I mean Otto Nicolai's Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor, the only 19th-century Shakespeare-based opera in the German language to hold the stage. Which it did, and not just in Germany, until the arrival of Verdi's infinitely superior Falstaff. Is this that rare thing, German comedy in music between Beethoven's Eighth Symphony and Richard Strauss's Till Eulenspiegel that's actually funny? Not really; Wagner's Die Meistersinger stands alone. But it's a piece which offers plenty of roles for student singers - with two leading sopranos, no less - and the essentially grateful choral writing comes into its own in a last act where Nicolai really is in his moonshiny element.As he is in the overture, deservedly famous for its lovely colours and pretty ideas, though the bulk of the opera has to pass before we hear most of them again; conductor Clive Timms and the GSMD Orchesta put us in a good mood which slowly begins to crack through the determinedly jolly comic-opera duets, trios and ensembles of the evening's first half. Tom Rogers's fun costumes and ingenious sliding set of contemporary small-town life, moving between the Cath Kidston-fabricked Fluth household - for which read the Fords of Windsor - and a host of other adaptable locations, including the more coolly affluent Reich establishment, a bar, a tearoom and an office, keep us amused rather more than director Harry Fehr's looser work on character.All the roles are well sung, an achievement on which the Guildhall can pride itself, but few are well defined. There's the glimmer of characterisation from Jorge Navarro-Colorado's gawky, bespectacled Spärlich, one of the two parent-approved suitors for the hand of Anna (Shakespeare's Ann Page, Verdi's Nannetta). Otherwise a bit too much laughter on stage in proportion to relatively little off is always a bad sign. Coaching of the German dialogue seems to have been rather well done, and all of it projects, but the only time I really chortled was at the second discomforting of Falstaff - Barnaby Rea, big voice and confidence but broad brushstrokes (pictured above with Sky Ingram's Frau Fluth) - when dressed up as the Fat Woman of Brentford (yes, it's funny to hear them sing about ""Die dicke Frau aus Brentford""). Among the many jolly costume gags, this one evoking rather the Horsey Queen of Balmoral is to be relished. And the scene does end with a fun ensemble.Otherwise, the best music after the overture comes in the second half. There's a decent romance for Fenton, with Luis Gomes as the right light lyric to tackle it, and a duet in which a solo violin interposes itself between the lovers as they coo through an elaborate cadenza in Windsor's Garden Tea Rooms - nice touch in the staging, this. Ellie Laugharne's Anna (pictured left with Gomes) has a freer, more easy top than Sky Ingram's Frau Fluth, though both are good and make the most of not very rewarding arias. Sioned Gwen Davies's Frau Reich gets a very German ballad about Herne the Hunter, and has fun in the forest as part of an incipient threesome.Nicolai rather perks up, as any good Teuton should, when drinking, hunting and woods are the issues. The moonlit chorus, as the overture promised, is the loveliest thing in the score - another orchestral melody from way back never gets sung, alas - and the ensemble, splendidly attired in spooking carnival mode on a now opened stage complete with oak and giant full moon, gets not one but two originally textured Falstaff-baiting numbers. This is also where Ciprian Droma, as Herr Reich solemnly impersonating the ""real"" Herne the Hunter, comes into his own as a bass of promise.For all the belated jokiness, you feel that Nicolai, constrained until the forest scene by a comic-opera mode which finds no pithy parallel for Shakespeare's earthy prose, can at last let his hair down in the company of Mendelssohn and Weber and take the supernatural seriously. Verdi, of course, does that, and all else, even better; but the time and dedication invested by these young performers does pay off in this rarity's final scene.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/merry-wives-windsor-guildhall-school-music-and-drama,
652,"Eugene Onegin, English National Opera",Eugene Onegin,English National Opera,2011-11-13,David Nice,"What’s not to love about Tchaikovsky’s candid, lyric scenes drawn from Pushkin’s masterly verse novel? ENO’s advance publicity summed it up neatly by promising “lost love, tragedy, regret”. We’ve most of us been there. That does mean that truthfulness to life can count for even more in a performance than good singing. Both burned their way through Dmitri Tcherniakov’s radical Bolshoi rethink, but while there are four fine voices to help Deborah Warner’s surprisingly traditional production along, the truth flickers very faintly here.Warner updates the action, but by less than a century: prematurely world-weary Onegin uncertainly rejects teenage Tatyana – though not unconditionally or meanly in this staging - and falls in love with her too late, not in the Russia of Nicholas I, Pushkin and the early-Romantic painters but against a backdrop Chekhov and Repin would partly have recognised. The realism also means the kind of long pauses between the scenes of each act that we thought had gone out with the bad old days of the Kirov. Atmospheric images of Russian nature in country and city by designer Tom Pye along with the video team of ENO stalwart Finn Ross and Ian William Galloway aren’t quite the substitute for the musical-dramatic continuity we so badly need.The crucial human heartbeat is, in any case, a faltering one. Edward Gardner’s conducting goes hand in glove with Amanda Echalaz’s Tatyana; both are polished and cleanly profiled but lacking in the seeming spontaneity which should give the leisurely, pastoral first act its kick. Gardner is good on detail, like the quickening of sister Olga's impatience with her suitor and a sorrowful woodwind sympathy for that suitor's later tragic withdrawal; but he sometimes gets a burnished ENO Orchestra to play the emotions too big and solid.Echalaz’s large-scale performance disappoints after her magnificent and credible ENO Tosca. Somehow she never touches the heart like house predecessors Cathryn Pope, with her doll-like fragility, or the much more believably impetuous Orla Boylan, and this Tatyana's transformation to outwardly poised society lady is less impressive than usual. The big and somewhat static delivery is as fatal to the intimacy of the letter scene as is the vast barn in which Tatyana’s bedroom vigil as well as the tea laid out for her mother and nurse seem to take place. There’s the right contrast between interior reflection and outdoor liberation, but too much gets lost here and the peasant rituals seem rather grand and stylised for the relatively modest Larins.Oddly, their bourgeois complacency is shaken not so much by Audun Iversen’s Onegin, the attractive stranger from the nearby estate figuring as the usual cipher in the first scene, but by Toby Spence’s Lensky (pictured right), taking everyone aback with his frank pursuit of the pretty but ordinary sister Olga (Claudia Huckle, serviceable). Spence’s almost dangerous energy sets the stage alight, and he sings his first lyric aria as freely and beautifully as I’ve ever heard it.It's hardly surprising, then, that Act II, Lensky’s territory, works best, though Spence seems encouraged to play his wrath at his best pal's mischief-making a bit theatrically. He manages some of the only magical soft singing of the evening – the other comes, somewhat bizarrely, from Adrian Thompson’s French tutor getting carried away by verses for Tatyana’s nameday – in the most evocatively designed scene of the seven, for the duel by a frozen lake, and Martin Pickard’s fresh translation drives home the point, which is the pointlessness, of this messy, fatal conflict between friends.Come the shift to St Petersburg, and the hall of columns won a round of provincial applause on the first night; but the crucial distinction here, between what should be a now slightly off-the-wall social-misfit Onegin and frigid court society, gets lost when both seem on such good terms, and, lively as Kim Brandstrup’s choreography is throughout, it was odd of Warner to go for the show-offy ecossaise of Tchaikovsky’s grand revision rather than the dramatic continuity of his original. Brindley Sherratt’s straightforward husband-prince (pictured above between Echalaz and Iversen) sings with the expected gravitas, but it’s a surprise when Echalaz and Iversen do finally fire up to a grand final duet in the freezing cold. Too much too late, the motto of Pushkin’s story and Tchaikovsky’s opera, might also be the epitaph of this indecisive production. The Met, sharing honours with ENO, may well be shocked to have it replace the much clearer Robert Carsen narrative which has ruled there quite happily for some time. Given the attempt at a naturalistic vision here, truthful clarity in the characters' motivations is what’s most in short supply.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/eugene-onegin-english-national-opera,
653,"The Mikado, Charles Court Opera, King's Head Theatre",The Mikado,Charles Court Opera,2011-11-08,David Nice,"Is this the year that G&S became definitively chic again? The slow-burn effect of ENO's ""Miller Mikado"" and Mike Leigh's Topsy-Turvy now results in numerous fringe benefits. Sasha Regan's all-male Union Theatre regime has delivered its best yet - Iolanthe at Wilton's Music Hall, the most touching and funny show I've seen over the last 11 months - and now Charles Court Opera gives us more witty operetta-in-close-up with a cast of nine backed up by two pianos. It's not quite on the level of Regan's imaginative refit, but it does place the singing and playing at the forefront, while the genius text-setting and timeless dialogue zap along.The voices are all in better, youthful nick than you ever used to get in the bad old heyday of D'Oyly Carte, but there's one performer who rivets all attention. It's apt that Pooh-Bah is the Lord High Everything Else of the Titipu court - more Westminster than Kyoto, as Jonathan Miller first proved to us was Gilbert's intention - since John Savournin, incarnating him as a scion of public-school privilege with an arching left eyebrow that people should travel miles to see, not only steals the show but also directs it.Since Savournin's brilliance is to deliver the lines of that very superior personage with a natural patrician ease that would even put Stephen Fry to shame - as well as to sing them with a baritonal assurance that suggests he'd be the perfect young Mozart Almaviva - it's baffling why he didn't make sure everyone in the cast also left the extra work to the topsy-turvy text. The minute Lord High Executioner and cheap tailor Ko-Ko makes his entrance, backed up by a court of three, you know Philip Lee's Common Little Man accent is going to be wearing.His is an unusually well-sung, tenor Ko-Ko, and blends well in the most impressively staged number in the show, the witty 'execution' trio with Pooh-Bah and Pish Tush. Yet his ""little list"", delivered as originally written without the usual Richard Suart-style topicalities, falls a bit flat and until we get to the sublime tragicomedy of the ""Tit-willow"" ballad - was there ever a more sublime blend of calculation and pathos, humour and wistfulness? - and the raucous duet with Rosie Strobel's vivacious Katisha, you want to shout out that less would be more. Same applies to Susan Moore's Pitti-Sing, a face made for comedy, but she too needs to realise that Gilbert's wit and the extremely close quarters of the King's Head mean she doesn't have to work overtime for the laughs.Otherwise, the casting is shrewd. Kevin Kyle's Nanki-Poo is a rather sweet busker-minstrel, the only one of the work's characters who doesn't seem to be consumed with self-love, and his red trombone comes in useful not just for discreetly adorning his great solo but also for fanfaring the Lord High Executioner. The maidens, shorn of their introductory chorus, seem costumed from a different show with their Japanesey raven-hair bobs and do the usual business well (pictured right); Catrina Kirkman's Yum-Yum falls an inch short of softening charm, but phrases ""The sun whose rays"" with canny, affecting musicianship, and it's nice that Caroline Kennedy's Peep-Bo gets more than her usual third-fiddle role when ""Braid the raven hair"" is sung as a duet.Veteran Simon Masterton-Smith (pictured left) plays the Mikado as a big man light on his feet, and throwaway in his punishments; the compulsory choruses to his big number are amusing. And Strobel, looking every inch the part as the dragon betrothed, manages to make her brief moment of pathos in the Act I finale - supported by backing group, good idea - so touching that I wonder why her Act II soliloquy got axed, the only casualty apart from that ladies' chorus. From the first, pianola-precise pentatonics of the Eaton-Young Piano Duo, we know the pace is in safe musical hands, and you can almost hear Sullivan's ingenious orchestration in some of their subtler touches. If Gregor Donnelly's designs were only allowed - budgeted? - to go beyond two screens and a selection of ungainly red boxes, and to find a bit more unity in the costumes (though red and black almost bind things together), the production might create a stronger world of its own. But the fact that the cast does all the work without props or clunking gags speaks for itself. The fine ensemble is certainly enough to send you out beaming from this great Savoy masterpiece.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/mikado-charles-court-opera-kings-head-theatre,4
654,"Duke Bluebeard's Castle, Philharmonia Orchestra, Salonen, Royal Festival Hall",Duke Bluebeard's Castle,Philharmonia Orchestra,2011-11-04,Edward Seckerson,"Sometimes the most disturbing images exist only in our imaginations - and so the questions posed in the preface to Bartók’s operatic masterpiece Duke Bluebeard’s Castle become especially pertinent: “Where did this happen - outside or within? Where is the stage - outside or within?” The answers, surely, lie “within”, making the prospect of a “semi-staged” climax to Esa-Pekka Salonen’s Philharmonia Bartók series, Infernal Dance, a potentially troubling one.There was a “set” - a grey-walled shell and a pendulous shard-like mobile whose mere presence had one fearing the worst. And so the first half of the concert was played out within the environs of Bluebeard’s domain, as it were, with Debussy’s languorous faune stretched out in what remained of the afternoon sun. Odd auditory reflections from the Bluebeard set threw the textures into sharper relief, rather too brightly lit for the softer edges of the music to work their magic. There was nothing vague about the impressionism here. Samuel Coles’ gleaming solo flute had 20/20 vision.And then the start of the evening’s Bartók: the home-away-from-home Third Piano Concerto with Yefim Bronfman, a sometime Bluebeard of the keys, robbing the piece of its highly personalised identity. His playing displayed all the lyricism of the abstracted set around him with the beauty of those tender Baroque allusions (the earthy acquiring airs) rendered sternly anonymous. At one point in the piece a scary spasm in the stage lighting came upon us like some divine intervention threatening to plunge us prematurely into the stygian gloom of the Duke’s castle. Or was it a certain lack of electricity in Bronfman’s playing?And so, out of the post-interval darkness came Juliet Stevenson pronouncing that “the curtain of (our) eyelids” be raised revealing… what exactly? Is this piece stageable in any shape or form? Does movement or indeed any visual information add anything at all? Isn’t this the theatre of psychology, the dark heart of human desire? Nick Hillel (director), David Edwards and David Holmes (staging and lighting design) projected, in every sense, a series of unremarkable images – condensation running down cold surfaces, blood seeping through pierced cloth – but words and music unlock our collective imaginations here and our deepest fears produce the most unsettling images. We don’t need to see anything.But we need to hear – undistracted – and what we were hearing was a quite superb and highly strung exposition of Bartók’s miraculous score from Salonen and the Philharmonia. That score imagines what lies behind each of the doors of Bluebeard’s psyche with such precise and extraordinary orchestral colorations that seeing somehow impedes hearing and inhibits imagination. As to the physical, the merest suggestion of a look or a touch or (surely never) an embrace between Judith and Bluebeard is too much information. Their presence must remain as intangible as the rasping sighs which emanate from the castle walls.John Tomlinson and Michelle DeYoung were vocally so commanding as to render “choreography” entirely superfluous. Tomlinson’s cavernous voice seemed to embody the very interior world of his castle - its sadness, darkness, emptiness - his Hungarian so vivid and expressive in itself that it became another sonority in Bartók's aural palette. He was quite extraordinary.Musically stunning, then - and how paradoxical that the single most sensational moment in the piece - the opening of the fifth door onto Bluebeard’s domains - should quite literally have blinded us from seeing anything.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/duke-bluebeards-castle-philharmonia-orchestra-salonen-royal-festival-hall,
655,"La Sonnambula, Royal Opera",La Sonnambula,Royal Opera,2011-11-03,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"Imagine what John Cleese might have done with the tale of a slutty sleepwalker who finds herself staying at a packed provincial guest house? Bellini doesn't even touch on farce, let alone psychological investigation. He instead follows the archetypal bel canto formula: dramatic thinness and vocal display. That La sonnambula doesn't even for one second pretend that it is anything other than a vehicle for showy pyrotechnics (something that was underlined in last night's overly literal Royal Opera House revival) means that one sits through the dramatic torpor with remarkable good humour.Theatrical boredom was also alleviated by a rather lovely (if a little inflexible) set from director-designer Marco Arturo Marelli. The 1970s Alpine retreat was a pleasing symphony of cold greys, whites and blues, blushing in each act as the sun set and the moon rose. No attempt was made to exploit the numerous opportunities for cleverness. Little attempt was even made to make sense of the theatrical basics. But off-piste activity was to be had. From the voices.No sooner had the curtain lifted than Lisa (Elena Xanthoudakis), in a fit of wedding envy, was reaching up into the stratospheric heights in self-pitying Bridget Jones moaning. Amina (Eglise Gutierrez), her maid, is about to marry. And in the numerous ecstatic, pitch-perfect hops, skips and jumps of her ravishing coloratura, Gutierrez made sure we knew it.The challenges for Amina keep coming as she sleepwalks into a compromising embrace with a fellow hotel guest, Count Rodolfo (a solid if spunkless Michele Pertrusi), and sends her Elvino (Celso Albelo) into a spin. Gutierrez delivered all her vocal fireworks in an exquisitely sleepy state, engaging in some extremely fine legato bel canto. Her dreamy voice, coloured by the small warming palpitations of her vibrato, aided this fluidity. Most astonishing, however, was how she was able to deliver all the highest roulades and trills (on Cs, Ds and E flats) sotto voce or fortissimo. Most singers can only do one or the other.Next to this Albelo's stiff, strained, warthoggy contributions as Elvino were about as welcome as a police siren. Xanthoudakis continued to offer a first-class vocal slalom throughout. A revelation came in the wise and powerful interventions from Amina's mother, Elizabeth Sikora's Teresa. Listening to her flawless vocal technique, watching her considered and confidant stage presence, glorying in her lusty voice - suggesting a woman half her age - I was left wondering why I've only just heard of this extraordinary lady.The chorus's dumb intrusions (never a strong point for the bel canto brigade) are kept to a minimum, though last night - which saw the choir on unusually poor form - it was not nearly minimal enough for me. Conductor Daniel Oren did what he had to do, but no more. There were some lovely small solo contributions from the flutes and horns. But without the contributions from the female vocalists I might have somnambulated out the door.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-sonnambula-royal-opera,
656,"Castor and Pollux, English National Opera",Castor and Pollux,English National Opera,2011-10-25,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"The English National Opera were taking quite a gamble with last night's Rameau premiere. The daunting basics? A 250-year-old French opera that hasn't yet been properly adopted by its homeland, let alone by Britain; a mildly autistic mythological plot that eulogises the ordered loyalties of brotherly love over the messy complications of sexual desire; and a director, Barrie Kosky, Intendant at Berlin's Komische Oper, where you're not really allowed to break wind without the help of a dramaturg.Katrin Lea Tag's minimalist set took the gamble one step further. From start to finish, the entire intergalactic drama of Castor and Pollux - the visits to heaven, hell, the battlefield and starry firmament - was shoved into a large plywood box. The space revealed itself to be a cleverer contraption than at first seemed possible. It behaved like a Petri dish in which Kosky could closer inspect the relationships and emotions of the leading foursome. Within its four bare walls, each and every knot in the tangled sexual interplay between the sisters Télaïre (Sophie Bevan) and Phébé (Laura Tatulescu) and the brothers Castor (Allan Clayton) and Pollux (Roderick Williams), was able to be investigated with greater clearity than ever.Yet what Kosky gave with one hand, he took with the other. Scenes of great clarity were intermittently dashed against the rocks of pretension. A smorgasbord of cockily obscure, pseudo-artistic interventions (mostly second-rate Maurizio Cattelan) collared us: a huge smoking slope of earth, a Stasi Jupiter in top hat and veil, and more sliding plywood walls than you could shake a Pole at. Several tableaux left their imprint: the eternal panty-drop striptease of the heavenly pleasures, the fingering of Phébé on an ash mound, the dance of the disembodied office workers, the slow-mo silent screams from the inhabitants of hell. But mostly I was left wondering whether this was where Frieze Art Fair had dumped their unsold leftovers.Rameau withstood it all. In fact, he proved more than an able partner to Amanda Holden's revelatory translation and Kosky's intermittent psychological sculpting. The endlessly choppy emotional surface of the recitative duetted beautifully with the traumas on stage, especially when Castor finally betrays Télaïre and leaves her for his brother. In Pollux's endless journeying, Rameau hints at all manner of worldly and otherworldly scenarios. To this overflowing cupboard of allusive musical colour Kosky could only add an untidy sock drawer of ideas.The singers were extraordinary. With Kosky having whimsically translated the gradations of human emotion into various sprints (smacking into walls, running in circles etc), Sophie Bevan was forced on a small marathon as Télaïre. It didn't stop her from delivering a flawless vocal performance, technically, stylistically and emotionally. Laura Tatulescu's embittered Phébé was the ideal foil, both voice and presence beautifully shaded.Roderick Williams's emotional journey as Pollux from the divine bouncer to the haunted and hell-bound lost soul was done with great conviction. Allan Clayton's Castor was astounding, his piercingly ornamented aria, ""Séjour de l'éternelle paix"", one of the highlights of the evening.One could overlook the odd accident from conductor Christian Curnyn, such was the quality - lean, shapely and clean - otherwise of the orchestral playing, particularly from the burring bassoons and breezy period flutes. Perhaps a little more emotion could have been extracted. No doubt that will come as they familiarise themselves with the piece. One couldn't overlook the raggedness and skew-whiff balancing of the choir, however.No matter. No one gets Rameau right from top to toe on a first go. What's most important is that, despite the flaws, it worked. Rameau was shown to be doable. The original 1737 version, with its more measured and satisfying emotional arc, might have worked a little better. Happily, a few of the more highly prized numbers from the earlier score were snuck back into the 1754 revision we heard. Still, a very decent first showing for Rameau at the ENO.

657,"Don Pasquale, Glyndebourne on Tour",Don Pasquale,Glyndebourne on Tour,2011-10-24,David Nice,"Who would have thought that in a comic opera by Donizetti, least orchestra-indulgent of Italian composers, the conductor could be paramount? While Mariame Clément's production frisks around the soft edges of the stock opera buffa plot - sometimes imaginatively, elsewhere a bit superfluously - and four classy singers ensure Glyndebourne pleasures at a high level, it's Enrique Mazzola down in the pit who sets a vital pace: culling any slack business from his cast, according elegantly with the backdate to the 18th century and razor-sharp enough to keep us interested when plot and music threaten to self-repeat.What simple pleasure, all the same, to see a Don Pasquale where the characters aren't reduced to distant dolls by an overwhelming set in a larger theatre - Jonathan Miller's toy house at Covent Garden - or pushed into unfunny sitcom style. Glyndebourne, where this production is still to be seen until next Saturday, is the perfect size for the nimble four-hander (a chorus is amusingly accommodated in Act III as 18th-century theatre-going, picnicking society [pictured right] rather than the stipulated servants; and the tour venues should fit it well, too.Julia Hansen's designs show us three rooms on a revolve: the salon where jippy-hearted old Don Pasquale reclines, tended by a housekeeper with reasonable hopes of becoming the missus; the messy bedroom where nephew Ernesto sprawls; and the room with a bath where his supposed intended Norina sits at a desk cynically writing (rather than reading, as Donizetti and his librettist originally intended) romantic novels. Soon she's to be whisked into a slip of a plot to play the demure ""Sofronia"", proposed as Don Pasquale's wife - the uncle will wed in pique at his nephew's refusal to marry into money - who turns termagent in a farcical trick as old as Plautus.Clearly the dark lynchpin in Clément's very French re-imagining is Doctor Malatesta, and it would have been reasonable to expect Ukrainian baritone Andrei Bondarenko, after his charismatic in a BBC Cardiff Singer of the World competition many thought he should have won, to be the star of the show. He's not, though he does spin a lovely line when allowed. Surprisingly, it's the stage presence which is a little wanting; the nervous hands are a giveaway, and he's an inch away from relaxing into the most delicious of all the comic duets, the Act III Malatesta-Pasquale Catherine wheel, as personably as Jonathan Veira (the pair pictured above). Here's a comic (bass) baritone now in his vintage prime. The big eyes which Veira uses without resort to mugging, the relaxed body language, the impeccable delivery of Italian recitative: all these raise him to the level of the consummate buffo performer.Ainhoa Garmendia comes close in one of the most spirited soprano roles in the book (such a change from some of Donizetti's wilting opera seria heroines). The soubrette-ish performance is more or less what you'd expect in the role, but doesn't quite rise to the edgier implications of Clément's premise that Norina is involved in a sort of liaison dangereuse conspiracy with Malatesta, the lover she skips off with at the end. This is a spin you can take or leave; it doesn't make much sense to me when the sparkling score speaks nothing but happy reconciliation.Clément's slightly hard-edged 18th-century setting, working overtime to fill in any gaps in the simple-minded tale, throws up a few happy ideas in Act III, where it seems that we, along with elegant society - the Glyndebourne Chorus, nimble in a great little set piece originally written for a cohort of servants, and kitted out in costumes that must have cost a bomb - are watching an opera within an opera, and where the pretty Watteau-esque fête champêtre against Tiepolo-blue skies marks the score's last-minute concession to a romanticism that Clément will soon strip away.And this is carried, musically, by one of the prettiest tenore di grazia voices I've heard for a long time. Like most tenors today, Sicilian Enea Scala (pictured right with Garmendia) looks good, but it's his singing, of world-class stylishness, which is a revelation. Perhaps it wouldn't carry in a bigger house, but what of that when the gracefulness and ease are so ideal for Donizetti's very specific demands? So the perfect tenor, along with Veira's easy comic charm and Mazzola's impeccable string-pulling down in the pit, is what I'll take away from a performance well up to the standards of anything in the main Glyndebourne season. May the house find an ensemble as good when it goes for the supposed upgrade.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/don-pasquale-glyndebourne-tour,
658,"The Queen of Spades, Opera North",The Queen of Spades,Opera North,2011-10-23,graham Rickson,"This new production, Opera North’s first, sounds fantastic – Tchaikovsky’s lurid colours are brilliantly painted, and the compact dimensions of the Grand Theatre mean that the big orchestral tuttis have a devastating impact. Richard Farnes’s conducting is faultless – this music really swoons, screams and seduces. And despite the occasionally overpowering volume, Farnes never lets his orchestral playing drown out the singers.The piece is given in an excellent, witty English translation – sung with such clarity that the surtitles feel unnecessary. Tchaikovsky adapted and expanded Pushkin's short story as his source, constructing a richly detailed three-act work revolving around the military engineer Herman’s quest for a diabolical secret with which he can always win at cards. And in an opera all about gambling, taking risks and seizing chances, it’s a shame that some elements of Neil Bartlett’s historically apt staging fall a little flat – you leave craving a little more gaudiness, edginess and Expressionist sleaze. Perhaps it’s the fault of Kandis Cook’s elegant, spare set design. It looks a little too austere and monochrome, only coming into its own when things become more intimate, as when Herman confronts the Countess in her bedroom.The busier scenes work beautifully – the opera’s opening, complete with immaculately drilled childrens’ chorus, is flawless. Goose pimples are also raised as the chorus announce the Empress of Russia’s arrival in the second act, while the funeral procession which opens Act III is visually stunning. There are so many good things – most notably the claustrophobic final 20 minutes which at last do justice to Tchaikovsky’s dark musical and dramatic imagination, as Herman tries his luck on the card table. As the doomed Herman, Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts sounds marvellous but isn’t always dramatically convincing. There’s an appealing pit-bull-like truculence about his persona which has you rooting for him, but he seems ill at ease, shuffling nervously. Orla Boylan as Lisa seems similarly uncomfortable, despite a similarly ravishing voice. The love scenes tick the requisite boxes, but don’t always take wing.It’s the supporting roles which steal the evening, William Dazely’s cuckolded Prince Yeletsky a far more winning stage presence than Lloyd-Roberts, matched by Jonathan Summers’s engaging Tomsky. Best of all is Dame Josephine Barstow’s turn as the countess (pictured right, with Lloyd-Roberts). She’s still effortlessly charismatic, her voice largely intact as she enters her eighth decade. Even when she’s tucked away at the side of Act II’s crowded ballroom scene, you can’t help staring at her. And to see her near the end of the same act minus wig and ball gown is a chilling moment. The voice dies down to a whisper, and the audience is silent. In places it’s a thrilling evening’s entertainment - marvel at Tchaikovsky’s glorious music and the high-class contributions from orchestra and chorus. But this piece needs to feel more dangerous and desperate than it does here.Watch the trailer for Opera North's The Queen of Spades",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/queen-spades-opera-north,
659,"Der Fliegende Holländer, Royal Opera",Der Fliegende Holländer,Royal Opera,2011-10-19,alexandra Coghlan,"Whether or not we believe Wagner’s retrospective rebranding of the opera as a prototype music-drama, “a complete, unbroken web”, Der Fliegende Holländer reliably makes for a vivid evening’s entertainment. Which makes it all the more strange that this is only the work’s third outing at the Royal Opera in almost 20 years. Animated by the push-pull of contrary rhythms and the slapping, spitting bite of the brass, Wagner’s compact score is almost overburdened by its drama, something understood by Tim Albery’s quietly effective production which sees the work undergo something of a sea change.Greeted favourably when it debuted in 2009, the production relocates the folk tale of the arrogant mariner, forever condemned to wander the oceans unless he can be redeemed by the true love of a woman, to a non-specific contemporary setting. While a beautiful three-masted ship is present on stage, this model is dwarfed by the contemporary abstraction of a vessel that designer Michael Levine creates, its sweeping metallic curves by turns cradling the fragile action and then rearing up to hurl the Dutchman and his doomed Senta to their separate fates.The psychological authenticity of the crazed fantasist Kampe creates in Senta comes at a vocal priceWe open, however, with one of Albery’s few missteps. The fretting exposed strings and horn cries that announce the Overture summon movement from the gauze curtain shielding the stage. For its full 10 minutes, and through the music’s many mood swings, the storm rages on in the curtain, accompanied eventually on a too-swift rotation by a searchlight that rakes blindingly over the audience. The 20th-century equivalent of those 18th-century operatic wave machines, this filler of a gesture is unworthy of what follows, distracting from Wagner’s score while adding little by way of drama.The 2009 staging marked the return of Bryn Terfel to Wagner after his withdrawal from the Ring, his tormented, impassioned Dutchman central to Albery’s vision. While his Senta (Anja Kampe) returns for this revival, Terfel’s ghostly waders are here filled by the Latvian Egils Silins, a late replacement for Falck Struckmann. While his “Die frist ist um” didn’t quite find the bleak place it needed, interiorising the burden Albery heaps visually on him in the coil of rope that weighs python-like around his shoulders, he nevertheless found the tragedy that the composer recognised among the ironies of Heine’s satirical tale. His inability to unbend either physically or emotionally (aided in its stylised stiffness by David Finn’s Gothic lighting) gained pathos in the love duet, where Albery’s direction freezes the Dutchman and Senta to their separate spaces even as Wagner warms the music to boiling point.While some will be delighted by Kampe (pictured right with Silins), by her fearless attack of the extreme singing this role requires, the psychological authenticity of the crazed fantasist she creates in Senta comes at a vocal price. We see (and hear) the big fences coming, and while truth demands that she hurl herself at them with little care for beauty, at times the effect often crosses the line between artful disarray and actual lack of control. Her Ballad remains beautifully judged, a disquieting foil to the spinning song (wittily translated to a Western European garment factory).Also returning is John Tessier’s Steersman, whose legato makes a jewel of his love song, glittering like the Dutchman’s treasures against the matter-of-fact Daland (a rather under-characterised Stephen Milling). Endrik Wottrich makes an equally unremarkable job of Erik, his voice giving way in rather spectacular style under the weight of his closing confrontation with Senta, but his tensions were merely the most magnified of the evening’s singing as a whole.The ensemble shuddered like Wagner’s stormy ocean, with Silins and the otherwise strong male chorus among the most at odds with the orchestra. Jeffrey Tate, striving for the more deliberate control and pacing that would make sense of the Dresden ending, found a no-place in his tempi that lacked either poise or real direction, creating unsightly tears in the musical cloth. Doubtless it will all settle, but with the complexities (and often noise) of Levine’s set still not fully worked out either, the effect was scrappy and distracting.Issues of execution aside, Albery’s production remains a strong one, its muted simplicity daring to make something “rich and strange” out of Wagner’s awkward drama. This isn’t quite the impassioned love story Der Fliegende Holländer sometimes can be (and many will take issue with the ending), but in its place we get a meditation on human isolation and yearning that runs altogether deeper.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/der-fliegende-holl%C3%A4nder-royal-opera,
660,"Xerxes, Britten Theatre, Royal College of Music",Xerxes,Britten Theatre,2011-10-08,alexandra Coghlan,"“Morning at the airfield: King Xerxes admires the new Spitfire, which he hopes will transform his continental campaign.” If the title – emphatically Xerxes rather than Serse – hadn’t already given the game away, the synopsis for English Touring Opera’s newest Handel production makes it quite clear that we’re not in Kansas (or Italy, or Persia for that matter) any more. The scene is the Battle of Britain and ruler Xerxes is doing his best impersonation of one of those dashing young men in his flying machine. The minute he slips off his goggles and delivers “Ombra mai fu” – reconceived as an ode to his beloved aeroplane – you just know it’s going to be a good evening.Aided by the cogent wit of Nicholas Hytner’s classic English translation, director James Conway strips away orientalist issues and pantaloons alike, and plunges us instead into a wartime montage of silhouetted fighter planes, neatly dressed nurses and mackintoshed black-marketeers. Handel’s already rather free-form take on opera seria (“taking the serious out of seria” as Hytner inevitably has it), here blossoms in the swift pacing that makes hard-fought dogfights out of four-square recitatives.The plot is tortuous, even by Handel’s standards, and its inherent silliness finds expression in a sort of camp menace that owes a debt to Dr Strangelove. At the root of this is Xerxes himself – an imposing figure indeed in Julia Riley’s hands, standing tall above Clint van der Linde’s Arsamenes and sporting enough Brylcreem to glaze the entire male cast of The Godfather. Comfortably masculine in the role, and displaying – against strong competition – the most assured vocal delivery of the evening, the danger here was in her making a wronged hero out of this peevish ruler.Giving the weight of sincerity to Xerxes’s rather sudden passion for the beautiful Romilda (despite the best attempts of a Carry On RAF-style phallic windsock), Riley’s delivery matched for dynamism every visual explosion during “Crude furie”, and brought brutality as well as anguish to her climactic encounter with her reluctant beloved. Her full, dramatic tones contrasted well with Van der Linde’s rather more hollow countertenor – flexible and agile enough if occasionally pushed a little hard for climactic effect.Romilda’s tightly wound fidelity can make her hard to warm to, but Laura Mitchell’s (pictured right with Van der Linde's Arsmenes) musicality and range of expression carried her slightly implausible adoration for Arsamenes, while Conway’s direction gave Mitchell’s Romilda (together with Paula Sides’s Atalanta) one of the finest set pieces in the form of a pyjama-clad catfight between the two rivals.English Touring Opera has built its success on the talent of young British singers, and this production – housed in a sympathetically sized theatre – was a true celebration of this, a real ensemble effort with not a weak performance among the lot. We saw real dramatic range from Sides’s Atalanta, out of whose coquettish bitchery grew the simple sadness of her closing. Rachel Lloyd gamely emoted as rejected princess Amastris, while Nicholas Merryweather’s comedy henchman Elviro (pictured left) and his silk stockings was all personality and vocal pizzazz.Driving proceedings from the pit was Jonathan Peter Kenny. Grinning and bopping along, his tempi were always on the poised side of sprightly, and just occasionally it would have been nice to hear a bit more urgency. The Old Street Band didn’t lack for edge in their attack, but at Kenny’s measured pace just a little more languor from the upper strings would have gilded the slower arias, matching the work of the singers.The association between ETO and Handel, cemented in 2009’s Handelfest, is a fruitful one. We’ve had a fair bit of traditional interpretation from the company over the years, but it’s wonderful to see so cheeky and altogether more relaxed a production from them. Xerxes, whether for its more modern structural sensibility or simply its music, has attracted some classic productions which loom over any newcomers. Conway and ETO have taken Hytner’s legacy and made it their own. Handel will forever be classical music’s adopted Englishman, and it seems only fitting that he should have so thoroughly British a celebration here.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/xerxes-britten-theatre-royal-college-music,
661,"Katya Kabanova, Welsh National Opera",Katya Kabanova,Welsh National Opera,2011-10-08,stephen Walsh,"Katie Mitchell’s production of what many regard as Janáček’s greatest opera began life 10 years ago on the stage of Cardiff’s New Theatre; and there are times in this revival when you feel its director Robin Tebbutt’s yearning to be back in that constricted environment, so much better suited to the stifling world which destroys the work’s repressed, self-loathing heroine.“Marvellous sight, the Volga,” sings the schoolteacher Kudryash, pointing and spreading his arms. But Mitchell walls them all up in what looks like a railway café without any train service (the programme synopsis calls it a boat station); and when they finally make it out through the garden gate, she crops the open space into a narrow aperture between sliding panels. Physical freedom, she tells us, is illusory when you’re trapped by your heart.It’s a modish, sometimes irritating way of stating the obvious. But it fits Janáček’s score, so monosyllabic and retentive. What are all those thumps and thuds and tight little ostinatos but an image of passion going nowhere? No wonder Katya’s imagination tends to fly off into dreamland; and no wonder the orchestral equivalent is the spiralling arpeggio and the lyrical phrase cut short. Opera is often about a man’s idea of a woman’s feelings (think of Puccini and Strauss); but I can’t call to mind a single work where the music catches the ebb and flow of one woman’s emotions as convincingly or as movingly (I daren’t say as accurately) as Janáček does in Katya Kabanova.Mitchell’s stage picture, cleverly designed by Vicki Mortimer, is consistent in its own way: all institutional interiors and waiting rooms. The Kabanovs have gone middle class and live in what looks like a converted Victorian school circa 1960. The conventions don’t work, of course: the shame of infidelity, the disbelief in lightning conductors, even perhaps the sadistic ferocity of mothers-in-law – these remote aspects of Ostrovsky’s rural Russia of the 1860s feel strained 100 years on.But individual portraits respond brilliantly. Amanda Roocroft’s Katya, well turned out and well-to-do, seems doubly imprisoned by her smart horror of a mother-in-law (Leah-Marian Jones), who looks young enough to be her husband’s sister, and is almost certainly her lover’s uncle’s mistress. This Katya can meet abuse with dignity; and she sings with a radiant intensity that is almost in the end self-defeating. Why not, after all, simply decamp to Siberia with this eligible, attractive young bachelor of a Boris Grigorievich? The answer, of course, is part of her fantasy life; “It’s like standing on the edge of a cliff,” she explains, “with someone pushing you off.” Nothing in elopement is ever quite so exciting. And for him, of course, there’s the tricky question of the bequest he might lose if he upsets Uncle Dikoy…Lothar Koenigs conducts a superb, uninhibited performance of a score that has many hidden perils of balance and pacing (though breaking a timpani skin, as happened at the end of the first act, is surely a new hazard). And the cast is uniformly excellent. Roocroft, still in fine vocal fettle, seems to have acquired a still greater stage presence than even she had before, while opposite her Peter Wedd offers a just sufficiently attractive portrait of love from a distance held back by the material here and now. (Roocroft and Wedd pictured right.)There’s more passion, perhaps, in Varvara’s lover Kudryash, beautifully sung by Andrew Rees; but in his case it’s a passion for enquiry that one feels might bode no good for affairs of the heart in the long term. Janáček cleverly suggests that, either way, romantic love is a dangerous game. But perhaps Patricia Orr’s Varvara won’t mind too much. She’s happy with her midnight swims and her lightheaded contempt for her foster mother (what is it about Janáček and these oblique relationships?).Jones’s svelt, if charmless, Kabanicha is a highly original portrait of a role usually played as an old harridan; it perhaps makes more sense of Clive Bayley’s also somewhat less than doddery Dikoy, who likes his women jackbooted; but it creates a slight problem for Stephen Rooke’s prematurely white-haired Tikhon, who certainly doesn’t need a youthful Gauleiterin for a mother. Somehow in Janáček’s ever-complicated world of twisted ancestry this all works. But it’s a great tribute to the performers that it does.WNO’s new artistic director, David Pountney, spoke briefly before curtain-up about Sir Charles Mackerras, dedicating the performance to his memory. It was a touching and apt gesture. Mackerras was responsible for Janáček’s discovery in this country, and he presided as music director over a golden era in this company’s history. Pountney, himself a Janáček specialist of distinction, is a good bet for another one.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/katya-kabanova-welsh-national-opera-0,
662,"The Marriage of Figaro, English National Opera",The Marriage of Figaro,English National Opera,2011-10-06,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"Fiona Shaw's new production of The Marriage of Figaro for the ENO focuses on the theme of entrapment. Her first victim? A noisy bee. Don Basilio finds himself so harassed by its buzzing, he confines it to the body of a harpsichord. Magically, a few seconds later, the low hum reappears - on strings and bassoons.It's classic Shaw: a clever, symbolic, funny and possibly superfluous bit of theatrical punnery. She doesn't overdo the anomie. The political and class dimensions are but lightly touched upon. But there is certainly a nasty tension to the Almaviva household. Were they as upset about the tatty walls as I was? The striated, white, corrugated plastic sets might have been brilliant if one could see through them. You couldn't. So what was the point? I guess that I should have been grateful that at least they revolved. Opera sets need movement like cakes need buttercream.It was a masterstroke. The intermittent, squally run-arounds - the dashing through servants quarters, kitchens, sculleries, past butchers blocks and clothes chests - were a lovely counterpart to the whirlwind orchestral accompaniment. If Shaw rather overloaded the place with dead bulls' skulls (hinting not so subtly at the possibility that this was a Casanova's graveyard), and lots of prosaic but no doubt meaningful projections, her ensemble work and eye for telling details more than made up for it. We open on a Figaro, not measuring his bed, but counting the contents of his latest pay check. Susanna sarcastically admires her dowdy bridal hat. Not faithful, but so right. There's more social precision - head-slapping precision - later. Of course the paralytically shy teenager Cherubino would insist he sing his song with his audience's backs turned. How has no one thought of that? There's perhaps a little too much crotch activity on the whole. (Men really don't do as much of that as you think, Fiona.) And she obviously still hasn't got past the smashing-stuff-up school of how to portray anger.The positives were aided by a singularly extraordinary group of actors. The women were especially fine. Devon Guthrie's Susanna was a class act, able to transform her mood from sark to spite in a flash. Her voice was a rich delight and worked beautifully in tandem with Lucy Schaufer's superb Marcellina. Kathryn Rudge's slightly tinny-toned Cherubino was more interesting from a theatrical perspective than from a vocal point of view. They were all slightly eclipsed by young stand-in Elizabeth Llewellyn. As Countess Almaviva, she displayed an incredible phlegmatic calm stepping in at the last moment (yesterday to be precise) to cover for an indisposed Kate Valentine. Save an unexplored sotto voce, she sounded like she was made for the role. The sadness that she shows in her opening aria belied the brutishness of the man (Roland Wood) that she was married to. Her shock at being mounted from behind by the Count (because he thinks she's Susanna) was plain to see. For the first time that I've ever watched this opera, I really wasn't sure she would take him back - her bags were packed. In a way I wished she hadn't. I wish Shaw had followed the argument of her production to its logical conclusion: divorce. The men were menacing. I was quite genuinely terrified of what Iain Paterson's Figaro might do following his threatening ""Se vuol ballare"". Roland Wood lacked presence as the Count. Everyone and everything - very much the drab set (Peter McKintosh), the uninspired lighting (Jean Kalman) and Paul Daniels's smudgy conducting - needed more colour. Either that, or the stark route offered by the set might have been explored more thoroughly. Stuck in a halfway house, it was neither fish nor fowl. The garden scene was neither plastic and brutal nor fragrant and crepuscular, just a little awkward. The Countess's Act II bedroom scene was neither menacing nor farcical. Details had been sculpted but the general shape hadn't, which made for an interesting but ultimately not entirely satisfying night. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/marriage-figaro-english-national-opera,
663,"Ruddigore, Opera North",Ruddigore,Opera North,2011-10-01,graham Rickson,"Revived with almost indecent haste, Jo Davies’s 2010 production of Gilbert and Sullivan’s Ruddigore now feels even more polished and slick. Slickness is not a derogatory term here; this staging hits the spot in pretty much every way – musically, dramatically and visually.Davies’s shrewdest move is to shift Gilbert’s creaky satire on the excesses of Victorian melodrama forward to the 1920s, a period now more closely associated with the genre – think silent cinema, big moustaches and shiny top hats. There are also several nice nods to 1930s horror films, and a witty sequence of scratchy slides shown just before the curtain rises. These give us the operetta’s back story – that of the cursed line of Murgatroyd baronets, each successive title holder condemned to commit a serious crime each day or face an agonising death. Structurally it’s an unbalanced work – Act I is overlong and too discursive, followed by a tighter second half which concludes nonsensically and a little too abruptly. The plot is full of holes. But it’s still very, very funny – watch this Ruddigore as a series of brilliant set pieces and you’ll leave the theatre immensely satisfied.  Davies’s teasing hints of the drama to come are so delicious that there’s a rather long wait before the action really kicks off – at the point where the villainous Sir Despard (a superb Richard Burkhard) makes his dastardly entrance through a Punch and Judy tent. His elder brother Ruthven, having faked his own death and now living quietly under an assumed name, is unmasked, leading to a beautifully choreographed wedding scene where he is suddenly forced to take on the cape, the cane and the top hat, abandoning his bride to be for a life of crime. Grant Doyle is a joy as the imposter, best of all in his scenes with his foster brother Dick Dauntless – especially during an extended sequence where he wins the attention of village sweetheart Rose Maybud by describing what Dick might really have been getting up to whilst at sea. Dick’s entrance leads to a nicely choreographed re-enactment of a French naval battle played out by flag-waving bridesmaids (pictured above right). It’s marvellous to watch, and Hal Cazalet is as agile vocally as he is with his feet. Amy Freston as Rose convinces as a woman vainly trying to lead her life according to the advice contained in an etiquette manual, subtly unbuttoning and loosening up before our eyes.Act II’s technical challenges are surmounted with ease - notably the moment where the Murgatroyd portraits descend from their picture frames to harass Sir Ruthven, too mild-mannered to commit atrocities more serious than forging cheques. Richard Stilgoe has provided yet more updated lyrics – mentioning phone hacking, Greek debt and Sally Bercow. It’s gorgeously lit by Anna Watson – I’ve rarely seen outdoor skies look so natural. And it’s conducted by the remarkable, precocious John Wilson, lifting every rhythm and pacing each patter song to perfection. Bad Gilbert and Sullivan productions are pure torture. This one is lavish, affectionate and witty.Watch the trailer for Ruddigore",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/ruddigore-opera-north-0,
664,"Madam Butterfly, Mid Wales Opera",Madam Butterfly,Mid Wales Opera,2011-09-24,stephen Walsh,"There are several types of garden opera, and there are also, happily, several types of cinema opera. You can rustle your Werthers through a relay from the Met and endure the touchy-feely interviews with panting mega-sopranos just out of Verdi’s “Sempre libera”; or you can pick up a small touring company like Mid Wales Opera at the Pontardawe Arts Centre or the Aberdare Coliseum, and watch real opera sung by human beings in unhelpful surroundings. I know which I prefer; but then I have a weakness for adaptability. And this MWO Madam Butterfly, which I caught up with at the Roses Theatre in Tewksbury, is a prime example of the genre. Local theatres rarely help singers and they practically never help orchestras. Like most of its kind, The Roses has dry acoustics and no pit, so that even the 11-piece band to which Lara Taylor has reduced Puccini’s refined and varied orchestra has a tendency to smother voices – or at least words – that are getting so little help from their surroundings. It goes without saying that the production is limited by the need to fit it into whatever space it may happen to encounter on its travels. In fact Madam Butterfly tours well in this respect, because it only needs one set. But it remains Grand Opera, demanding biggish voices and grand gestures that sit oddly in this utterly un-posh, unfrilly environment. One remarkable thing about Stephen Barlow’s production and Yannis Thavoris’s designs is how well they get round these minor local difficulties. There is, it’s true, an element of the prosaic about Madam Butterfly: the whisky-drinking and the Americana, the sailor suits and the nice wife at the end. But Barlow stretches these details, with the lightest of tweaks, to enhance the sense of alienation and disillusion.  The most trivial aspect of this is the updating. We’re still in Nagasaki, but it’s the 1950s (yet again), and Cio-Cio San’s affectations of Westernism in Act II extend to a television set which (a nice provincial detail) she turns on as background, barely watching it. She assumes semi-occidental dress at this point, very logical, and highly effective later when – with ritual death approaching – she goes back oriental. The adaptation of the Japanese house as a suburban bungalow, with a PanAm poster in Japanese on the roof, is no director’s whim; it exactly follows the heroine’s emotional trajectory. The production’s main virtue, all the same, is its observation of detail. Not once is one distracted by smart or surreal imagery. Instead, care has gone into the things you don’t notice until they go wrong: the placing and movement of the singers, the way they face or occasionally touch each other, the moments of stillness. A symptom of this (I’m quite serious) is Charlotte Stephenson’s Kate Pinkerton, the best I’ve seen. She appears for only 10 minutes, sings about three lines, yet her role is crucial, and is usually muffed. This young singer exactly catches the shocked helplessness of the poor wife pitched into a tragic situation unforgivably created by the man she loves. Many other minutiae of the production are in this class. They add up to a subtle and touching performance which easily overcomes the topographical disadvantages. The casting is strong, if in some ways uneven. It’s a joy to hear Meeta Raval ([pictured above] a finalist in the recent Cardiff Singer of the World) in a complete role, which proves that she is not only a very talented singer but a vocal actress of considerable presence. The role is double cast, and Tewksbury would have heard Stephanie Corley but for illness; so that was one more piece of adaptability. As Pinkerton, Seán Ruane plays down the anti-Americanism, in line with Barlow’s insistence (in a very intelligent programme note) that the work isn’t essentially about imperialism, though it may be hard to escape that particular nuance (I’m still waiting, without excitement, for my first Butterfly in Baghdad). Ruane’s voice is too reedy for my taste, but he achieves the near impossible of an at least semi-sympathetic Pinkerton, despite the lack of warmth in the sound.  Wyn Pencarreg gives a solid, well-sung Sharpless, avuncular in intention, bungling in practice; Amy J Payne is a touching Suzuki, Stuart Haycock an excellent - that is loathsome - Goro, all obsequious smiles and cringing gestures. Simon Wilding (Bonze), Matthew Sprange (Yamadori) and Henry Grant Kerswell (Commissioner) put in brief but effective cameo appearances. Nicholas Cleobury conducts briskly, not lingering over those moments (especially at the end of Act II) where Puccini places a bit too much faith in plain sentiment, but making what richness is possible with such a small, albeit accomplished band. Lara Taylor goes, conventionally enough, for string and wind quintets plus electric piano with attachments, which condemns her to many awkward balances, too much flute and bassoon, not enough succulence. Perhaps the next arranger might try a bigger string group, a couple of woodwind, and more drastic orchestral effects on the keyboard. In the end, of course, the task is worthy but impossible. Puccini was a colourist as well as a melodist, and Cézanne on a postcard will never approach the real thing. Yet one can’t do without postcards.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/madam-butterfly-mid-wales-opera,
665,"The Passenger, English National Opera",The Passenger,English National Opera,2011-09-20,David Nice,"No two creative artists have a stronger right to make a valid statement about Auschwitz than a Polish-born composer who escaped his family's fate by fleeing to Russia, only to fall into another anti-Semitic trap, and a Polish writer whose clear-eyed transmutation of her three years in the camp inspired the opera. Neither, of course, guarantees the end result of great art. But Mieczysław Weinberg, Shostakovich's dearest disciple who died in 1996 without having seen his most cherished project staged, and novelist Zofia Posmysz, an elegant 88-year-old who having attended the Bregenz Festival world premiere last summer was with us again yesterday evening, could only have applauded the integrity of David Pountney's production on its London transfer.Is The Passenger, then, one of the 20th century's neglected masterpieces? After two viewings of the Bregenz production on DVD and now a first experience of what it can achieve in the opera house, I still don't know. There are, certainly, masterly scenes and memorable musical ideas on board a sometimes perilously freighted vessel. The visual metaphor for an action that is anything but symbolic reflects that. Johan Engels's set, colour co-ordinated with Marie-Jeanne Lecca's costumes, gives us the gleaming white ocean liner on which former SS overseer Annaliese Franz and her German diplomat husband are about to undergo a very bumpy ride, and beneath it the railway tracks, ovens and barracks of the camp where she once wielded control over the spiritually indomitable Marta - now (or is she?) a fellow-guest on the ship to Brazil.What starts out as Liese's dilemma slowly devolves to Marta. Those who try to forget are bound to crumble in the end; those who hold on fiercely to loving memory will prevail so long as there's breath in their bodies and tongues to bear witness. It sounds simplistic, but it works above all thanks to two superb lead performances and a host of telling ensemble contributions.A finer, more secure voice than Michelle Breedt's hasn't been heard at ENO. Since Bregenz, she's tried to further humanise the young camp overseer whose rejected need to be loved or admired by her charges warps into subtle psychological sadism. Breedt has always been totally in command of Liese the older woman with a conscience that won't let her evade the truth, hard as she tries. Giselle Allen, tackling the vocally unyielding role of tender-strong Marta for the first time, has a dramatically easier task, spirit-guided by the celesta which Weinberg uses to let her soul range free. She's strong enough to sustain the big memorial song Weinberg sets to bittersweet verses in Act II, and the Brittenish epilogue, Marta's final quiet triumph (pictured above with Allen and Breedt) many years later by the banks of a wide river, is as moving as it can be.As, indeed, are the many solos in the women's barracks, realistic in the sense that prayers and ballads would indeed have been sung by the inmates to keep each other's spirits alive. Simple as the text by Weinberg's preferred librettist Alexander Medvedev may be, its reiteration here of the human wish to imagine freedom rings true. The xylophone-accompanied scene in which naive but intuitive French girl Yvette (Rhian Lois) tries to teach old Polish believer Bronka (Rebecca de Pont Davies) the conjugation of 'to live' in her language hits its plaintive mark, and the silent heart of the opera, partisan Katya's unaccompanied Russian folksong, is beautifully if not totally idiomatically delivered by Julia Sporsén. Carolyn Dobbin, another voice of warmth and distinction, lights up the stage with the reassurances of Salonikan Jew Hannah (pictured below left with Allen's Marta).There's a correspondence here with the superb ensemble work of the Sovremennik Theatre's all-women scenes in its adaptation of Ginzberg's Into the Whirlwind. No doubt the intrusions of brutality are real enough, too, though you sometimes feel Weinberg is nailing one Shostakovich-indebted piledriving climax too many.Conductor Richard Armstrong does all that's required in terms of controlling the extremes - for Weinberg's style here is not so much a musical-dramatic unity with drive as a collage matching the right sounds to the right characters, never resorting to false pathos and always trying to honour his subjects. The pared-down moments are usually his most effective, with two exceptions: the soaring lyricism of Hannah's meeting with fiancé Tadeusz (baritone Leigh Melrose, strong as usual) down among the violins that need sifting for an instrument fit to play before the Kommandant, and the keynote scene in which Tadeusz, commanded to deliver the SS officers' favourite waltz, launches instead into the mighty Bach chaconne - keenly projected by Tadeusz-double Gonzalo Acosta.Otherwise, the men don't come off too well in Weinberg's world - nor, we guess, is craven diplomatic husband Walter (Kim Begley, rock-solid in another vocally overcooked part) supposed to; the tone of his exchanges with guilty Liese on the ship becomes increasingly, and rather uneasily, parodied by a contemptuous Weinberg. The male chorus's lugubrious ""wall of death"" chants feel a bit second-hand, evoking the Shostakovich of the memorial ""Babi Yar"" (13th) Symphony; but there's much, much more to The Passenger than just the voice of Weinberg's overwhelming master.His own voice still remains unclear to me; but what a feat this was in mid-1960s Soviet life, and what a debt of honour to the family ghosts who presumably never gave Weinberg a moment's peace. ENO have done him, and Posmysz - whose novella still cries out for English translation - very proud indeed. Honour them in turn by going to see a genuine labour of love.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/passenger-english-national-opera,
666,"Faust, Royal Opera",Faust,Royal Opera,2011-09-19,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"That Faust - Gounod's curdled Victorian dessert of an opera, an overwhipped melange of melodrama and misogyny, topped with grand 19th-century dollops of religiosity - achieves a level of profundity that at one stage nearly had me in tears is an absolute miracle. The miracle workers? David McVicar, whose revival production is unlikely to be bettered, and a clutch of leads that you'd normally need a pact with the devil - or at least a very amenable bank manager - to bring together.You don't have to update to pack a punch. That's what McVicar's straight-up French Second Empire setting proved immediately. René Pape's Mephistopheles (pictured below) appeared brandishing pen, paper and the eager ear of a 19th-century spiritual shopper before an aging Faust (Vittorio Grigolo), amid hoary clouds of dry ice, a sweeping curtain, Gothic vaults (for the churchy moments to come) and theatre arches (for the future iniquity). Simple, traditional theatricality at its best.It allowed conductor Evelino Pidò to high-kick us into Moulin Rouge-type bawdy cabaret (the Cabaret L'Enfer in this instance, with a cameo from the Eiffel Tower) in Act II. It gave free rein to a dark retelling of the Giselle parody of Act IV - pristine swan-shaped ballet dancers degenerating into cawing vultures before a drug-addled Faust. It also gave the singers a clear and believable motivational thread that they all followed with singular actorly professionalism.Grigolo's transformation from bitter, blind old man to bounding puppy (think Andrex) was fantastic. The thrill he felt to be unshackled of his tired old limbs, wrinkles and hunched back was only surpassed by our own exhilaration to be suddenly exposed to his full, fiery voice, which had up to that point been squeezed because of him being forced to old-man up. But this rush of excitement wasn't confined to Grigolo's appearances alone.An intoxicating quality came from all three male leads, whose power-play dominates the scenarios of the first two acts. In Grigolo we drank from the rapacious cup of youth. In Pape's Mephistopheles we imbibed a sound that was as darkly coloured as it was devious. In Dmitri Hvorostovsky's eminently eligible Valentin (pictured below),we got some of the most gloriously silken sounds of the night. His passionate rendition of ""O sainte medaille"" was rapturously received and had us wondering whether Mephistopheles and Faust hadn't perhaps met their match in this dashing Christian soldier.In any other company, one would have been more than grateful for Angela Gheorghiu's bold and pitch-perfect ability to clutch at the many high notes that appear in Marguerite's final scene. But in all the rich loveliness of tone, consonants were swallowed, the French accentation swamped and much of Pidò's pulse ignored, her vowelly voice lapping at the beats sloppily. The character of Marguerite too - a pretty unsympathetically vain creature whom we must learn to love somehow - needed more carefully expressed commitment for us to care for her all too melodramatic deterioration.Without the caustically choreographed Fourth Act ballet, in which an idyll and ideal is cleverly and violently dismantled, and Pape's amazingly alluring appearance in a dress (don't ask), we would have been sorely lacking a female angle. The smaller roles were a mixed bag, Carole Wilson delivering a classy turn as Marthe Schwertlein, but Michèle Losier was too pigeon-toed and not warbler-voiced enough as Siebel. As the opera progressed and a mirror image of the Royal Opera House auditorium was unveiled for Mephistopheles's lair, it became clearer what sort of Satan we are dealing with: the sexually ambiguous, hedonistic-chasing demon of the stage. And while he and his lascivious attendants (dancing a classic McVicar dance) undeniably lead things into hellish chaos, it is not clear that the flag-waving (and, boy, what a handsome Second Empire tricolor they were able to wave), religious and military crowds (delivered by a chorus on great form) are a happier alternative in the long run. But then that's why this Faust is so good. An opera whose ideas I've always thought weren't really worthy of a Channel 5 soap is made into something almost thought-provoking. A credit to McVicar and the cast.Faust continues at the Royal Opera House until 10 October",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/faust-royal-opera,
667,"Madam Butterfly, Opera North",Madam Butterfly,Opera North,2011-09-18,graham Rickson,"It’s easy to accuse opera companies in these straitened times of wanting to play safe. Opera North’s 2011-12 season is slightly slimmer than one would expect, but includes five new productions, and the revivals fully deserve their resurrection. Ruddigore is one. Tim Albery’s 1950s update of Madam Butterfly, first performed in 2007, is the other, and it's been given a classy resurrection here.Puccini’s best operas are disarmingly accessible and musically they’re brilliantly constructed.  The frighteningly young Italian conductor Daniele Rustioni takes charge for most of these performances, and initial responses are overwhelmingly positive – he’s not afraid to let the louder tuttis really rip, only occasionally obliterating the vocal lines. And Rustioni can really strip back and refine the textures when needed –  slow, exposed string lines carry immense pathos and wind solos sound lonely, yearning.It would be too simplistic to turn Butterfly into a leaden attack on US attitudes towards the wider world; here, it becomes a more universal tale of aggression, greed and sheer stupidity. Noah Stewart’s beaming Pinkerton behaves as if money and rank can get him whatever he chooses. He’s like an excitable child in a toyshop, filled with delight at his new house and his new bride, whom he treats like an exotic purchase. Stewart is so physically engaging – young, attractive, smiling – that you feel reluctantly inclined to sympathise with him. He also knows how to act, and his voice is young enough, fresh enough to make him credible. There’s a lovely moment near the end of Act 1 when Anne Sophie Duprels’s Cio-Cio San slowly changes into her nightgown, and Stewart stands at the other side of the stage, nervously, excitedly smoking a cigarette. He's an oaf with little respect or empathy for the culture which he’s buying into - but likeable for all that.Duprels (pictured right)projects the necessary youthful vulnerability as Cio-Cio San, and we wince as we see her transformation into an American housewife in Act 2. Like Stewart, she moves with as much conviction as she sings; even dramatically compelling when spreading flower petals in anticipation of Pinkerton's return. But the best performances are in supporting roles. Ann Taylor’s Suzuki is a wonderful, expressive foil to Duprels, and even better is Peter Savidge as the American consul Sharpless, whose every shrug suggesting the world-weary cynicism of the professional diplomat. Albery’s updating is unobtrusive and sensitive, making excellent use of Hildegard Bechtler’s set, with its shifting screens and muted colours. Ana Jebens’s costume designs help anchor a sense of time and place. Lighting is by Peter Mumford, who played a huge part in the success of Opera North’s recent semi-staged Das Rheingold. This is impressive stuff, and, despite the tragedy, very entertaining.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/madam-butterfly-opera-north,4
668,"Don Giovanni, Welsh National Opera",Don Giovanni,Welsh National Opera,2011-09-17,stephen Walsh,"After a summer of operas set in what might tactfully be called fancy locations, it comes as a mild shock to return to Wales and a Don Giovanni that actually takes the composer’s instructions as its starting-point. John Caird, whose first ever production for WNO a few years back was Don Carlos, revisits Spain without a qualm. He gives us heavily embossed ironwork and carved oak, he gives us cowled monks and cloaked aristocrats. And he captures without irony a world in which God and the Devil can be defied but not denied – a world forever teetering on the brink of moral and spiritual catastrophe.Mozart’s Seville is of course not only a place on the map – Leporello’s travelogue-catalogue notwithstanding. With its codes of honour, its dark passages, graveyards and hidden doorways, it has an almost Dante-esque quality of allegory. Abandon hope all ye who enter here. Yet Mozart called it a “dramma giocoso”, one which happily makes fun of its own terrors. “I’m also offering my protection,” Leporello remarks drily when caught groping the peasant girls at Zerlina’s wedding. “Fate is on my side,” Giovanni chortles as he embarks on his serenade with a monk as accompanist.Caird balances these opposed weights with better judgement than most directors who come to Mozart from the straight theatre, not to mention hit-musicals (Caird directed Les Misérables with the same designer, John Napier). This is a pacey, eventful production, very much abetted by Lothar Koenigs’s mobile, light-handed reading of the score. But it never overrides the crucial moments of stillness or ritual. Riskily, it takes Elvira as a figure of fun, but without soiling the essential dignity of her three great arias. Anna and Ottavio, by contrast, are allowed their solemnities without shrinking into the cardboard cut-outs of some stagings. The “dramma” and the “giocoso” flow well into one another, much helped by Napier’s quick-change walls and panels, which slide and revolve like Japanese screens, sometimes revealing emblematic details: the dancers at Giovanni’s party, the Commendatore’s dead-white marble statue, which replaces its living correlative at the moment of his death. Likewise at the end, Giovanni is dragged to hell through the huge central doorway, his agonies instantly frozen into a Rodin bronze. How to avoid anticlimax after that? enquires the programme-book interviewer. Of course, you don’t. The sextet is anticlimax – the only human response to hellfire. Like Zerlina and Masetto, we all go home to supper.Musically this is a fairly strong evening, though not for the first time in the past year or so with this company there are one or two curious castings. Nuccia Focile is a brilliant artist, but she was never cut out for Elvira: the voice is too soubrettish, too light and silvery. Claire Ormshaw, a lively, bouncy Zerlina, could do with greater warmth in the lower registers – more prominent here than in the other soprano roles. Her “Batti, batti” and “Vedrai, carino” are touchingly sung but curiously lacking in sensuality. One listens and admires; but the shiver doesn’t go down the spine, whatever Masetto (the excellent Gary Griffiths) may feel.David Kempster also sometimes misses the allure that is presumably what gets Giovanni  the girls. But he makes up for it by the sheer athleticism of both his singing and his movement around the stage. “Là ci darem” is a disappointment, but “Fin ch’an dal vino” is the most brilliant I can recall. He’s finely supported by David Soar as an alert, in his own way dangerous Leporello, though I sometimes miss the dark tones that used to characterise this singer’s bass register: like many basses (and nearly all contraltos), he’s maybe rising to the sexier roles. Both these singers handle Mozart’s fast-moving recitative superbly: and here, dryness is a distinct help.With the “straight” lovers, the vocal situation is no less intriguing. Camilla Roberts has the makings of an outstanding Donna Anna (pictured right with Robin Tritschler's Ottavio); she sings with poise and moves well enough for a part that is essentially statuesque. “Or sai chi l’onore” was a highlight: lovely clear, warm delivery, with only very minor technical hitches. And Caird brings out the best in her on stage, as he does with all these singers, having them move and respond, to each other, to the music and the action. Even Don Ottavio becomes an interesting figure, an elegant, correct, bespectacled ineffectual, forever drawing his sword and resheathing it. And Robin Tritschler is certainly a fascinating singer. I haven’t forgotten his wonderful “Un aura amorosa” in Così, and here “Dalla sua pace” might have rung the same bell if he hadn’t sung flat for the first minute or so. The da capo at last showed what he could do. Koenigs conducts Don Giovanni as if he had the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment in the pit, with light bowings, clear, translucent wind-playing, radiant brass at the infernal climax. In fact it’s the WNO orchestra, playing like angels. Perhaps after all we’ll get to paradise, if only by way of the dinner table.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/don-giovanni-welsh-national-opera,
669,"The Elixir of Love, English National Opera",The Elixir of Love,English National Opera,2011-09-15,alexandra Coghlan,"“An elixir with a kick, sir, one that really packs a punch”, sings Adina in Jonathan Miller’s Midwestern The Elixir of Love, and she couldn’t be more right. A night spent among the floral prints, perky ponytails and pastel wipe-down surfaces of this production is like being battered around the head with a bouquet of roses wielded by Doris Day. Frame the encounter in a Hopper-inspired set from which all traces of menace have been expunged – no nighthawks dare lurk in bustling Adina’s Diner – and you have the perfect operatic antidote (more effective than any of Dulcamara’s potions) to the onset of the winter blues.There have been renewed mutterings and grumblings of late about revisiting ENO’s strict opera in English policy, but no one seeing this Elixir could deny the electricity generated when vernacular translation, production and music come together so completely. Much of this success is down to Kelley Rourke’s slick libretto that plays fast and (foot) loose with Felice Romani’s original. Forget Italy, this is small-town, dustbowl America, where the accents are as brashly acrylic as the waitresses’ nails and the smiles are broader – and no less cloudless – than the horizon.Nemorino (Ben Johnson) becomes a grubby mechanic, pining for the love of his diner-owning boss Adina (a returning Sarah Tynan), while Belcore (Benedict Nelson) is a swaggering GI But it’s Dr Dulcamara (Andrew Shore) who really steals the show as the convertible-driving, Panama-hat-wearing conman who so charmingly exploits the townsfolk. His “Udite, udite” offers a particularly tongue-twisting showcase of Rourke’s skill and surely manages to rhyme “hysteria” and “posterior” at one point, and that’s before we get to his karaoke Barcarolle with Adina.The production pulses with the detail and character of Miller at his best, with some lovely moments of chorus interplay (a series of loo-flushing solos in Gianetta’s “Saria possibile”, women failing rather spectacularly to share in Adina’s happy ending). The gorgeous simplicity of Isabella Bywater’s revolving set anchors everything, proving itself unexpectedly flexible across the two acts.Returning for this revival, Sarah Tynan is a bewitching, coquettish Adina (pictured right), narrating her ballad of Isolde from a gossip magazine and making a microphone from a mop handle. Wiggling and romping her way through the part with the most successful American accent of the evening, her light voice sits well within the jazzed-up, music-theatre clarity of the production, flirting with the trickier coloratura passages with the same effortless skill as with Nemorino. Faultless and utterly engaging, if she wasn’t vocally quite matched by either of her leading men it almost didn’t matter.Proving himself capable of filling the Coliseum stage with his personality, Ben Johnson (making his major-role debut at ENO) delighted the audience with his deftly characterised Nemorino, all quirky gestures and beaten-down optimism.His voice still feels on the light side for so large a space, however, and while things were solid enough in the middle of the register there were a distinct lack of big money notes (certainly none added), losing some of the youthfulness and heroics that we might more conventionally expect. Nelson’s Belcore (pictured above) felt stronger, more lived-in vocally, and the balance of his charming Sergeant and Johnson’s grumpily sincere Nemorino worked well.There were just a couple of flies in the diner’s coffee however; the chorus (particularly the ladies) were underpowered and rather scrappy, and some of Donizetti’s melodies did suffer under the weight of Rourke’s virtuosic, patter-based text. While the Prelude saw some seriously sexy canoodling from flutes and woodwind, the brass lacked glitz, and balance between Rory Macdonald’s pit and the stage never quite settled.But these are practical details that will sort themselves out over the remaining performances of the run, and the many revivals doubtless still to come. Miller has definitely done it again with this Elixir which seems destined to join the likes of his Mikado, Mafia Rigoletto and even his latest Bohème in regular and beloved ENO circulation.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/elixir-love-english-national-opera-0,
670,"Il Trittico, Royal Opera House",Il Trittico,Royal Opera House,2011-09-13,David Nice,"You don't need to buy into the loose hell-purgatory-paradise trajectory of Puccini's one-act operas to greet the triptych as his comprehensive masterpiece, full of wry interconnections, orchestral wizardry and grateful if tough vocal writing. Fourteen years on from his gorgeous recording, Royal Opera principal conductor Antonio Pappano is still digging for treasurable detail in each opera; and that master-director of the unexpected Richard Jones was bound to find hidden links between his already classic production of towering operatic comedy Gianni Schicchi and the two thornier propositions now joining it. But could they muster the eight crucial voices necessary for total success?Well, at the end of the evening's emotional roller-coaster ride, I'm more or less happy with six and a half. What a shame that the looser links happened to be in two anchoring roles. It was very bad luck indeed that the house, having woken up rather late to the potential of German-Greek soprano Anja Harteros as the most poised Italianate soprano of our time, lost her due to advertised illness some way (I'm assuming) into rehearsals. Sister Angelica, the reluctant pharmacist-nun whose banked fires are linked to the society-shaming secret of her illegitimate child, needs a performer prepared to go to the very edge while keeping line and tonal beauty under control. Replacement Ermonela Jaho had some of the intensity, but the fast vibrato will have to be reined in if she's to make her mark in Puccini's most heartbreaking lament, ""Senza mamma"" - Angelica's lyrical outpouring to the news that her child has died.This is the point where, let's face it, if you're not holding back the sobs, something's wrong - and Puccini, a master at setting up truth and beauty before pulling out all the sentimental stops, knows how to make that happen. Cheryl Barker certainly assisted him in the English National Opera Trittico; so, unexpectedly, did Barbara Frittoli in the performance of a lifetime at the Met. But Jaho just didn't involve me, at least from a distance (hard to see the facial expressions which might have won back some sympathy). And her finger-wagging school of acting seemed to run in the family, shared by Anna Larsson's dramatically uncertain if vocally opulent Aunt who comes as the uneasy purveyor of inexorable family values (the top needs fine-tuning). There were, even so, plenty of dewy-eyed moments in this Suor Angelica, thanks especially to the Debussy/Massenet-like refinement of Pappano's conducting in the early scenes, a lovely cameo from Jette Parker Young Artist Anna Devin as rapturous Sister Genovieffa and later the outpouring of the great orchestal intermezzo.Besides, the curtain rises on one of Jones's several unanticipated masterstrokes: these nuns are running a children's hospital. Cue - spoiler notice - the unbearable when this Angelica decides to take her life on the ward, panic and distress as she grabs the little boy who's already wandered over to her pharmaceutical table (Jaho pictured above), and no angelic apotheosis on stage but a real shocker as our heroine gives up the ghost and a sheet is thrown abruptly over her.Bedsheets: the most pertinent connection of the evening. In the grim slice of Parisian barge life we've just seen in Il tabarro, the cloak of the title becomes the blanket under which bargee Michele and his young wife Giorgetta used to snuggle up before their infant died (all ages pass by on the banks of the Seine except the very young in this world without children). Can they make love on it above board since Giorgetta finds it so stifling down below? Fat chance now she's inflamed with passion for stevedore Luigi. Later we'll see the same baritone, Lucio Gallo, crouched by a bed with a corpse in it as prankster Gianni Schicchi; so that's why Jones has his Michele hide alongside the cloak in which the lover he's murdered lies still.Gallo lacks the right degree of grizzled, withdrawn desperation for the embittered bargee. Undeniably, though, he's one of the best Italian lyric baritones in the business, which allows for the tenderness Michele tries, and fails, to express to his wife. Later we'll see him as a rather odd but not unengaging Schicchi, more camp-it-up Village Person than cunning beefcake peasant. He has good foils in both the darkest and the brightest of the operas. Westbroek seems to be overdoing the twitchy, trailer (in this instance boat) trash girl she gave us in Jones's production of Anna Nicole - maybe the parallel is intended, a poor girl with big urban dreams - but she projects the meaning of the superb Italian libretto vividly, and is well matched when she soars with promising tenor Antonenko's physically chunky Luigi.You wonder how this semi-naturalistic set (pictured above) is going to relate to Puccini's other worlds, especially as Jones and Pappano have taken on the risk of three equally inspired set designers. Ultz's black river and barge with the symbolic black hole for a hatch meet a quay with a sewing factory - cue the ""ballad of Mimi"", nicely sung by Ji-Min Park; Miriam Buether's children's ward is antiseptic but flooded with May light, closing down to a corridor for the crucial, bleak confrontation between Angelica and her aunt; and John Macfarlane's floral-wallpapered Florentine apartment of a dying man peopled with brightly costumed vulture-relatives was originally designed to link to the pinks in Jones's production of Ravel's L'heure Espagnole.Nicky Gillibrand's transforming costumes and now DM Wood's lighting are common to all three dramas, but uncommonly striking; shadows reflect isolation in the first two operas, and predatoriness in the third, where business with the light switch brilliantly reflects the many twists and turns of how to conceal the death of Buoso Donati, and how to get at his assets in the high-value form of a house, a mule and some mills.It's easy to overdo the antics in this true ensemble comedy - witness the Met's over-the-top staging - but Jones keeps the laughs precise but uproarious, from the ramming of young Gherardino's toy car into the wall via the banging in the cellar as the relatives frantically search for Buoso's will through to Schicchi's garlanding with fag and cap of the rescued bust of Dante (the original source of Puccini's tirelessly witty librettist Forzano). I haven't ever laughed more in an opera, but then I'm infatuated with Puccini as a comic genius and happy to see the finer details so well observed.To match what's happening on stage, Pappano realises Puccini's immaculate sense of timing (equalled only by Mozart), stretches dramatic pauses to their tense limits and reaches new heights of illustrative vividness. We've had mewing cats, bleating lambs and angry wasps in Il tabarro and Suor Angelica; in Gianni Schicchi we get bitter comedy tears from the lower strings, and even a graphic bassoon as Buoso's doctor asks if he's had a bowel movement (help me, someone: is that what ""ha avuto il benefissio"" actually means?). No one knows the scores better, in short, or can make the Royal Opera strings swoon so judiciously.With a perfect line-up of comically self-interested relatives capped again by Elena Zilio's grasping Zita, and ideal young lovers (pictured above) in a Rinuccio (Sardinian tenor Francesco Demuro) of nifty high spirits talking up his prospective father-in-law and a pitch-perfect Lauretta (the lovely Ekaterina Siurina) whose famous aria slips in at just the right easy pace and level of pathos, it's impossible not to come out feeling jolly. Next time, though, we have to have Harteros as Angelica and maybe Bryn Terfel, a very different Schicchi on previous showings from Gallo's more Italianate specimen, as Michele: can't that be fixed before the production is filmed?",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/il-trittico-royal-opera-house,
671,"BBC Proms: Der Freischütz, Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique, Gardiner",BBC Proms: Der Freischütz,Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique,2011-09-10,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"What kind of work could possibly elbow aside the time-honoured ritual of performing Beethoven's Ninth on the penultimate (ie, the last serious) night of the Proms? The kind that even Beethoven was gobsmacked by. That's the sort of reputation that stalks Carl Maria von Weber's Der Freischütz, the prototype German Romantic opera, to whose crepuscular, horn-encrusted, tremolo-saturated, harmonic daredevilling and dramatic Gothicism the whole 19th century (and even Mahler and Strauss) paid homage. An epic reputation undermined slightly by a suspiciously thin performance history.Classical music's great archaeologist, Sir John Eliot Gardiner, with his bracingly unvarnished period band, the Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique, were bringing a semi-staged version of the piece that had opened at the Opéra Comique earlier this year. Despite the difficulties of converting the colourful but bald, railing-heavy Proms set into a viable theatrical space, some theatrics were retained, understandably. The story is not inconsequential. Alongside various Romantic preter and supernatural obsessions (satanic possession and magical intercession) and dramatic devices that Wagner would later steal is a gripping symbolic duel.Max, a fallible, questioning, earthbound mortal, is set against the possessed, proto-Romantic antihero Gaspard. Max must call upon Gaspard's diabolical tricks (or are they his own? The Gothic double is never far from this duality) to win his girl, Agathe. What dates the work above all is the fact that the Byronic drinker, dancer and dabbler in the dark arts, Gaspard, and his new unfettered morality (which will be soon known as Romanticism) is still so little approved of that he must be wedded and ultimately sunk by satanic associations.So it is reasonable to want to unpack some of this in dramatic terms on stage. But such is the kinetic suggestiveness of the music already, one was left wondering whether there was any need to delineate this epic struggle beyond the score? After all, no story has ever been less likely to succeed half-dressed. The plot's melodramatic focus requires careful theatrical realisation, not the sort of piddling spurts of dry ice puffing out into the Royal Albert Hall like from a behind-the-bike-shed smoker that instead we were subject to.No matter. Nothing could distract our ears or eyes from the attention-seeking antics of the score, which was being performed in a Berlioz rearrangement of the Weber original. Cleverly interpolating a colourfully scored recitative and a French libretto, Berlioz's low-key arrangement does nothing to hide Weber's orchestration masterclass: whiplashing piccolo, inky black bassoon-writing, fiery string tremolos, horn calls not of the promising, rallying kind but of the sort that seemed to summon up the dead of night.All this cold-hearted barracking perfectly suited Gardiner. He relished every windchill, his orchestra becoming the paragon of inhospitableness. The only moment that this approach let down was Weber's shift to lightness and female company at the start of the second act, in which the musical language reverts to the sort of Rossinian idiom that the composer had been composing in (without a single inspired break) for much of his life.The cast of singers was notable not just for its quality but for the suitability of each voice to each part. Andrew Kennedy's warm-toned tenor as Max was the perfect rug in which to shield yourself from all the windswept frostiness swirling round. Gidon Saks as Gaspard had the most terrifically complex colouring to his high-lying bass voice that in itself had the ability to evoke a Heathcliff-like richness of character, a meanness that was simultaneously irresistible.Virgine Pochon's Annette (pictured above left with Agathe) was the perfect fluttery foil to Sophie Karthäuser's troubled Agathe (whose hand Max finally wins). Luc Bertin-Hugault's last-minute intercession as the wise old Hermit made the case for this role (that directors were once prone to cut) better than ever. Only Christian Pelissier's Samiel (the Devil incarnate) was lost in a cackling mess of over-acting.The meaty carcass that this opera presented to the composers of its time (a distillation of the now forgotten interests of the French Revolutionary school that led back from Mehul to Rameau) saw it devoured and absorbed into the mainstream within years. Wagner stole its dramatic bones, Berlioz the harmonies and the colour, both extrapolating and exaggerating Weber's fundamentals. It was another bold piece of programming from Roger Wright. And the uproarious reception from the remarkably full Albert Hall saw it vindicated. Wright's season-long high-wire act of balancing the ridiculously recherché with the outrageously populist seems (amazingly) to have succeeded in satisfying virtually everybody.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/bbc-proms-der-freisch%C3%BCtz-orchestre-r%C3%A9volutionnaire-et-romantique-gardiner,
672,"Die Frau ohne Schatten, Mariinsky Opera, Gergiev, Edinburgh Festival Theatre",Die Frau ohne Schatten,Mariinsky Opera,2011-09-02,David Nice,"Under Western eyes, Gergiev’s Mariinsky forces had been turning to stone – like the titular shadowless woman's solipsistic husband in Richard Strauss and Hugo von Hofmannsthal’s polyphonic fairy tale – each time they stepped outside the Russian repertoire. There was the calamitous Verdi season at Covent Garden, and the ungainly Wagner Ring cycle which saw the opera company’s temporary twilight in London. In densest Strauss, the German word and the vital sense of movement arrived stillborn, but last night there were enough sparks in singing, playing and scenic vision to ignite swathes of this impossible epic.Only an ensemble capable like Saint Petersburg's great ensemble of opulent work on all those three levels should even think of attempting what Strauss, who rather lost interest in his largest-scale opera during the difficult years of the First World War, called a ""massive and artificial"" project. We should be grateful for small mercies at the Mariinsky: Gergiev seems to have relinquished his half-baked directorial concepts in conjunction with the grandiose designer George Tsypin and called in a half-decent British director, the hit-and-miss Jonathan Kent, though his revival replacement, Lloyd Wood, can’t do much with all bar one of his singers. Struggling to be heard above the vast orchestra which portrays all the elements, as well as a heaven of sorts, versus a human hell are five principal roles as tough as anything in Wagner; you shouldn’t expect to hear them all equally well sung, but vocally the first of the Mariinsky’s two casts was actually up to the mark, though dramatically of very varying abilities.All the characterisations demand huge stamina in a plot that’s less complicated than its mythic accoutrements might make it seem. There’s an airy-fairy heroic-tenor Emperor and his gazelle-into-porcelain-bride Empress, who through the mediations of a Machiavellian Nurse needs to acquire a shadow – in other words, fertility, though it would be charitable to think of it as the broader sort if Hofmannsthal’s odd scenario is not to be seen as a plea for the moral majority. To save hubby from petrification in three days’ time, she visits the hovel of a humble, placid dyer on earth, Barak, to snatch it from his discontented wife. But the Empress learns the compassionate lesson that you cannot buy your happiness at the price of a human being’s suffering.The best narrative trick in Paul Brown’s imaginative but ultimately too widely strung design, and a real surprise, if you haven’t peeked at the production photos, is the first transition from Up There to Down Here – from a gauzy heaven of purples and reds, flowers, gateways and scudding clouds peopled by an Emperor based on Mughal hunting portraits and a ballgowned Empress to the garage home where Barak washes and dries his dyed fabrics in industrial-sized machines. For that first crucial interlude Gergiev whips up a phenomenal and dazzlingly textured orchestral storm, reminding us that Strauss by then knew Schoenberg’s Erwartung and would in turn inspire the Chinese gongs and percussion of Puccini’s Turandot, as Sven Ortel and Nina Dunn’s video and projection giddy us with their cloud colours (later, the essential falcon that first hunted down the Empress-gazelle multiplies and casts ever darker shadows as the nightmare reaches its apogee). Soon the music settles into a reverie of Schubertian simplicity for Barak’s goodness, rather over-urged by a grunting Gergiev but very beautiful on its own terms.Something has probably been lost along the way of Tim Mitchell’s original lighting design. In reviving it for a different space, Sergei Lukin shows us that the Empress only has to stand by the machines to acquire her shadow; later, it’s staring her right in the face as it flickers over the rock-entombed Emperor while she hesitates over the crucial ""yes"" or ""no"" needed to get it. Fortunately it doesn’t matter too much because Mlada Khdoley is the most compelling actress on the stage, as pliant of body and beautiful of face as she is vocally near-ideal for the long Straussian lines of the composer’s most luminous heroine; you can hear the Four Last Songs already in this voice. Strauss sets up the greatest of the opera’s set pieces with a steady violin solo as the Empress faces the Solomonic judgment of her spirit-father Keikobad. Khudoley compels with her calm determination, and then scours our souls with the long passage of melodrama-shouting – extensively cut in every other production I’ve seen, not here – before the decision is ripped out of her like, as Hofmannsthal put it, the cry of a woman giving birth.Khodoleyi, not Olga Sergeyeva as the trailer-trash wife with the beautiful soul, is the first lady of the evening, though you wouldn’t know it from the latter’s curtain call. Most Dyer’s Wives are a tad squally, and Sergeyeva’s is no exception, though good on her for doing a kind of Anna Nicole strip as she renounces her shadow before clinging to her purple teddy and deciding she wants it, and Barak, back. In a relationship which Hofmannsthal knew was a little like that between Strauss and his restless ex-singer wife Pauline – to be duly reflected in the marriage-opera Intermezzo which so amusingly echoes Die Frau – the placid husband needs more bass-baritonal evenness, and more suggestion of banked fires eventually erupting, than Edem Umerov can give him.Viktor Lutsiuk’s Emperor is, like most heroic tenors, already half turned to stone at the start, and barely gets down the first scene’s staircase in one piece, but the fast-ageing voice is just about up to the mark; Gergiev and his Mariinsky cellos do most of the work in his big soliloquy. Most secure of all the voices is Olga Savova as the Nurse, capping the knee-trembling second act panoply of soprano/mezzo declamation, though alas she can neither move nor act, vital requirements in Hofmannsthal’s serpentine characterisation.Movement is no strong point, in any case, of either Kent’s direction nor Denni Sayers’s hard to interpret choreography, a poor substitute for the stage directions of the Empress’s nightmare, so much more interesting to read in the libretto than to see on this stage. The bit parts are variable, the offstage voices too far away – blame the venue – and the kids in Act II jiggle around indeterminately as if in some amateur production. Kent needs to let his principals stand and deliver more downstage, and the dyer’s battered car that has to be pulled off and pushed on needs to go; a bicycle would do, though I see its point when it appears from an aerial perspective in Act III.As the unborn babies finally twitter away and the couples celebrate their new-found fecundity in a protracted happy-end quartet Strauss just couldn’t believe in by 1918, Brown’s great ideas – the topsy-turvy view of earthly things pressing in from on high – go under in some banal scenic effects, and Gergiev, who does earth so much better than air, can’t paintbrush over the final cracks.Yet once you leave the unsatisfying finale behind in your memory, the many amazing things about Strauss’s most comprehensive score, Hofmannsthal’s offbeat mythology and the way this mighty company goes about them crowd back in to haunt. Three cheers, then, that Scotland, which launched the best Rosenkavalier of recent years (David McVicar’s, now ensconced at English National Opera) as well as the most unexpected Strauss oddity beautifully done, Intermezzo, should now play exclusive festival host to flawed but enterprising genius in a work that won’t be coming around again too often. OVERLEAF: MORE RICHARD STRAUSS ON THEARTSDESK",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/die-frau-ohne-schatten-mariinsky-opera-gergiev-edinburgh-festival-theatre,

683,"Cendrillon, Royal Opera",Cendrillon,Royal Opera,2011-07-06,David Nice,"After a heap of ashen revivals, it was time for the Royal Opera to take us to the ball in style. Which it does, for the most part. Of course, Massenet's ""fairytale after Perrault"" isn't Aida, Butterfly, Fidelio, Macbeth orTosca, all of which have deserved better from the house. Though spun out at less than heavenly length and, sometimes, so much per yard, it does have the composer's special brands of discreet charm and gentle humour, especially well served by two world-class voices out of the four leads. And director Laurent Pelly knows how to scintillate in all but one of this small diamond's many facets.I confess a special love for Massenet's pretty melodising and chameleonic orchestration which dates back to well before my none too glorious cameo role in what I think we can call the Covent Garden premiere (City Literary Institute, 1986; though this is the first time the French Cinderella has been seen at the Royal Opera and Ballet, joining better-known quantities by Rossini and Prokofiev). I can sit almost equably through the far too over-extended aftermath of the ball - always a problem; remember Ashton simply cut Prokofiev's Act III divertissement - knowing that the best is yet to come for our two lovers, a duet which extends the Tristanesque overtones of Massenet's most Wagnerian opera, Esclarmonde.That, in fact, was the only false note struck by Pelly's production and the otherwise ingenious set designs of Barbara de Limburg, both first seen at Santa Fe in 2006. Smoking chimneys are no substitute for a heath by the sea covered in flowering broom, with a great oak at the centre by which a distraught Cinderella and Prince Chaming are destined not, at first, to meet. The natural element is important, especially since Massenet had just moved to an old mansion not far from Fontainebleau, and worked his renewed love of nature into the later stages of the score. It seems a shame for the production to exclude it, even in the sweet balcony scene where our heroine welcomes in the scents of April.Otherwise, though, lovers of traditional fairytale moonshine and quaint comedy will not feel violated by Pelly's and Limburg's engagement of a giant book with the text of Perrault's 1697 tale which opens out for the walls of the Chateau Pandolfe, nor by Pelly's own fantastical costume designs which bring so much fun to the ballet sequences. These are nearly all intact, thankfully - though were they saving on castanets by snipping a few bars from one of Massenet's most delightful lollipops, the Marche des Princesses? - and wittily sustained by Pelly's regular choreographer Laura Scozzi. The Fairy Godmother looks like some lilac Third Empire courtesan, and sounds a bit raddled too as sung by Eglise Gutiérrez (pictured above right with Joyce DiDonato's sleeping Cinders/Lucette), who has the coloratura top notes but not the crystalline quality needed for the rest of the part. Her elves and sprites are multiple Cinderellas with lamps; the magic comes from the darting fireflies in the dark sky above the page-walls.So much was expected of DiDonato, and she brings her trademark affability and pathos to a Cinders who looks the part but doesn't always sound it. There's an impossible benchmark here - DiDonato's idol Frederica von Stade (who recorded the role with - horror of horrors - a tenor rather than a travesti prince, Nicolai Gedda). They share a fast vibrato, but with von Stade it was always part of a unique instrument, and I'm not sure that vocally speaking I'd be able to pick DiDonato out in a crowd. Shorn of the virtuosic Italian runs and flashes in which she's most often seen and heard, she makes a paler than intended impression to start with, and the pianissimo singing sometimes feels under-supported.It's as well that she's such a good foil for Alice Coote's supercharged Prince (pictured left), truly a voice in a thousand. There's authentically dark, languishing colour in her/his plaints, but also the fullest top I've ever heard from a genuine mezzo. So, another great performance to set beside Christine Rice's on-the-edge Marguerite in the ENO Damnation of Faust - and has any other female singer so looked the part? The same was true of Coote's Hansel, and I can't wait to encounter her Octavian and Composer - for this is surely Strauss's as well as Massenet's ideal.The oldsters are similarly a mixed bag. You perhaps wouldn't guess from Jean-Philippe Lafont's gruff portrayal that the role of Cinderella's father Pandolfe was written for a master bass-baritone. Lafont barks his way through the opening scene, and settles - but not quite enough - for the sympathetic commiseration with his unhappy daughter in Act III. It's reading far too much into the part, as Massenet scholar Clair Rowden does in the programme, to suggest that Cinderella/Lucette needs to detach herself from Oedipal attachment to a clingy dad, but there's more here for the singer to get his teeth into than Lafont finds - and those later home-and-hearth scenes really do need all the help they can get.Praise be, though, to the cult Polish contralto Ewa Podleś for stepping out of her serious diva status into the comic role of stepmother Madame de la Haltière, so written that any note in chest voice can just about stop the show. And she does, well foiled by two of the house's Jette Parker Young Artists, Madeleine Pierard and Kai Rüütel, as her strutting-chicken daughters (all three pictured right). Their pastiche 18th-century bustle is energetically paced by conductor Bertrand de Billy, who knows that the score can quickly pall if not given an extra helping hand, and despite a few slightly contrived tempi, he brings out many of its most poetic colours in dance and dream. I'm sure that the close-ups of the live screening on 13 July will keep a larger audience happy, too, especially given DiDonato's simpatica demeanour. No reason why this shouldn't be enjoyed by everyone from five to 100: take the kids along to the big screen, but perhaps let them sit out the first 20 minutes of the second half and come back in time for the lovers' next, and most impassioned, duet, one of Massenet's truly great creations.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/cendrillon-royal-opera,
684,"La Rondine, Opera Holland Park",La Rondine,Opera Holland Park,2011-07-06,alexandra Coghlan,"With opera houses in Britain now ringing to the four-letter cries of Anna Nicole and Two Boys (not to mention the rather more elderly, but no less explicit utterances of Le grand macabre) verbal taboos it seems are a thing of the past. Yet one word remains tainted, perpetually and immutably filthy, never to be voiced in polite cultural company: operetta. Whether or not Puccini’s La rondine actually falls into this genre is debatable, but like the heroine at its heart we shouldn’t allow this silken embrace of a work to be tarnished by a label, however obscene.If you were seized unawares by the opening orchestral flourish of La rondine, operetta might be among the politer designations to come to hand. For the first 20 or so bars the score resembles nothing so much as a Hollywood soundtrack of the 1940s. Camp little flute sallies are countered by the brass, all dissolved in a Technicolor wash of strings. It’s heady stuff, yet sets the scene for a surprisingly demure romance, despite Gheorghiu and Alagna’s best attempts to sex it up.Magda, the swallow of the title, is a woman kept by her wealthy lover Rambaldo in a relationship of convenience. Encountering the respectable young Ruggero, she is overwhelmed by emotion and leaves Rambaldo. When Ruggero proposes marriage, however, she realises that she loves him too much to deceive him or taint him with her reputation, so forsakes him to return to her loveless situation.Slighter than a consumptive ingénue, it is conversely the plot’s very simplicity that gives La rondine its poetic weight. If it makes occasionally for rather static drama, it also yields one of Puccini’s most devastating scores, tune layered upon tune like the soft folds of the Belle Époque dresses that waft so gracefully about in Tom Hawkes’s new production for Opera Holland Park.Playing it straight, Hawkes and designer Peter Rice trust the opera to do its work, understanding that the original setting, with its tantalising hints of the Art Deco freedoms (both aesthetic and moral) so shortly to come, is what gives this fragile tragedy its pathos. So we find ourselves comfortably settled in the salons, bars and seaside promenades of fin de siècle France, with the colours of the first two acts draining out to evocative creams and whites in the final farewell scene.Issues with the OHP pit (long and thin) have been a repeated refrain of mine, and here with woodwind placed centrally things finally gelled, with Peter Selwyn’s orchestra producing the most blended sound I’ve heard in this space. A strong cast of singers allowed the players the freedom to really release, and the result was as mature and balanced as a tent acoustic can ever hope to produce.Magda sits somewhere between the tragic Butterfly and the flighty Mimi as a character, joining the operatic line-up of fallen women in the vicinity of Violetta and Manon, but in Kate Ladner’s (pictured above with Sean Ruane) portrayal archetype falls away and she is freed up to be specific, illogical and human. Blessed with lyric tenor Sean Ruane as her Ruggero (who matches his lover dramatically if not quite vocally), Ladner is able to keep things impressively interiorised without ever losing the charge. Her “Chi il bel sogno di Doretta” does everything it should, and if she occasionally forgets to cosset the ends of her phrases, the control and vocal colour of her letter aria (“Figliuolo, tu mi dici”) more than redeems her.Although Ruane is a little tight at the top, the rest of the supporting cast (led by a pertly precise Lisette from Hye Youn Lee and Hal Cazalet’s characterful Prunier) excel, buoyed by some strong work from the chorus (particularly the men) who populate Act II (and a “Bevo al tuo fresco sorriso” that sits just the right side of a big Lloyd-Webber number) with a generous complement of Toulouse-Lautrec caricatures.I’ve sat placidly through umpteen productions of Tosca and Madama Butterfly, and never yet found a Bohème that could move me to anything other than frustration at the posturings of this astonishingly unpleasant group of characters, but whether it’s Selwyn’s account of Puccini’s score or Hawkes’s elegant production, Opera Holland Park’s La rondine could romance the most cynical of souls. When faced with such overpowering musical seduction, does anyone really care whether it’s opera or operetta? Proverb has it that one swallow doesn’t make a summer, but La rondine may just have made mine.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-rondine-opera-holland-park,
685,"Rinaldo, Glyndebourne Festival Opera",Rinaldo,Glyndebourne Festival Opera,2011-07-03,alexandra Coghlan,"Each Handel opera (or the good ones at any rate) has its own musical colour and character. The woody husk of viola d’amore and low oboes bring pastoral calm to the frenzies of Orlando, bassoons lurk with doubt under the glossy strings of Ariodante. Rinaldo, the opera which announced Handel’s arrival on the London stage, glitters with the bright tints of brass and high woodwind, with even soft-toned recorders reworked as the metallic brilliancy of an obbligato piccolo.It’s triumphal stuff, musically as unsubtle as its psychology, but this is the very joy of it. The human complexities of Alcina and Orlando are still far in the distance (even the emotive “Lascia ch’io pianga” is a manipulative escape attempt on the part of Almirena), and this pageant of lovely tunes and stock characters fills a summer evening with artful delight.In Carsen’s daydream vision, Christian knight Rinaldo finds himself a schoolboy geek, carefully pasting a photo of his beloved Almirena (all specs and plaits) under the lid of his desk. Fantasising his way out of teasing and torment, he and his schoolmates are transformed into warriors, facing off against the evil Saracens (teachers) led by sorceress Armida and her consort Argante. Familiar school spaces, gym, dormitory, playground, become their theatre of war, and Armida’s Furies are revealed as what else but St Trinian’s-inspired schoolgirls.The slightly laborious transpositions of the opening relax as we proceed, and by the time bicycles are rearing and pawing like horses and a final battle is reworked as a football match (globe as ball), Carsen has his audience exactly where he wants them, squealing with delight over each new visual gag and practically expiring at the giddy comedy of a cross-dressing episode.All didn’t go entirely to plan on opening night however; a power cut extinguished Rinaldo’s beautiful lament “Cara sposa” midway, breaking the tension Sonia Prina had worked so hard to draw out of the scenario, and the spectacular exit we’d been promised after “Venti turbini” failed to materialise. Yet all this was nothing to the problems plaguing pit and stage ensemble.After an overture that pulsed and swaggered with quality, Ottavio Dantone and The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment seemed to lose their way. Juddering with the lack of synchronicity, orchestra and soloists elbowed their way through the doorway of each cadence, scrambling inelegantly to arrive together. With so many arias demanding exposed unison between soloist and accompanying melody instrument any deviation is fatal, and so it proved here.Whether it was Dantone’s swift speeds and bizarrely irrational tempo relationships, a lack of listening from the singers (Prina was particularly guilty, rushing her coloratura and dragging after every breath), or challenging direction that caused the issue is unclear, but the result was a seasick first half that needed a good few days in the rehearsal room to settle.There’s no denying Prina’s technical solidity, the articulated precision of her coloratura and her projected lower register will keep her in roles as long as they last, but I still struggle to take pleasure in her voice. Its rough-and-tumble colours, though peculiarly suited here to an adolescent boy, too often seem pushed. Varduhi Abrahamyan’s Goffredo may have been slighter, but her rounded tone made for a much more attractive, if less dynamic, listening experience.A late substitute for Sandrine Piau, Anett Fritsch was a solid Almirena, though outshone for vocal promise by Brenda Rae’s Armida (pictured above with Pisaroni). Rae shows all the signs of a really outstanding voice in the making, and while there are still some uneven moments, her sorceress was a worthy match for Luca Pisaroni’s Argante.Singing everyone else into the shadows in Act I, Pisaroni’s easy stage presence (not aided by some contrived direction) and sooty tones recalled his previous Glyndebourne star turn as Leporello. Mention must also be made of Tim Mead’s Eustazio (pictured above). Focused of tone and displaying the musicianship so lacking elsewhere, his curtain-call cheers were well deserved.With classic productions of Giulio Cesare and Rodelinda, Glyndebourne have established themselves as the go-to company for Handel opera. While Carsen’s Rinaldo still has its adolescent growing pains to face, it has the makings of a challenger to these mature productions. As the run progresses musical issues will settle, and I imagine the resulting clarity will reveal in Rinaldo another triumph, no less significant for being joyously silly.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/rinaldo-glyndebourne-festival-opera,

690,"Peter Grimes, Royal Opera",Peter Grimes,Royal Opera,2011-06-22,alexandra Coghlan,"It’s the oldest coup de théâtre in the postmodernist playbook – the curtain rises to reveal an audience staring back at us – but still, in the opening seconds of Willy Decker’s Peter Grimes, one of the most effective. Our theatrical doubles here are sinister creatures indeed, massed rows of sombre Victorians whose brutal Christianity is no less severe than the angles of John Macfarlane’s set. As gazes meet across the courtroom in that moment we confront ourselves, discover ourselves in the folk of the Borough, implicated absolutely in their tragedy. Returning for its first Covent Garden revival (directed by François de Carpentries), Willy Decker’s Peter Grimes has lost none of its visual aplomb. Starkly monumental, his sets might feel token were it not for the fitness of their scope to Britten’s musical vision. The claustrophobic world of Crabbe’s poem cannot remain sealed in the face of the elemental energy of Britten’s sea, a force that finds its mirror in the deconstructed spaces of Macfarlane’s designs. By angling his stage steeply down to the pit he creates a sense of the action flowing outwards, propelled perpetually onward to its grim conclusion.Some canny costuming also helps to characterise the Borough – that greatest villain of the piece. All is grey and muted, characters blurring and bleeding into one another: a community whose minds and morals, we must assume, are equally indistinguishable. Only Auntie and the Nieces stand apart, their deviancy writ scarlet in their clothing.Peter Grimes is above all a tale of community, and stands or crumbles with its chorus. Minutely rehearsed and wielding some serious power, the Royal Opera House Chorus drives the musical drama, steering a neat course through the hairpin bends of ""Old Joe has Gone Fishing"", and climaxing in those most chilling cries of “Peter Grimes”. Choreographed by Athol Farmer (Ruth Moss in revival), they coil and writhe as one, sketching out visually their intentions and alliances.In the pit Andrew Davis offers similarly incisive energy, though texturally things sound a little thin at times, failing to fill Interlude VI with quite the urgency Edward Gardner and the ENO mustered in their recent account, losing ensemble in some of the more exposed passages of chordal woodwind writing.There’s a certain anxiety these days that goes along with seeing Ben Heppner’s (pictured above) name on a cast list. Vocal issues have lingered, and while at his best there’s no doubting his quality, too often the voice sounds ailing or just plain knackered. Grimes is not a forgiving role technically, the soft-spun intensity of ""Now the Great Bear"" leaves nowhere to hide, and on opening night was dismally flat. I could even forgive issues of intonation (which worsened as we progressed), were there any of the colour and characterisation Vickers channelled so memorably into his singing, but as things get tighter and more pushed at the top we lose anything but the most functional of noises. Dramatically Heppner’s Grimes has always been touching, but even here is now in danger of being outclassed by Stuart Skelton, whose faltering man-child “born to blocks, spars and ropes” turns that screw that little bit further.Amanda Roocroft (pictured left with Heppner), recently so glorious in The Makropulos Case, was also a little disappointing as schoolmistress Ellen Orford. Crafting an unusually gutsy tenderness out of Ellen’s music, it is only in the highest register that her vibrato widens to extremes, leaving the sound more than a little snatched and without the control that colours the rest of the voice. Catherine Wyn-Rogers’s Auntie is a more solid affair, and the quartet for the Borough female outcasts (with Rebecca Bottone and Anna Devin as the Nieces) an unusual highlight. Among the starry array of bit-part men, it is Roderick Williams’s Keene and Martyn Hill’s understatedly comic Rector that push through the dramatic texture, providing the human faces in Decker’s determinedly faceless crowd.There will doubtless be those in the audience still hankering after the Moshinsky Grimes that Decker’s has displaced, dissatisfied with the broad gestures and rather inconclusive approach to the material. While clarity of character is lacking here, the space of the production – both physically and conceptually – offers the audience an associative collage of images from which to craft our conclusions, whether for good or ill.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/peter-grimes-royal-opera,

694,"The Infernal Comedy, Barbican Hall",The Infernal Comedy,Barbican Hall,2011-06-18,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"The Barbican committed a grave sin last night. It forgot that people matter more than art. That their responsibility to the families of those who Jack Unterweger (the subject of John Malkovich's music drama, The Infernal Comedy) murdered trumps any interest in the dramatic potential of Unterweger's bizarre life. However constraining to the autonomy of creativity this may be, these are the rules of common decency. A portrait of Ratko Mladić that did little to show the horror of his crimes and much to convey what a loveable rogue he was would be a disgrace. And so, Malkovich's new showcase at the Barbican Hall, an apologia for a woman-hating and serial-killing psychopath, is a disgrace, for which the Barbican should be ashamed.John Malkovich is Jack Unterweger, serial Austrian prostitute-poacher and killer, fraud, literary aspirant, who published while still in jail and became a cause célèbre, with the likes of Elfriede Jelinek demanding his release. Upon his release in 1990, he became a TV celebrity, journalist and chat-show host and murderer yet again. He hanged himself in 1994, the night he was convicted.Apart from the portion occupied by the Wiener Akademie and conductor Martin Haselböck, the stage was given over to Malkovich's Unterweger and his charm offensive, a sort of half-baked comedy routine, in which we were showered with ingratiating jokes about the Barbican and life and PCs and women. It's sickening stuff, watching him work the room, witnessing the audience fall for it - falling not for the satire that was lurking behind some of it, but for Malkovich's Unterweger himself.Swap Unterweger for Mladić. Swap the two singers that came on to represent Unterweger's singers for Bosnian women. And would the audience have accepted the two-hour dramatisation, Mladić holding court, lacing a defense of his crimes with jokes and charm and misogyny, while his victims are occasionally given unsuitable opera arias through which to express themselves? I hope not.There will be those who claim this was all satire. Parts of it clearly were. The concept of the dead murderer trying to flog his book, True Confessions, was a creaky satire of sorts (Brass Eye, this wasn't). As were surely his excuses - bad parenting, foster care (ho ho). But the rest? What was the rest lampooning? All those musical dramas that offensively glamorise the lives of psychopaths? There aren't any. The only thing this piece could possibly be satirising was itself. Yet the misogyny was all too well planned for it to be a send-up.That the women had no voice of their own but instead wheeled themselves out, doll-like, Olympia-like, to deliver bleeding-chunk theatrical arias, whose words were inevitably miles away from the sentiments any rape or abuse victim would ever have, was one the most revolting pieces of misogyny I've ever seen given artistic sanction. Just as they were in the real world, Unterweger's female victims are denied their existence yet again. This time their souls are imprisoned in the words and music of the Classical arias of Mozart, Beethoven, Gluck, Haydn and Weber, none of which are in any wayabout people who'd been abused or murdered. These arias are about wronged lovers, squabbling partners, love and loss. To have these domestic battles fortifying the voices and consciences of rape and murder victims was profoundly cretinous.And with Malkovich so poorly distinguishing himself from the character he was playing (his Austrian accent was hopeless), and the audience seeing nothing wrong in lapping up the comedy of a strangler, the atmosphere became poisonous. ""Yes, must have had a hard life, that Jack,"" you could hear them thinking. ""He seems such a hoot!""There were a few attempts to shock this amoral lot out of their chummy, guffawing complacency. Malkovich strangles one of the singers and drags her to the ground. The audience responded by chuckling, as if it was a roguishly loveable act. With this disturbing collective moral stupidity dominating the hall, one couldn't think about musical concerns. Were the Akademie good? I guess so. But shame on them and Haselböck for getting involved.The enduring question was, how was the Barbican getting away with this? Why were the audience not disgusted at Malkovich's Unterweger as they would have been if he'd come on playing a show-handing Fred West? That was ultimately the stage director/writer Michael Sturminger's fault. The victims were put in an operatic muzzle; the violence was by and large pappified, excused or ignored; and the supposed wit and brilliance of this man Malkovich-Unterweger was brought centre stage. And as we know from the examples of Polanski and Naipaul, in the West, murder, paedophilia, misogyny are all forgiven if you find yourself considered part of an artistic elite - and Unterweger, remember, had literary gifts, so, murder-schmurder.The one saving grace of all this jaw-dropping dubiousness is that one didn't have time to think much about Malkovich's acting and accent. This drama was not just weak; it was immoral. I wouldn't urge you not to go; I would urge you to go and to picket. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/infernal-comedy-barbican-hall,
695,"Così fan tutte, Longborough Festival",Così fan tutte,Longborough Festival,2011-06-17,stephen Walsh,"The extraordinary Longborough Opera Festival is with us again and for the next six weeks, in Martin and Lizzie Graham’s Palladian barn theatre near Stow-on-the-Wold. This year the world’s unlikeliest Ring cycle reaches Siegfried. But the improbability doesn’t end with Wagner; there is also Verdi (Falstaff) and Mozart – also, typically, a cyclic project, which has arrived at Così fan tutte. The whole set-up is so amazing that one longs to be enthusiastic about everything. But that can sometimes be difficult.What is it about Così fan tutte? In Cardiff, Benjamin Davis set it on Clacton pier circa 1960. At Longborough Jenny Miller starts it off, apparently, in a tacky waterfront bar, furnished out of Ikea, more or less now. Davis cluttered his stage with the impedimenta of McGill-style seaside holidays; Miller and her designer Jane Bruce wheel on a Mickey Mouse lucky dip, balloons and a stray roundabout chair. Opera directors perhaps imagine they are being wildly original in relocating and destyling period masterpieces, when the truth is that they are as cliché-ridden as any hack journalist chasing a deadline (I speak with feeling).This is old ground, and repeating oneself is tedious. But isn’t it obvious that Così fan tutte is a context-based work par excellence? Even without the music, its plot depends on conventions of love, philosophies of reason, and social and theatrical mores that simply don’t transplant with advantage. The music leans heavily on these conventions as well; it sometimes parodies them, but it also uses them to create targets which it proceeds to pepper with emotional buckshot.But in Jenny Miller’s world, such things have little meaning. Her Fiordiligi and Dorabella, coarsely dressed by Hannah-Lauren Whitham off the peg from Carnaby Street, are just another pair of available girls, and when Despina complains about being a servant one is vaguely surprised to be reminded that she is one, so like her supposed employers is she. Like Davis’s men, Miller’s Ferrando and Guglielmo start as sailors, but come back, not as fitness freaks, but as men from the electricity board in raincoats, trilbies and false moustaches (which soon fall off, though whether this is a production device or bad glue is unclear). Simply to look at, this is one of the flattest opera buffa settings I can remember.But that’s not all. Miller, a singer-turned-director, is surprisingly unwilling to let the music alone. As is now inevitable the overture is heavily, distractingly choreographed, but so, unexpectedly, is much of the rest of the opera. The stage business is pretty much non-stop, reaching its zenith with Fiordiligi being wheeled round the stage as she battles with “Come scoglio”, and Guglielmo delivering his diatribe against womanhood in the by no means statuesque presence of all three of Mozart’s females. One audience member was overheard saying that he was enjoying the hilarity but missing the continuity. I couldn’t have put it better myself.The musicians survive all this well enough, sometimes very well indeed. The Longborough orchestra is a pick-up, but they play efficiently and with plenty of vitality under the sprightly Gianluca Marcianò, and I liked Miller’s handling of her tiny but perfectly adequate chorus of half a dozen, who pop up discreetly when needed but also shift the furniture and generally make themselves useful.The soloists are patchier. Elizabeth Donovan (pictured with Martene Grimson, left) is a steady Fiordiligi, with better control in “Come scoglio” than the production deserves and a touching manner if not the warmest line in “Per pietà”, sung uncanonically under the stern scrutiny of her lover Guglielmo (who has just, one may observe, been two-timing her with her sister). Louise Callinan is excellent in “Smanie implacabili”, just not over the top and genuinely funny, but at other times a shade gusty: a bright-voiced, soprano-ish Dorabella, short on warmth low down and vocally too little differentiated from Fiordiligi (is the genuine mezzo following the contralto into oblivion, one idly wonders? – but watch this space: the Cardiff Singer of the World may have other ideas). Martene Grimson supplies a very watchable and well-sung Despina, though more au pair than maid, this important element in the character having been jettisoned by the director.The men are so-so: Nicholas Watts, an attractive light tenor but inclined to coarsen in the upper reaches; Rodney Clarke, lively on stage, and vocally athletic in “Donne mie”, but without the hoped-for sensual allure in “Il core vi dono”; Sasa Cano (pictured above right) a disappointing Don Alfonso, woolly of voice and seedy of manner.

699,"Idomeneo, Barbican Hall",Idomeneo,Barbican Hall,2011-06-12,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"Mozart's Idomeneo is subjected to a famous bit of abuse in Milos Forman's Amadeus. ""A most tiresome piece,"" a courtier critic sniffs. ""Too much spice. Too many notes."" As it happens, not a wholly inaccurate statement. The work is quite an exotic curry of an early Classical opera. And in last night's concert performance at the Barbican, conductor Thomas Hengelbrock and the Balthasar Neumann Ensemble presented the dish in as richly fruited, densely scented, dramatically packed a rendition as you could imagine. One could fully see why Enlightenment ears might tire of its pungent demands - and why we might delight in them.Having said that, the colourful musical clothes hang off a rather stiff little Neo-Classical story. Idomeneo, King of Crete, has made a pact with Neptune. If Neptune saves him from a deadly storm, Idomeneo will sacrifice the first person he sees when he returns home from Troy. This turns out to be his son, Idamante, who is already in a tragic pickle, having fallen for a Trojan prisoner, Ilia, who feigns lack of interest. What rescues a slightly awkward dramatic road are objective correlatives - storms, monsters and gods - that allow Mozart to penetrate the inner life of his characters through symbolic colour painting.Hengelbrock and his orchestra (who both memorably delivered the Royal Opera House premiere of the little-known Baroque opera Niobe, Regina di Tebe last year) wasted no time in developing the turbulent theme of the evening, with an overture that offered no steady ground whatsoever. They then mounted an impressive climb up that extraordinary opening exposition of what should be dead backstory with Ilia, the exquisite, effortlessly dramatic Camilla Tilling. The tension is passed onto Christina Daletska's Idamante, who fights with her love. Considering Idamante's suicidal thoughts, it wasn't inappropriate that Daletska should have such a fragile, pained tone of voice, but with the sharp oscillations of her vibrato juddering like a butterfly and constantly threatening to shred her vocal line it was sometimes a bit of an ordeal.Steve Davislim was a subtle and lustrous presence as Idomeneo, internalising the squalls of his Act II aria ""Fuor del mar"" almost as brilliantly as the orchestra externalised them. Mozart's stormy neon colours cracked across the Barbican Hall at the hands of the soloists of the brass and woodwind sections and the busy timpanist, Stefan Rapp. Tamar Iveri was a supremely impressive last-minute replacement for Anna Caterina Antonacci as Elettra. She knew the score inside out. She displayed a surety with the emotional contours of this tragic character (a refugee in love with Idamante) almost better than her colleagues. Her mad scene, in which she becomes a thing of pity and terror, was a triumph. Again the orchestra lead the way, the strings digging so deep you could hear the wood of their bows clattering the body of their instruments. Hengelbrock had unleashed the hounds for this scene.Yet for all the riotous tempests (often capped by strong choral outbursts from the excellent Balthasar Neumann Choir) that befell us, the thing that rattled the soul the most was the Act III quartet. It's a passage that appears to slink and slide through every nook and cranny of the body spiritual. So many notes. So much spice. Emotionally exhausting.

Its message - drink, chill out, back off and the girl will be yours - is as good a moral guide to life as any. But it was still surprising to leave Glyndebourne last night satisfied. Beforehand, I couldn't imagine a way in which last year's brashly inventive Americana production of the opera by Jonathan Miller for the ENO could be bettered. But it almost was.Not by the visuals, mind. Lez Brotherston's sets and Annabel Arden's direction followed a tried, tested and yawn-inducing 1950s route. Is there now a UN resolution mandating opera directors to update buffa to this easy, breezy, black-and-white, flat-packed decade? Because, for the third time in as many weeks, here we were again: this time in a quaint, rustic 1950s square, with water pump, fairy lights and (drum roll) a pylon - and if I tell you that that was the most exciting prop of the night, you'll understand the fun we had with the rest of it.But wandering amid the intermittent clutter, mundanity and irritations was as fine a cast as you could wish for. The central quartet etched out their relations and respective psychologies economically and swiftly. Stephen Costello (whose Royal Opera House debut impressed our Edward Seckerson last year) was a revelation as the lovestruck electrician Nemorino, thumbs hooked into his dungarees, his tousled head digging into his chest. His many attempts to get into Adina's knickers (first by actually trying to get into her knickers, then by trying not to) elicited tip-top deliveries, sweetly phrased and powerfully sung.I even succumbed to the delights of Danielle de Niese, who plays the object of Costello's at first unrequited affections. Her Adina, delivered with unfailingly attractive bunny-eyed coquettishness, seemed only to be short of things to throw when things don't quite go her way. She was controlling her coloratura better than ever, nailing every one of her showstoppers, which meant one could almost completely overlook the occasional moments when her cantabile lines were swamped by her wild fire of a vibrato.Rodion Pogossov's Sergeant Belcore - Nemorino's jackbooted love rival - was a joy. He had a familiarly Italian swagger that frequently went up in a puff of pomposity. Paolo Gavanelli's Dulcamara, the quack doctor whose quack potions sets the drama in motion, couldn't have offered a sweeter tone but might have offered a livelier go at fraudstering. As recompense, we were given a zany, silent sidekick - I peronally preferred the pylon. The choir were a fine crowd of plank-brained peasants. Conductor Enrique Mazzola and the London Philharmonic Orchestra offered a lightly authentic performance (there was a fortepiano) and kept an energetic but clean ship. Our eyes may have remained hungry, but our ears feasted well.  ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/lelisir-damore-glyndebourne-festival-opera,
701,"Simon Boccanegra, English National Opera",Simon Boccanegra,English National Opera,2011-06-09,David Nice,"Public feuding, private sorrows: the elemental passions of Verdi's Ligurian power struggle haven't had a vivid London staging since the Alden-Fielding ENO classic gave it a guiding (or, according to taste, hindering) giant hand in the late 1980s. Dmitri Tcherniakov, the most disciplined opera director to have come out of Russia, was a clever choice for the company to invite to the Coliseum. But would his Boccanegra more resemble the thought-through revelations of his Bolshoi Eugene Onegin or the fits-and-starts family carry-on of his Aix Don Giovanni?In the end, it occupies a grey zone somewhere in between - literally, in Tcherniakov's own designs, once the setting of the ""25 years earlier"" Prologue, rooted in the 1960s rather than Verdi's 14th century, has been consigned to a de Chirico-esque empty street scene, the only colour on clinical contemporary walls (there's one striking gambit from ENO's now-regular video designer Finn Ross between Prologue and first act). Probably we're in Genoa, the buildings suggest, and the plebs-versus-patricians struggle can work, even if you need to forget about Guelphs and Ghibellines. But there's no whiff of the Mediterranean which permeates Verdi's more poetic moments; in fact the only waves in the first scene are those made by the rather big vibratos of leather-jacketed, blue-jeaned pirate Boccanegra as sung by Bruno Caproni and of Roland Wood as besuited Paolo, the man who would crown him leader. Top-notch Verdi singing has to wait for the entry of stalwart bass Brindley Sherratt as patrician Fiesco, whose daughter has given birth to Boccanegra's missing child and now lies dead in the house over the street.Leap forward however many years - Tcherniakov stretches the time warp slightly - and more sea breezes at dawn are only dimly sensed through a frosted-glass window by the girl who'll turn out to be the long-lost daughter, trapped in the bare clinical house of the grim Grimaldis. Rena Harms - even-toned, a tad uniform in colour and veering to metal rather than the shot silk which usually graces an ideal Amelia - looks the part of the raven-haired Italian girl fucked up by absence of mum and dad (the rather overdone confusion is to be this staging's nemesis, and not in a good way for a final scene where the newlywed does a Lucia mad scene on her recently rediscovered father's exit, quite against the grain of the quiet musical curtain).The most Italianate singing of the evening comes from her lover Gabriele as unfalteringly sung by tenor Peter Auty (pictured right with Harms), clinging on for stylish life in his emotional Act II aria despite the unflattering vowel sounds of James Fenton's perhaps inevitably melodramatic English translation. He and Sherratt also share one of the two moments of the evening where musical beauty weds with a striking stage picture: the duet in which the disguised Fiesco wields a hypnotic power over Gabriele that starts like a holy benediction but ends with a gun in the puppet-youth's hands. The other occurs in the exquisite coming-together of long-lost father and daughter, where Tcherniakov does not betray the huge emotions involved, allowing the reconciliation to take place only by degrees before dissolving again.So far, so good, especially from Edward Gardner, following the introspective side of his Berlioz Damnation of Faust by shaping silvery sounds from the ENO strings in Verdi's many moments of inwardness. Somehow the great council chamber scene doesn't quite fire with forward thrust, despite focused chorus work; Caproni needs more smoothness of line to sustain the great cry of peace and reconciliation, and lacks the last degree of authority to chill the blood with his curse on wicked Paolo, who's tried to abduct his daughter in vain. You realise more than ever how convoluted and often unconvincing the plot lines are, but all credit to Tcherniakov for typing up the back stories before each scene.As the drama and the music steer more towards convention in the last two acts (Caproni and Sherratt pictured left in their characters' last meeting), the ideas run a bit thin. Somehow the violent outbursts of Wood and Auty, with one chair kicked over too many, veer more towards Basil Fawlty than convincing Italianate rage, and you spend too much time wondering why Boccanegra hasn't drunk from the poisoned chalice and how he's going to die. The answer is, he doesn't; but the sea kind of comes in to the final equation as he draws two waves (or gulls?) on the whiteboard and dons a paper-boat hat to go into exile. It could have been more affecting than it sounds, but it isn't; the final curtain is weak, as if Tcherniakov thought he had to go for a final production gambit after reining in for the string of duets, trios and quartets into which the later stages of the opera ultimately fall. It's all well-intentioned work, but the update doesn't tell us much and, once beyond the early recognition scene, it fails to move as it should.Watch part of the casino scene from Tcherniakov's Berlin production of Prokofiev's The Gambler on YouTube",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/simon-boccanegra-english-national-opera,

703,"Tosca, Royal Opera",Tosca,Royal Opera,2011-06-07,ismene Brown,"Tosca-at-Covent-Garden is a commodity, like bacon-for-breakfast - a pricier commodity, to be true, at officially up to £229.50 a seat, but in both cases people want to get what they expect. For the final performances next month in this summer revival, with the megastars Angela Gheorghiu, Jonas Kaufmann and Bryn Terfel, all seats are sold, with touts on eBay offering a pair of amphitheatre seats at bids over £300. Clearly Tosca ain’t art so much as the Royal Opera House's ATM, and therefore I have to suspend my disappointment as an opera lover in the opening of the run last night, with a different cast, since this show is all about banging those bucks and not springing any surprises whatsoever.I, like those excitable people who wrote the fascinatingly vivid programme notes about the backstory and original Tosca play, should just take Prozac and calm down. Last night’s production isn’t about ominous, bloody events on the day that Rome’s fate is handed over to Napoleon as revolution blazes over French borders. It isn’t about a jobbing opera singer who mistakenly thinks that she has royal protection against murder and rape, and who trusts in Catholicism even while the Pope is being overthrown. It isn’t about a successful religious painter of woolly liberal sympathies who fails to see that being aristocratic is no defence in anarchical times. It’s about a soprano, a tenor and a baritone, and a couple of nice big Rococo sets and rivers of violins washing seductively under the tunes. It's about Opera with a capital O.Paul Brown’s set and costumes also come with the capital O. There is a cramped split-level Act I, showing the back view of the high altar and the crypt below it, all gilded bars and railings, nice idea, but not enough space to deliver it; a stunning Act II panelled study for Scarpia, with a monumental Cellini-style David and Goliath bronze statue 20ft high, and a torture chamber behind the only book shelves with any books on; but Act III is a disappointingly unvertiginous flatness under a starry sky. There’s a plethora of candles, setting Mark Thompson the challenge of providing candlelit glows as well as celestial rays, which he expertly surmounts. Cavaradossi has an ice-cream seller’s pink-and-white striped waistcoat, Scarpia a vastly over-ornate coat, and Tosca’s gala dress is all boobs, frogs and puff sleeves - on a generous figure I’d think other styling would be possible.The present cast in this new run of Jonathan Kent’s 2006 production is a warm-up act for the big one in July with Gheorghiu, Kaufmann and Terfel - which will be filmed for cinema release in winter - and it has a few unexciting virtues. Martina Serafin sings Tosca extremely well with a warm, soft-grained Italianate voice and a cuddly femininity that strikes with wholesome innocence and niceness. I find her voice lacks the tragic predilection, the edgy frailty that makes so much more dramatic sense of Tosca’s jealousy, volcanic unreliability and gullibility. Serafin offers a sweet smoothness throughout the voice that last night delivered mixed messages - not least, a very beautiful but disconcertingly gentle “Vissi d’arte” that hardly fits the high-wire horror of the moment she faces.Actress she doesn’t try to be, at least not for such an intemperate female persona as Tosca. Still less of an actor is her Cavaradossi, Marcello Giordani (pictured left), a rotund old-fashioned Italian tenor with welcome old-fashioned Italian tenor virtues, but with nothing in his imagining of the character to make one see anything about Cavaradossi’s life as a court painter with dangerous friends. Giordani simply concentrates on singing firmly, loudly and with good tone, and not moving about too much.Astonishingly for this day and age, the production director Duncan Macfarland allows the two stars to stay physically cool and uninvolved, not to say awkward with each other. Serafin sings erotically (and blasphemously) in the chapel of a night of lovemaking she and he might enjoy, and Giordani walked behind her and clutched her feebly through the balustrade of the steps she was sitting on. I snorted with disbelief. In the last few moments God gives them on earth in Act III, they expressed love 12ft apart, turning away from each other as if simply to vary the static look. This truly is antediluvian opera direction, and I can’t imagine Gheorghiu and co will obey the floorplan so docilely.The Scarpia is a more interesting case - Finnish baritone Juha Uusitalo makes his Covent Garden debut in challenging circumstances, warming the costume up for Terfel, for whom one supposes the long Napoleonic wig and a hugely ornate coat are designed. Uusitalo’s voice is much lighter in timbre and weight, he is built smaller, and yet he had the sketch of something rather more interesting last night than the other two principals. For one thing his Scarpia felt like a real character - he looked smelly, his hair had a greasy look, the coat was ill-fitting, he swaggered in it clumsily like an ugly man trying to big himself up by dandifying himself. He made you suddenly notice his confession of inadequacy as he menaced Serafin's Tosca: “I have waited a long time for the love of a diva” - none of Gobbi’s immaculate, villainous sexiness here, but a validly repellent reading. (Pictured right, Uusitalo with Hubert Francis as Spoletta)Between Uusitalo’s dramatic subtlety but lightweight voice, and the other two’s big, decent voices but tepid acting, one’s attention was easily drawn to the pit where Antonio Pappano was whipping up a Technicolor melodrama that very nearly made up for the onstage lacunae. Pappano is a richly emphatic colourist in this music, an urgent orator of swoons, starts, tortures and raptures (bouquets to the haunting clarinettist for ""E lucevan le stelle""). And yet, when it comes down to why last night’s show was underwhelming, it’s got to come down to him to sort it out.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/tosca-royal-opera,

705,"Rigoletto, Grange Park Opera",Rigoletto,Grange Park Opera,2011-06-03,alexandra Coghlan,"They say that old sins cast long shadows, but these are nothing compared to the shadows cast by old productions. To set Verdi’s Rigoletto in 1950s America inevitably courts comparison with that operatic patriarch, Jonathan Miller’s New York Mafia reworking. That the setting here in Daniel Slater’s revived Grange Park production should be explicitly LA, his Mafiosi transformed into corrupt LAPD cops, should make more difference than it actually does. The result, however, looks and feels remarkably similar, struggling – unfairly – to claim its own turf and escape comparison.Grange Park has a reputation for being the loveliest of the country house operas, and there’s something about this grand old ruin, surveying a glorious Hampshire river valley, that gives the shivers that the more polished, domesticated delights of Glyndebourne and Garsington (I've not yet seen the new-look Garsington Wormsley) just can’t match. A crumbling bastion of the past, there’s something about the feudal grandeur of the place that feels right for Rigoletto, Verdi’s Renaissance tragedy of brutal mores and social caste.Celebrating the appointment of LA’s new Chief of Police, we open in a flurry of peaked caps and shiny badges, the Duke alone distinguished by his civilian suit. Tightly waisted women drape themselves decoratively about the scene, barely distinguishable from the prostitutes of Act II; this is a world of men, and more particularly of white Christian men, as the entrance of Monterone (Andrew Greenan) makes clear.Casting both of the opera’s outcasts, court jester Rigoletto (Damiano Salerno) and wronged father Monterone, as Jews (Orthodox hair curls and a skull cap proclaim Monterone’s Orthodoxy, while a menorah dominates Rigoletto’s mantelpiece) underlines their separateness, but if there was a subtler point to be made about the particular milieu of 1950s LA then I missed it. Coming on top of Rigoletto’s deformity (here a livid birthmark covering his face) which already sets him visually apart, the issue of religion seemed to cloud the politics of a tale whose impact comes from its simplicity.Challenged by a disproportionately wide stage, the difficulty of any Grange Park production is creating a balanced ensemble sound. Although conducted with efficiency and no little sympathy by Toby Purser, the English Chamber Orchestra never quite feel in command of this huge score. Compensating for orchestral numbers with brute force (the flutes in particular were lobbing their music like grenades at the too-close audience), theirs is a potentially effective chamber performance that attempts rather misguidedly to recreate a full symphonic effect. Sitting halfway back I would have begged both players and singers to have a little care for their audience; volume and weight of tone are only impressive if deployed appropriately, and the Grange Park auditorium is not the Metropolitan Opera.That being said, there is much to enjoy in the quality of singing on offer. Marco Panuccio’s Duke (pictured above with Damiano Salerno as Rigoletto) has all the money notes (though he along with the rest of the cast might be discouraged from getting these out at every possible occasion in increasingly ornate cadenzas) and is at his best in full spate in ""E il sol dell’anima"" and ""Questa o quella"". Returning to the role of Gilda, Laura Mitchell offers a reliably pitched, if rather hard, vocal performance. There’s something of pressure in her sound that prevents her lovely spinto soprano from flourishing fully, giving it a rather unfinished quality at times.Damiano Salerno’s Rigoletto is something of a cipher. While his vocal performance develops and settles noticeably into the Act II vengeance duet, his character proves a little unyielding. The move from public self to private – from vicious courtier to exiled father – which can be so moving, here lacked clarity. Fretful and angry from the start, he denies himself the opportunity to expose these qualities to us more gradually, denying us a share in his emotional process. Strong vocal support (and some solid acting) from Carolyn Dobbin’s Maddalena and Sparafucile (Timothy Dawkins) made for a delicious climax in designer Angela Davies’s Modernist boudoir.Daniel Slater’s Rigoletto is not the production to rival Miller’s or to break new ground in this classic tragedy. This is a serviceable, sensible use of resources (inevitably limited in the impressively self-starting and precarious world of country house opera), and one that offers its audience the good night out that they all don bow ties and come out to Hampshire to find. For my money, however, if it were half the volume, it could be twice as good.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/rigoletto-grange-park-opera,
706,"The Magic Flute, Garsington Opera",The Magic Flute,Garsington Opera,2011-06-03,stephen Walsh,"Tamino and Pamina, in Mozart’s great masonic opera, go through fire and water, as well as trials spiritual and emotional, before achieving their sunlit triumph at the end of it all. They would have sympathy with Anthony Whitworth-Jones and his Garsington Opera team in what must have been quite as frightening a battle to locate, plan, design and build their new pavilion on the Getty estate at Wormsley, near Stokenchurch on the M40, within barely more than a year.I ended my review of their final production (Britten’s Midsummer Night’s Dream) at the manor last June by reporting that the company needed three million to keep afloat. It became three and a half million, but they got it. And the result is a triumph no less great than Mozart’s lovers’: a superb new theatre in a parkland setting as magical as any you could imagine this side of – where? Glyndebourne? Grange Park? Iford? Garsington Manor itself?There’s no serious comparison. Those places have their beauties, but none of them offer anything remotely like the great sweep of parkland, lake and woods that makes up for the admittedly rather dull house and gardens at Wormsley. The new demountable theatre surveys this landscape like some modern equivalent of a Beckford folly: it both challenges and defines it, both clashes and harmonises with it. As you leave in the fading light of a June evening, picking your way along the wood-chip roads or through the long meadow grass, the brightly lit pavilion gleams out across the park like a stage-set in its own right, with a wing of softly backlit marquees stretching out along the perimeter. Pure enchantment! (But pray it doesn’t rain…)Of course, the outside of such a theatre is all very well for picnics, but it’s the inside that matters for opera buffs, of whom there were plenty, in among the great and the good, the makers and shovers, this opening night. It seems to me that Robin Snell, the architect (who also worked on the new Glyndebourne opera house back in the Nineties) has got this right as well. Unlike the old lean-to theatre at the manor, which you always felt might get whisked away by a modest gale, at Wormsley he’s designed a proper four-sided theatre, very much open to the evening sun (so a fair challenge for directors of operas like The Magic Flute, or for that matter A Midsummer Night’s Dream, where darkness is required), but solid and comfortable and permanent-feeling – deceptively so, since it will in fact be put up and taken down each season.The stage is big and open – no proscenium, no wings, no hiding place at all other than what the director might put on it. Mozart’s three doors (unlabelled) occasionally trundle forward off a plain, timber-clad back wall, which is presumably part of the building rather than the set, though one can’t be sure. Characters come and go through trap doors. Tamino’s flute and Papageno’s noose drop down from the visible flies gantry; the three boys float across worryingly high up in an upturned parasol engaged in an understandably desultory pillow fight (parasols and umbrellas are iconic for director Olivia Fuchs in this work, as they were for Dominic Cooke at WNO, though quite why is a puzzle, unless they’re to keep off the Sarastran sun).Papageno appears on a bicycle and rides out of the theatre, right round the outside front-of-house, and back in on the other side of the stage, all during the orchestral introduction to his birdcatcher’s song: the death of mystery, perhaps, but one of the wittiest, most brilliant stage entrances I can remember, and one which set up the evening as a kind of domestic pantomime, making the best of mildly straitened circumstances: a spectacular best, it must be added, climaxing in the unnervingly real fire of the first ordeal and the comically bathetic rain shower of the second that will – on wet evenings (which this one, by divine intervention, was not) – unite cast and audience in shared misery and shared hope.Fuchs’s staging, performed in English (Jeremy Sams) and with much-trimmed dialogue, has its pointless-seeming digressions: why does Tamino enter pursued not by a serpent but by a bevy of black-clad binge-drinking tarts, and, more wasted than scared, light a fag (another of Fuchs’s icons – Papageno even offers the front stalls a puff)? Why is the Speaker (Benjamin Bevan) a bookish philosopher in a tweed jacket but the “beauty and wisdom” of the final chorus a teenage rave? Why are the animals Tamino charms with his flute replaced by Tamino lookalikes, similarly (and, by the way, very unprincelily) clad in jeans and flowered white shirts (very deep, this, but I can’t see down it)? Why, finally, are these philosophers of wisdom, nature and reason so rough, always pushing people over (a habit that proves catching)?“Why? Why? Why?” to quote the three ladies when they find Tamino in Sarastro’s temple. Perhaps, like Tamino, we shouldn’t ask, but instead relish the speed and invention of this constantly entertaining production, a more than worthy opener for a marvellous new opera house, and, with hardly an exception, immaculately sung and played.Not much question that the show is stolen by William Berger’s kilted, mohicaned Papageno, no silly feathered yokel with a birdcage, but a savvy urban hedonist bested by subtler, if not wiser, types (after all, he gets the girl: Ruth Jenkins, excellent; Sarastro is stuck with “lofty purpose”). Berger is also a deft, musicianly baritone, and a communicator who has the audience, if not the birds, eating out of his hand. Opposite him Robert Murray (pictured right with Berger) is a mildly flabby Tamino, but a fine, elegant Mozart tenor; and Sophie Bevan is the most natural Pamina imaginable, both in voice and stage presence.Kim Sheehan is an utterly brilliant Queen of Night, costumed like a panto demon but angelic in her upper register (we can forgive her a couple of missed top Fs: she gets most of them, so perhaps the misses were to remind us how hard it all is). Iain Paton is a funny and stoical leather-jacketed Monostatos – tactfully white (though oddly Fuchs doesn’t stint on the other non-PC aspect of Schikaneder’s libretto, its condescension towards women, which just happens to be embalmed, like the anti-Semitism of A Merchant of Venice, in one of the most sublime of all masterpieces). Evan Boyer’s Sarastro is suitably solemn, dignified, unexpectedly youthful, not always completely projecting his lowest register and tending to favour oratorian pronunciation: “comparsion”, “harpiness”, etc.A strong team of ladies, two fine armed men, and three rather tall but small-voiced boys, towering over the diminutive Sophie Bevan: too many individuals to name. And a vigorous, athletic, youthful chorus, also required sometimes to act as scenery, with or without umbrellas.It should be said that, among his other successes, Robin Snell has produced what, from row C of the stalls, sounds like a near-perfect acoustic. Its great virtue, curiously rare in opera houses, is that it favours the voices, but without – if this isn’t too much of a paradox – disadvantaging the orchestra. Martin André’s Mozart is brisk, alert, inclined on occasion to push the voices, but never to overpower them, and nicely balanced instrumentally. The opera was preceded by a fanfare, specially commissioned from Jonathan Dove, which oddly enough did not sound well in this space. This may have implications for bigger orchestras here. Or it may just be that Dove misjudged – or simply didn’t know enough about – the theatre he was writing for.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/magic-flute-garsington-opera,
707,"Turandot, Welsh National Opera, Cardiff",Turandot,Welsh National Opera,2011-05-29,stephen Walsh,"No point in going to WNO’s Turandot expecting to see images of old Beijing, for all the charming lady in a Chinese floral hat on the programme cover. The curtain goes up on the inside of an enormous galvanised dustbin festooned with photos of what might be lads from the football team but are actually Turandot’s victims to date. Calaf is a vagrant, Turandot a blue-suited Rosa Klebb, Ping, Pang and Pong fascisti bureaucrats in coloured suits, the “Popolo di Pekino” (both sexes) shirted and tied office workers, and so forth. Perfumes of the East? Forget it. This is Beijing Mussolini-style.Like it or not, it’s a powerful revival, restaged by Caroline Chaney with back-up from the original director, Christopher Alden, and capturing brilliantly – more so, in my memory, than when the production was new 17 years ago – the amazing emotional energy of Puccini’s score, an energy that unfortunately evaporates at the point in the final act where he died and his pupil, Franco Alfano, bravely but vainly stitched together a kind of ending.How do they manage it? Well, for once one can say that everything hangs on the musical performance, but also that the production team have understood how to work with the company’s strengths in this department. Chief among them is the chorus, in majestic voice from curtain-up and constantly providing a spectacular sound correlative to the barbarities on the stage. A few ensemble problems on the first night in the great “Gira la cote” chorus, with its curious echoes of the Volga boatmen. But mostly this was highly integrated ensemble work, perfectly matched to the stylised eurythmics of the opening scene, the ebbing and flowing spectator sport of the riddles, and the pyjama-ed menace of the final act, where the people, sleepless and desperate, turn on Liù to extract from her the name of the unknown prince.Alden’s political point here, that Puccini’s last opera is a coded attack on the fascist regime, is perverse and unhistorical. But it works dramaturgically up to a point, and it often works with the music. The three masks, neatly played by David Stout, Philip Lloyd Holtam and Huw Llywelyn, are at once sinister and funny, and their sentimental attachment to their long-lost country homes as they pile up the death warrants is something very Eurotalitarian, like Hitler’s love of dogs.The image of a state where everyone, including the Emperor and his bloodthirsty daughter, is inescapably locked into a rigid structure dominated by fear also helps the music at moments. Rebecca Evans’s wonderfully statuesque Liù, deeply touching in the stillness of “Signore, ascolta”, dignified without being mawkish in “Tu che di gel sei cinta”, carries with her a moral purity one doesn’t necessarily associate with Puccini. No less convincing in this context is the riddle scene itself, arranged like a courtroom with its public gallery, its bench of scribes, its clear spatial demarcations within which Turandot’s movements towards Calaf, so seemingly out of character, make a strong impact. From the start it’s a relationship touched by ambiguity, at least on her side. Half-loving him on sight, she practically gives away the third riddle by staring him in the face as she repeats the question to which her name is the answer.Whether Anna Shafajinskaia’s singing is helped by this soft apparatchik image of Turandot is a moot point. One might doubt that such an office tyrant would turn (not to say detach) so many princely heads. But a more serious question is whether it’s fair to expect even a top fascist to sing “In questa reggia” without at least some kind of fancy-dress cover. Somehow the exposure of those initial high D’s, sung cold, seemed to be aggravated by the severity of the costume, and Shafajinskaia took a while to get into her stride, only opening out in the more richly orchestrated G-flat section.The Calaf, Gwyn Hughes Jones, also has his quarrels with the production, which unkindly places him upstage for several of his big vocal moments. He’s a stylish and fearless singer of this music, though the tone can thin under pressure. And in the end the character is nearly as impossible as Turandot’s, however stunning the music. As they step over the corpses of Liù and Timur (Carlo Malinverno, suitably quavery) into each other’s arms, one can only feel that they deserve each other, and it simply remains to decide who’ll do the washing up.It won’t be Lothar Koenigs if I allocate the tasks. His place, after getting such splendiferous playing from the WNO orchestra and such a powerful performance all round, is decidedly with the angels.

Verdi's first confident shot at music-theatre, revised for Paris in 1864 but already vivid in outline four years before Rigoletto broke the mould, deserves better.

710,"Don Giovanni, Glyndebourne Festival Opera",Don Giovanni,Glyndebourne Festival Opera,2011-05-23,stephen Walsh,"Two 1950s Mozarts in one weekend might seem like pressing the contemporaneity of great art unnecessarily far. But Jonathan Kent’s Glyndebourne Don Giovanni, revived on Sunday, is a much less crude update than the WNO Così. True, the dramatis personae might have wandered in from a Fellini film set vintage 1960, with Giovanni recast as Marcello Mastroianni, but the setting itself, by Paul Brown, is at least quasi-classical, columned and arcaded, with a whiff of Hellfire Caves and, in the end, a sort of Chirico-esque fragmentation, none of which conflicts too drastically with the social and sexual meltdown depicted in this astonishing score.I missed the production when it was new last year, but by all accounts the staging (Lloyd Wood) is now tighter and the casting less variable. Some of the goings-on, especially in the later scenes, remain messy; some decisions look perverse. Why is there already a grave in the “dark courtyard” where Leporello (alias Giovanni) brings Elvira in the second act (and why, incidentally, does whoever decides such things prefer the dull Vienna version of this scene to the Prague original)? Why, above all, is there no statue (the “pierre” of Molière’s “festin”; Tirso de Molina’s and Pushkin’s “stone guest”), but instead a decaying corpse that rises from the grave. This really is to abandon the crucial symbolism of the cold classical monument suddenly coming to life and crushing those who imagine you can imprison the human spirit in a stone edifice.As usual, though, with modernised settings of classical opera buffa (or dramma giocoso, as Mozart actually labelled the piece: Emanuele Senici’s programme-book article on this topic, though a trifle learned for a windy afternoon on the lawn, is well worth reading), the crucial question of class – so basic in 1787, so distressing to us now – goes down the plughole, taking with it the attendant issues of class betrayal, manners versus behaviour, and noblesse oblige. For a film star, Giovanni’s activities would hardly raise an eyebrow, or even a super-injunction. For Mozart’s Europe they stood for a social and political earthquake: “Long live liberty”, as Giovanni and his aristocratic guests are made to sing, like kidnap victims in an internet video.Whatever its dramatic credentials, this is a strongly cast revival which should moreover improve with the uncorking. Lucas Meachem is a suave, relaxed anti-hero, given to outbursts of extreme violence; the beating he hands out to the Commendatore strays well outside any imaginable code of honour. But his singing belies his manners: consistently elegant, refined in timbre, and struggling only, like most baritones, in the breathless pace of his champagne aria. Matthew Rose is an excellent Leporello, too tall, I suppose, for a servant who’s lived on husks but OK for Fellini’s Rome. Toby Spence sings “Dalla sua pace” very nicely and otherwise stands around amiably – all Ottavio can do when deprived of “Il mio tesoro”, which Mozart scrapped for Vienna. David Soar does the wronged, sulky Masetto to a tee.But the most memorable performances are in the female half. Miah Persson (pictured above) is a wonderfully listenable-to Elvira, with lovely, easy tone in her great entrance aria and her stern, Handelian advice to Zerlina, “Ah, fuggi il traditor!” She needs to tidy up her miniature cadenza in the Act I quartet, but that’s a detail. Albina Shagimuratova’s Donna Anna is low on stage presence but high on vocal allure, slightly lacking in the darker colourings for my taste, but immaculate and musicianly throughout. Marita Solberg’s Zerlina, robbed of her peasant status in favour of a little tarty-party girl, sings like an angel of coaxing untrustworthiness. No wonder Masetto can’t stay angry with her for five minutes under the caress of her “Batti, batti” and especially “Vedrai, carino”, a treatment for cuckolded husbands that ought to be marketed in bottles.This is, of course, an early-music Don Giovanni, with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment presiding under Robin Ticciati: very relaxed but mostly quite pacey, as perhaps befits the transparent sounds of these instruments, though it doesn’t suit the singers in every case. Nor, oddly enough, does it always match the production, which has its pauses and longueurs, at least some of them obviously intentional.

712,"Così fan tutte, Welsh National Opera, Cardiff",Così fan tutte,Welsh National Opera,2011-05-21,stephen Walsh,"“I’ve seen an asp, a hydra, a basilisk”, Fiordiligi sings as she tries to ward off Ferrando in the second act of Mozart’s cynical dissection of true love. Benjamin Davis’s new production for WNO converts these beasts into a crocodile, a dragon, assorted dogs and a teddy bear: and not as figments of Fiordiligi’s overheated imagination, but as the all too real promenade furniture of whichever British seaside resort Davis and his designer, Max Jones, have chosen as their 1950s version of 1780s Naples.With this kind of relocation, you can usually tease out some kind of connotation which lends “relevance” to the stuffy old nonsense that comes in the form of opera libretti. But this particular concept, which betrays the text at almost every point, seems to defy serious consideration, except as one of those smart after-dinner ideas (“Wouldn’t it be fun to set Bohème on an airbus?”) that ought by rights to be scraped off the plates after the guests have left. From the moment when Davis drowns out the overture with audience cackles at the antics of what the programme indulgently calls “a community of pier entertainers”, you know you’re for it.Thereafter, one bright idea follows another in a relentless stream of pink, yellow and mauve vulgarity, McGill-style, complete with fat-lady-in-swimming-costume, and culminating in Despina singing “Una donna a quindici anni” in an upstairs bathroom waving a lavatory brush and Guglielmo screwing Dorabella in a postcard kiosk. True love may have been a sham in Mozart’s Vienna; but in Benjamin Davis’s Barry Island it’s barely even a distant memory.It’s hard to pass by such visual horrors, not least when they clash so blatantly with the music’s unfailing style and refinement. It might, I suppose, be argued that Mozart himself set up an equivalent conflict by cloaking the repulsive goings-on of da Ponte’s libretto in some of the most exquisite music ever written. But the cynicism depends specifically on a certain uniformity of surface idiom: it was precisely these people, in their elegant dresses and with their enlightened protestations of fidelity and moral correctness, who so quickly gave way to the first real emotion that ever entered their lives, and who then (and this is the crucial point) so readily discarded it again the minute it was exposed as based on a fraud. In the world of McGill, the fraud is no more than a double entendre, to which any kind of refinement is simply alien.Having got this off my chest, I’ll say that, if you shut your eyes, there is plenty to like about the performance. Even visually there are things, if you can ignore the imagery; Davis is an experienced staff director with the company, and he knows how to manoeuvre his cast (a bigger one, in this sense, than da Ponte allowed for) around the stage. This is a well-choreographed production. And musically it is strong. Camilla Roberts is a genuinely touching Fiordiligi, finely controlled in her two big arias and perhaps suffering the least from promenade life, though she might have been spared “Fra gli amplessi” over a wash basin; Helen Lepalaan, from Estonia, does suffer a bit, and tends to overact with it, but sings stylishly – a fashionably soprano-ish Dorabella (in fact, Roberts at times displays the stronger chest register of the two). Claire Ormshaw is a clever, musicianly Despina, if a shade small of voice, especially when made to sing out from interior rooms of Max Jones’s Gelateria Botticelli.The men have their ups and downs. Robin Tritschler delivers “Un aura amorosa” as exquisitely as any tenor I’ve heard since Luigi Alva, forces a little at other times, but is all the same a fine, watchable Ferrando, even with a false nose. The Guglielmo, Gary Griffiths gets a moustache as well, together with yachting shorts (would any girl fall for such a twerp?), and his singing also coarsens now and then. His half of “Il core vi dono”, perhaps the greatest of all seduction duets, was disappointing, though it did the trick for Ms Lepalaan. But his self-righteous little rondo about the frailty of women was enchanting -doubly so, of course, for its sheer brazen hypocrisy. Neil Davies’s Don Alfonso, in this production “a pier entertainer”, survives his check suit and pork-pie hat as well as could be expected, and also survives Mozart’s mean refusal to give him a decent aria, dispatching his witty fragments of this and that in fine style – though where his philosophical view of life and love comes from is by no means apparent.In the pit Daniele Rustioni controls all this very capably and with an easy, undemonstrative style. The playing, especially by the wind sections, is superb. Rustioni’s isn’t the most emotionally pointed Così I’ve heard, but it preserves faith in the essential idiom of this long-suffering masterpiece.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/cos%C3%AC-fan-tutte-welsh-national-opera-cardiff,
713,"The Bartered Bride, BBCSO, Bělohlávek, Barbican Hall",The Bartered Bride,BBCSO,2011-05-21,David Nice,"What a relief, for half of last night's semi-staged concert performance, to have left behind Britten's claustrophobic wood at English National Opera and to seek refuge in Smetana's Bohemian village inn of good cheer. Czech music's national comic treasure isn't an opera I feel the need to see in the opera house again; its dramaturgy is thinly spread, its vocal rewards second best to instrumental pleasures. So it was a joy to see a carefully reduced BBC Symphony Orchestra at the heart of things, hypersensitive to doyen JiříBělohlávek's canny interchange of village band and Wagnerian sounds. There were plenty of characterisations to smile at in the impressive line-up of Czech and Slovak soloists, too.Unfortunately the soprano and tenor taking the roles of the young village people whose true love we never doubt will triumph over hard cash and misalliance weren't really among the loveable ones. Vocally, they were secure if singular. Dana Burešová (pictured below) played a shrewd, responsive Mařenka, well able to look after herself until the bartering seems to turn sour, and Kenneth Richardson's lively direction gave her plenty to react to. But it's so hard to forget the loveliest interpreter of the role, peaches-and-cream soprano Gabriela Beňačková, when Burešová's tone is more the kind that would curdle milk, albeit with the occasional bouquet of roses in bloom on selected top notes. I wouldn't mind seeing her as Verdi's Lady Macbeth, but the sound isn't right when, in the later of many revisions, Smetana finally gives his heroine an aria of supreme pathos, a moment of Mozartian depth with Tristan overtones.Oddly we weren't involved in this, nor in the curiously uncharismatic stance of the tenor singing Mařenka's true love Jeník. It's a role with an often insanely high tenor tessitura, so there was much to be thankful for that Tomáš Juhás could cut the mustard in that distinctively Czech/Slovak style. But charm? Forget it. That was why we all rooted, I think, for Aleš Voráček's Vašek, the stammering mummy's boy to whom Mařenka is supposed to be married off. Voráček, so poignantly matched by Bělohlávek and the orchestra in his Act III arietta of perplexity, delightfully underplayed the tomfoolery, restricting it to his large number of baffled entrances and exits - an economy from which Jozef Benci as the marriage broker basso buffo Kecal could have learnt. He warmed to the fuller, deeper resonances, but it's a painfully unfunny part, and I always long for the Act I ensembles in which he expounds his plans at soporific length to be over. The last of many cameo-role singers, the younger bass Ondrej Mráz, as the circus Indian ""from Tahiti"", gave every indication that he would have made a better job of it.No reservations at all, either, about the handsomely cast sets of parents, with the ladies especially - comic fruity Lucie Hilscherová and sympathetic, dignified Stanislava Jirků - bringing warmth to the simple depths of the great Act III Sextet. In fact, the whole of the concert's second half revealed Smetana rising to every new challenge, not least the much-needed injection of a visiting circus announced by a scene-stealing declamation from Jaroslav Březina's Ringmaster. And here was a typical case in point of Belohlávek lavishing almost more love on simple recitative than it deserved: how did he get the strings to bring so much rich colouring to a single punctuating chord?The whole orchestra, in fact, had to take on multiple roles, from the ants-in-pants hurly-burly of Overture and Dance of the Comedians - the most joyful encore material in the entire orchestral repertoire, surely - to aping local musicians in the early chorus scenes, crisply done by the excellent BBC Singers, and growing up regretfully when the characters do. Special credit to Richard Hosford, quick-changing from rustic clarinettist to songbird and sorrowful sounding board for our tender-hearted lovers, to circus trumpeter Michael Moller and to the virtuoso relish with which John Chimes rang the changes on the timpani parts in the dances. And thanks to Belohlávek for not over-sophisticating the many polkas as if they were by Vienna's Strausses rather than plain-speaking numbers for Bohemia's populace.For all the orchestral range, the eventual recording that's been taken from this performance, with patching to follow, won't displace pride of place for the Supraphon CDs - soundtrack to an equally charming film - where Beňačková and Peter Dvorský knock sympathetic spots off Belohlávek's lovers. What the evening did do was have me want to get up and join the circus, like Vašek as lured by the voluptuous curves of gypsy Esmeralda Salamanca (Kateřina Kněžíková, pert and pretty), and make me as happy as a child. By which, of course, I don't mean the likes of Britten's little master Miles, but rather the two who get a line each as village kids announcing Vašek as a bear on the loose - a panda, not sure why - Maxim Dusek and Babette Rust. They deserve a credit as much as any of the bit-part players for bringing broad grins to the audience in a more than pleasant evening.Watch Beňačková and Dvorský in the Act III duet of The Bartered BrideListen to Karel Ančerl conduct the Dance of the Comedians in 1947 ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/bartered-bride-bbcso-b%C4%9Blohl%C3%A1vek-barbican-hall,
714,"A Midsummer Night's Dream, English National Opera",A Midsummer Night's Dream,English National Opera,2011-05-20,David Nice,"Just think, said a veteran enthusiast of Britten's operas when I showed him the earliest publicity designs for Christopher Alden's production, you could set them all in a school, even Gloriana - what about headmistress Bess and head prefect Essex? But could you squidge everything into the one shape, I wondered? At ENO, it makes instant sense in the composer's near-perfect musical translation of Shakespearean wood magic that Oberon is the schoolmaster who prefers changeling pre-pubescents to now-adolescent, discarded Pucks. That's the strongest of starting points. But can the basic premise embrace lovers, spells, rude mechanicals and Athenian court?Yes it can, at least in this Alden brother's hands, and with a grim rigour that set some of us reeling from the parallel universe we'd been compelled to join, others - a critic or two among them, I later learnt, shame on the whole pack - booing loudly, presumably at the putative violation of composer's and playwright's more innocent visions. Violation there certainly is, a deliberate going against the grain of what idylls Britten seems, consciously at least, to have intended in a general drama of strangeness - chiefly Tytania's infatuation with translated Bottom (no midsummer sweetness, no ass's head here) and what's usually the poignant reconciliation of fairy and mortal worlds in the Scots-snap finale, concluded here with a bitterly sarcastic slow handclap. But for the first time I heard far more of the feral, jarring notes in the often bony score, and that has to do not only with the hard light that Alden's production, Charles Edwards's surprisingly adaptable school-block design and Adam Silverman's lighting shine on it, but also a knife-edge complementary vision from Leo Hussain conducting the ENO Orchestra.Once you've accepted that you're not going to see the wood for the school, anything goes. The stark, grey facade works well with the sighing, groaning string glissandi that come from somewhere deep in the forest of Britten's own dream-world, as an old boy (a not always explicably anguished Paul Whelan, only to be revealed as Britten's Theseus two-thirds of the way through the action) conjures up his stricken younger self, an astonishing, angry performance by Jamie Manton. Zombie schoolboys of the late 1950s or early Sixties - the time of the opera's composition - line the glassless window frames: these are our fairies, a far cry from the Kensington WH Auden so loathed about the first performance.It's not until the trumpet and drum rattle an acrobatic routine that's never going to be danced to here and the sullen teenager speaks his lines in a sour, cracked voice that you realise this is our Puck, and his master Oberon is the bespectacled schoolmaster at the blackboard (correction time for ""this is thy negligence"" pictured right, with Dominic Williams's ""changeling boy"" looking on). It was essential on the first night that the stylish Iestyn Davies, suffering from a throat infection and unable to call upon his similarly stricken understudy - another, extremely promising countertenor Iestyn - should go convincingly through the motions while William Towers, called up from Glyndebourne, did a wonderful job from a box at the side of the stage. We know the magic Davies can conjure, but it couldn't have surpassed every colour and inflection Towers brought to bear on the great Purcell-style solo of ""I know a bank"". Huge kudos to both for saving the integrity of the show.But what were we watching here - Oberon and Tytania quarrelling over a little changeling boy, or ghostly Peter Quint and the Governess struggling for the soul of little master Miles in The Turn of the Screw? The parallel is perfectly apt, because Oberon's spectral music also carries the queasy colour of the celesta: he, too, is ""all things strange and bold"", and even just as an acted performance, Davies's managed to capture something of the threatening appeal behind the schoolmasterly repression. All this, it's not too implausible to believe, ran deep with Britten; in his comprehensive interviews with folk who knew the composer for his major biography, Humphrey Carpenter called upon librettist Eric Crozier to witness that Britten told him he'd been raped by a master at school. Fantasy or truth? We'll never know, but there it is, it won't go away and it would certainly account for the more subcutaneous utterances of this tortured genius. John Bridcut, who contributes a typically sensitive note to the programme, has also made a finely nuanced documentary and written a lucid book on Britten's complex relationship to childhood, and why it matters to his music. Yet it would be reductive to make A Midsummer Night's Dream just about this, and the aura of abuse, if not the lifelong misery it causes, is in any case kept as intangible and threatening as it is in The Turn of the Screw. The sexual fantasies and confusions of adolescents are everywhere, once-straitjacketed feelings are released by puffing on the ""weed"" that serves as Alden's magic juice. There's the fumbling, pansexual heat of the mixed-up sixth form lovers - Allan Clayton ringing of tenor tone as a bumbling, bookish Lysander despite advertised ill health, the girls (Tamara Gura and Kate Valentine) less clear diction-wise than their ENO predecessors in the beautiful, bed-ridden Robert Carsen Dream.And of course there's Alden's deliberately against-the-grain handling of the Tytania-Bottom encounter. Puck-become-Theseus's part in it, trapped in a red-lit bondage inferno that's never naff or crudely sensationalised, isn't quite clear; but Anna Christy, vocally too much of a pipsqueak coloratura to convey the measured sensuousness of the Fairy Queen, acts out her spliff-liberated violence with grim relish. And Sir Willard White (pictured above left with Christy) may not care at first to relish the misappropriated words of basement-dwelling weaver/caretaker Bottom, but he's game, and still in good shape both vocally and physically, for the sexual shenanigans of the nightmare.There's a real coup here in de-twee-ifying the ""fairies"" and their role in the musical idyll. The kids have broken out, in the dream at least, with fags and shades; the piping recorder and homely percussion music that entertains Bottom becomes a terrifying orgy of rapping, stomping, window-rattling sound. It well prepares us for the eruption of greater violence later in the act. For the second time in just under a fortnight, I'm not going to spoil the shock of a visual coup, but this is where Edwards, Alden and Silverman really come together at their best. And this is a more consistently realised show than Gilliam's fitfully brilliant Damnation of Faust.The fug of the nightmare gives way to a frozen tableau as Act III supposedly unravels the confusion. Each group is unbound - Davies and Christy winding their way in slow-motion ballroom dance up the school-block stairs, the lovers making beautiful work of their ecstatic quartet - and the difficult transition to the daylight world of Theseus and Hippolyta's wedding is superbly made. The very lamentable comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe brings belly laughs, but the kind that quickly freeze. We're now in a riotous red-and-yellow world of amateur theatrics with Annigoni's 1956 Queen looking on (pictured above right). Up Pompeii! meets Carry On, but with the repressed libido of all those No Sex Please We're British innuendos released. So repulsive, inebriated, pissing and vomiting Snout as Wall (Peter Van Hulle) actually shouts another line not in the original Shakespeare; Britten and Pears added only one, ""compelling thee to marry with Demetrius"", but here the tittering audience of lovers in a box are told to ""fuck off!"" too.There's lots of mooning from Simon Butteriss's Starveling, the most consistently funny of the mechanicals in his green tights, and thigh-flashing from Michael Colvin's excellent Flute as Thisbe, but her passion ends the play rather darkly as Puck pops up again to propose our mock-Lucia finish herself off. The trauma is bound to return, and in one final touch of perverse magic, the most innocently beautiful of all Britten's operatic resolutions, ""Now until the break of day"", works brilliantly within the tension of Alden's context. Did I have uneasy dreams about it? Of course.Watch snippets of a very different staging accompanied by ""Now until the break of day"" in Baz Luhrmann's legendary Raj-set Opera Australia production",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/midsummer-nights-dream-english-national-opera,
715,"The Damnation of Faust, English National Opera",The Damnation of Faust,English National Opera,2011-05-06,David Nice,"Anything goes in the wacky world of Berlioz’s Faust story. It’s a heaven and hell of a lot better than Gounod’s, but it isn’t an opera, it isn’t an oratorio and it certainly isn’t the gospel according to Goethe. So Terry Gilliam, ENO’s latest wild-card debut director, was right not to play by all of the composer’s already rather warped rules. At first you sigh: not the Nazis and the Holocaust again. But only an oddball visionary like Gilliam is going to come anywhere near the often disorienting musical pictures painted by the most original of Romantics.And the Romantic movement in which Berlioz played such a turbulent part is already in its decadence by the time of this operatic Faust's first misadventures, at odds among the turbulent Volk who ruffle the Caspar David Friedrich landscape (if the brilliant Hildegard Bechtler's mountain backdrop, pictured below, is a pastiche - and I don't quite recognise any original - then it's as superbly imagined as any of her other diverse contributions). Gilliam has the brave idea of whizzing through imperial carve-up, dissension and First World War to the bunged-in strains of the Hungarian March - usually a dazzling orchestral showpiece, here sounding a little subdued in ENO music director Edward Gardner's hands, though there are finer and more sensitive things to come.So by the time the maths-addled Doktor - Peter Hoare, sporting a ginger coxcomb to outdo the one I saw on the Globe's resident comedian the previous evening - and his infernal sidekick, a suave and commanding Christopher Purves, arrive in a rowdy Bierkeller, the swastika-ed thugs are already in evidence, routing the commies and threatening trouble for the Jewish merchants parodied in a chillingly clever twist on Mephisto's ""Song of the Flea"". Even so, and despite top-notch choral singing in the grotesque fugue, you wonder where the whole ""Springtime for Hitler"" thing can responsibly travel after this, especially since the realism seems as if it's going to get in a bit of a knot with the fantastics of Gilliam's and Berlioz's fertile imaginations. And the multitudinous detail which would probably look terrific in the director's natural cinematic home sometimes feels a bit cluttered even on the wide Coliseum stage, placing evident strain on a crammed opening-night first half.The convincing answers are twofold. Even after that march Berlioz's militaristic strain is both persistent and incidental; by turning much of it into edgy National Socialist pageant, Gilliam gives a reason, though even as a taut gymnastics parade choreographed as tightly as it was by Leni Riefenstahl, the soldiers' mêlée which is supposed to get Faust into Marguerite's house makes a weak first curtain. But the anti-Semitic strain turns out to be an opportune, rather than an opportunistic, trump card. The encounter of Berlioz's Faust with the innocent object of his desires is a meeting between an idealistic, idealised maiden and 60-second man (the briefest of seductions is played for comedy). Plus Berlioz's Mephisto seems inexplicably interested in damning the heroine as quickly as he can. If we see her suddenly unveil a menorah to light it, only to contradict herself by putting on a blond, chaplet-crowned wig, we quickly get a different message and a chill as to what this devil's up to with this very free thumbnail sketch of Goethe's Gretchen.The message and the chill come and go throughout the street-and-bedroom scene, but there's a genuinely original bit of choreography - fine work here from Leah Hausman - to Berlioz's Minuet of the Will-o'-the-Wisps, taking us through ritual humiliation and window-smashing before turning the clock back in the whizz-bang coda. So we have a genuine inkling of a more terrible than usual fate in store for our heroine. And, oh yes, we quickly care when she's embodied by the instantly sympathetic and lustrous Christine Rice (pictured left), probably the British mezzo of a fine batch most inclined to take risks; Sarah Connolly is a cool customer by comparison. Rice's ""Ballad of the King of Thule"" already tears at the emotions, but it's the heartbreak of Berlioz's saddest aria, the one I'll forever know as ""D'amour l'ardente flamme"" and pass, if I may, on Hugh Macdonald's necessarily pat translation, which brings the greatest frisson of the evening. The idea is strong - Marguerite about to be shipped off east with other despoiled Jews, musing on happier times in misery - but it would be better if there were less insistent movement around her.Still, Rice's is fledgling greatness pushing itself thrillingly to the limits, and Hoare comes close in the ensuing breadth of Faust's soliloquy to nature. It's an insane role: too high-lying in the French pretty-boy manner for Hoare to manage in the duet, where he needs a voice double for the top notes. But, if no heroic tenor, he can certainly carry and cut through the heavier stuff. Dramatically, his role is much less clear and nuanced than his previous ENO triumph as the man-canine in Simon McBurney's production of A Dog's Heart (which apparently Gilliam came out of saying, ""He's done it all - what can I possibly add?"" He needn't have worried). Still, the look of this monologue-scene is another of Gilliam's and Bechtler's coups: no sylvan landscape now, but rougher rocks and mountains in which it's Purves's Mephisto who plays the Friedrich Wayfarer while Faust burns his books.The show has now opened up to the vision Berlioz needs. It's diffused a little by the ""Ride to the Abyss"" in a motorcycle and sidecar, but Finn Ross's giddying video designs hold faith with what is, by now, an astounding orchestral tension under Gardner. Hell's ministers, led by an aerobics-conscious Adolf aloft, crucify Faust upside down on a swastika (pictured right), which works because we've had Leonardo's Vitruvian Man to pave the way, and Purves steps suavely back into ringmaster role, in a narrative passage usually reserved for male semichorus, as video-projected snow begins to fall. I won't spoil the impact of the final image, for once, but I suspect it will stun future houses into a more awed silence than the first night's noisy media-circus crowd. Suffice it to say that I never thought Berlioz's usually saccharine apotheosis could be anything but a disappointment. This ""in paradisum"" sung by a never-better ENO chorus and children's voices as a crowd of reverent onlookers giving some hope for a better future proves me wrong. Go and judge for yourselves whether this is an ENO risk that has paid off; I'll hopefully be returning to confirm a hunch that it has.Watch Terry Gilliam speak about his production of The Damnation of Faust",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/damnation-faust-english-national-opera,4
716,"Werther, Royal Opera",Werther,Royal Opera,2011-05-06,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"We all knew about the throat problems and the vocal-cord-threatening surgery. But Rolando Villazón's post-operation return to the Royal Opera House last night appeared to reveal heart issues too. At least that was the only way I could explain the endless arm-swinging and chest-clutching. Twenty, perhaps 30, times he clutched and swung. Surely this wasn't Villazón's attempt to characterise Werther's heartache, was it?For the first two acts, it seemed so. It initially blew a hole in the work. Jules Massenet's Werther is an economical drama. The libretto (an adaptation of Goethe's Sorrow of Young Werther) relies on soliloquies. One has to work very carefully to develop a detailed interior life for this young love-struck poet in order that we might believe him and, to some extent, care for his future. Villazón, however, rather than addressing his tormented soul, spent most of his time quite self-consciously courting the audience.So for the first two acts we had to look elsewhere for our nourishment. Clearly from the cheers that followed, many found this succour in Villazón's voice. In the past, I'm sure I would have too. In one way, I was grateful that at least there was a voice; that there was still a controlled but ardent beam of sound coming from his lungs. But it must be said: it was not the warbling of old. The opalescent quality is gone. A smoother, smaller, more colourless stone remains. Still, as he settled into his stride, the musicality and even some of the fiery warmth returned.But by the time Villazón had got going, so had Sophie Koch (Charlotte), the married object of Werther's attentions. And even though it was often impressive the way Villazón handled his long-breathed lines, Koch's effortless offerings, generous and full, stole the show. Unlike Villazón, she had already filled out the workings of her character's interior life with great credibility. The dutiful young woman of Act II gave way to an enfeebled self in Act III, crumbling as she read out her old flame's letters. All of it was attended to by the inky blackness of an alto sax, setting up a scene of Bergmanesque intensity when love-famished Werther returns.Whatever the failures in direction in Benoit Jacquot's revival production, the music stayed true. Jules Massenet's washes of sound, halted by bold moments of colour were vividly conjured up by conductor Antonio Pappano and the Royal Opera House orchestra. It filled in for the subtlety that was lacking from the attendant roles; Eri Nakamura's overacted Sophie and Audun Iversen's underplayed Albert (Charlotte's blank betrothed).Charles Edwards' sets had a couple of Biedermeier delights to offer: a towering door and wall in the first act like a scene from a Hubert Robert, transforming colour as the various lights of day and night passed over it, and a breathtaking final tableau, in which the scene of Werther's suicide, a garret, emerges slowly from the back of a snow-filled stage. Not to be too little-girl about it, but the descent of the starry flakes to a haze of pizzed ostinatiwas magical.Act III of Benoit Jacquot's production of Werther: Sophie Koch (Charlotte) and Jonas Kaufmann (Werther) at the Opéra Bastille in 201",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/werther-royal-opera,
717,"From the House of the Dead, Opera North",From the House of the Dead,Opera North,2011-05-06,graham Rickson,"Janáček’s stark Prelude is a stunner: there’s no conventional beginning, no conventional thematic development; it simply starts, as if a light switch has been flicked on, and the baleful opening theme is distorted, repeated, squeezed until it leads into an extraordinary stretch of solo violin writing. Based on Dostoevsky’s novel,  Janáček’s final opera isn’t a faithful adaptation – it’s a selection of loosely linked scenes spread over three concise acts.A new inmate, Goryanchikov, arrives and is flogged as a political prisoner. In the closing minutes he’s pardoned and released, while the rest of the prisoners return to their cells. It’s remarkably static - the Opera North chorus barely move a muscle for long stretches – and the few standout arias are monologues in which prisoners recount their gloomy back stories. But it’s also one of the most moving, musically exciting of 20th-century operas and a brilliant display of mature, late Janáček – echoes of the brassy Sinfonietta and the ecstatic Glagolitic Mass are everywhere.John Fulljames recently directed a witty, coherent production of  Janáček’s The Adventures of Mr Brouček for Opera North, a picaresque comedy with plenty of scope for set pieces. Here, the challenge is much greater – how do you manage to make an opera set in a Siberian prison camp dramatically and visually thrilling? Brouček made imaginative use of video back projection, and here Fulljames playfully has some of the surtitles (not strictly necessary, as the opera is given in David Pountney’s translation) unfolding directly onto the stage set, as if we’re reading graffiti scratched on breeze-block prison walls. It’s a striking effect, also used when Skuratov’s grim back story is projected onto a rolling sheet of cotton, as if we’re reading film credits.Flourishes like this prevent the greyness prevailing, as does the care with which Fulljames makes his cast move around Dick Bird’s stage set. Watching the emptying of slop buckets near the beginning is compelling, as is the beautifully choreographed forced-labour scene, here updated so that the prisoners are wielding welding torches. Bruno Poet’s subtle, sombre lighting lets us discern just enough.The singing is consistently impressive: Alan Oke’s Skuratov and Robert Hayward’s Shishkov are both standouts, despite the contrast between the beauty of their delivery and the bleakness of the stories they recount. There’s excellent support from the Chorus of Opera North, but the evening is made unmissable by flawless orchestral playing under Richard Farnes, with each mercurial gear change achieved without effort. The textural spareness is frequently startling, and an augmented percussion section really let rip, with rattling chains, anvils and tubular bells.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/house-dead-opera-north,
718,"Pelléas et Mélisande, Barbican Hall",Pelléas et Mélisande,Barbican Hall,2011-04-19,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"""Ne me touchez pas! Ne me touchez pas!"" Mélisande's jittery first words could be the motto for the whole of Pelléas et Mélisande. How to touch, what to touch, when to and when not to touch, more specifically, how to mark without bruising, are the subjects and challenges thrown up by Debussy's delicate piece of operatic symbolism. Ones that all the artists in last night's concert performance at the Barbican Hall tackled with incredible levels of musicality.There wasn't just an extraordinary sensitivity to the delicacies of this miraculous score. There was an honouring of the essential underlying principle of Debussy's work, which is the idea that, if you want something said, don't say it. This is why the opera is so devoid of what might be thought of as classically significant events and so full of what should be throwaway asides. The music and narrative are focused on revealing the dramatic potential of omission.Natalie Dessay seems to know this well. She never indulged Mélisande's words or her presence. But neither did she leave any timbral stone unturned. Every ""Je suis heureuse"", ""Je suis triste"", ""Ou?"" and ""Oui"" was both rich in colouristic meaning and delivered effortlessly. Less was more in manner, too. Mélisande's rawness was played not through any banshee-like wildness but through the most intensely absorbing stillness one could imagine.Some saw dramatic fault in this; Dessay was too wedded to her score, they insisted. I found it mesmerising. Her immobility, her blank stare, her fixed terror, seemed a perfect reflection of the consequences of the abuse that her poor Mélisande undergoes and has no doubt undergone before we find her lost in the forests.Simon Keenlyside's Pelléas shows Mélisande a way out, a way to live and flourish, through an embrace of play and sensual touch. It was an exquisite performance. No other singer of his age could so thrillingly or convincingly reconfigure themselves to the impulsive swings of a boy. Mélisande's voice, learning new intimate tricks in Pelléas's company, suggests a reversal of fortunes is in the offing. But her husband Golaud (impeccably sung and acted by Laurent Naouri) and his bruisingly abusing hands refuses to let her go.All the smaller roles had their attractions, from Khatouna Gadelia's fresh Yniold to Marie-Nicole Lemieux's anxious Genevieve. Young Nahuel di Pierro's bass contribution as the Doctor was memorable. Alain Vernhes's Arkel, though appropriatly forlorn, was the only disappointment in his slightly lame delivery of the heartbreaking final lines. But mostly everyone dealt with their many emotional and musical delicacies with great skill.They were no doubt taking their cue from conductor Louis Langrée and the Orchestre de Paris, all of whom were restlessly skimming the surface and never allowing themselves to bed down. Their approach led to one very strange conclusion. Of the many baffling things about this eternally baffling work the most baffling is the idea that the more superficial the performance the more profound the results.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/pell%C3%A9as-et-m%C3%A9lisande-barbican-hall,

722,"Iolanthe, Wilton's Music Hall",Iolanthe,Wilton's Music Hall,2011-04-01,David Nice,"What's this? Goosebumps? Tears? Surely not in the usually brittle world of the Savoy operas. Yet handle Sullivan's pathos with tenderness, make everyone believe in a recognition scene between a sinning fairy and her preening peer of a husband, and the spectators will be putty in your hands. It helps that they've already been softened by top-notch baritones, tenors and falsettists, tickled by dance routines and amazed by the freshness of Gilbert's lyrics - all suffused by the glow of Wilton's Music Hall, which can incline us to take even a spoof fairyland a little seriously. Lloyd Webber, eat your heart out; in the exuberant world of Sasha Regan's ""all-male Iolanthe"", G&S can still yield the wittiest, most tuneful musical in town.Even though it all begins with one lone piano in the near-darkness, like Peter Brook's dead-on-arrival Mozart the other week, you know there have to be more engaging things in store when Christopher Mundy gives us much of Sullivan's best overture with an energy that already leaves that fey Flute behind in a much more torpid dreamworld. Once the story is truly kicked into action by boys with torchlights, picking up a dusty old score of Iolanthe on a debris-laden stage with a Narnian-suggestive wardrobe, there are no cuts and no compromise in the feminine register of our fairies (Matthew McLaughlin, Patrick George and Joseph Davenport pictured above) - and surely no D'Oyly Carte chorines would have been up to the mark of Mark Smith's choreography, with graceful sign language to complement all that tripping hither. I don't know how much has been changed since the show's sell-out start in Regan's tiny Union Theatre, but the present venue fits it like a silk glove.Stewart Charlesworth's fantastical designs look weird but not kinky, with lacy white underwear for the fairy ladyboys, dressing gowns and eccentric paraphernalia for the rhubarbing old lords with whom they come into conflict. Actually the ""Entry of the Peers"" seems to be whipping up cachuchas, fandangos and boleros from another G&S work, but all this busy going against the pompous grain certainly has everyone working with tireless energy; and later, Private Willis - company ""dance captain"" Raymond Tait, deadpan-funny - does a Scots jig in front of the curtain rather than a solemn strut before parliament in the immortal ""Sentry's Song"".What's to take seriously? Well, Sullivan delves deeper than Mendelssohn as we learn how Iolanthe forfeited her immortal privileges by falling in love with a mortal. Her summons from 25 years at the bottom of a lake is occasion for flashing, lighted mirrors; later, her decision to die at the hands of her Queen by revealing herself to her lost husband so son Strephon can marry the girl he wants turns the action earnest again. Christopher Finn plays this absolutely straight, his fabulous popstar falsetto harnessed to serious intent; the kiss between his Iolanthe and Shaun McCourt's crisp Lord High Chancellor (pictured right with Finn) touches surprising depths.Balancing this is the lighter play of the two young lovers (admirable how Sullivan keeps their music more or less pastoral throughout). Louis Maskell with his matinee-idol looks also has vocal and dramatic presence, sounds as yet a bit short-winded, but once he's decided what exactly he wants to be, his career is surely going to be a brilliant one. Against him, Alan Richardson has some shrill soubrette stuff to deal with as another of Gilbert's sly ingénues, but again manages to be both appealing and dignified - a lovely performance.Indeed, what's also touching is the range of voices, especially in countertenor and male soprano territories, many of their owners straight out of drama school but all impeccably well cast, from Reuben Kaye's leggy fairy flirt Celia to Matthew James Willis's goofy Lord Tolloller (pictured with Luke Fredericks's Lord Mountararat below). Another lyric showstopper - and the great Victorian duo keeps rolling them out in Act II, after a first-act finale of overwhelming resourcefulness - is the Fairy Queen's ""Oh, foolish fay"", delivered with consummate artistry by true countertenor Alex Weatherhill. I doubt if the older ladies usually mockingly cast in this role could have sung it with such warmth and line.So dazzling are all these virtues that the known enduring strengths of Iolanthe seem almost incidental. Yet its mockery of the Lords - whose supernaturally ordained infiltration by fairy-to-the-waist-only Strephon will put their institution up for ""competitive examination"" - and its anticipation of a forced liberal-conservative coalition still get the laughs in the right places. Not every line is timed to fall musically on the ear; some of the notoriously cut-glass dialogue needs working on. But that's a very small flaw in a show that's pure joy from start to finish. Pirates, Pinafore and Mikado can all fend for themselves these days, but the more ambitious scope of Iolanthe has long been in need of special pleading. Here, in the wonderful world of Sasha Regan, it finds it, but with such a lightness of touch that we can only leave Wilton's flitting into the East End night.

His funky, plushly Moog-ed, concerto-like suite struck me as rather tasty. I even said that I couldn't wait for last night's fully worked-out operatic world premiere at the Queen Elizabeth Hall. How wrong I was.I've seen plenty of bad opera in my time. I've seen things that have offended my ears. Things that have offended my eyes. Things so nauseatingly rubbishy they panzer-attacked my nasal cavities and asphyxiated my soul. But nothing has made me want to pick out my cochlea with a blunt 50-page electronica guide or bash in my retina with the edges of a signed Goldfrapp CD case more than Piccard in Space.Of course there are many types of bad opera. The sort that tries but fails. The sort that has already failed but tries. The sort that neither fails nor tries. This was much worse than those. Piccard is a flawlessly bad opera. It doesn't try to fail. It doesn't fail to fail. It doesn't even just fail. It succeeds triumphantly in its failure. Piccard is the patron saint of bad opera. Name a possible criticism and this opera will be found guilty of it. Patronising to the core, witless to its very end, musically muddled and dramatically adrift, Piccard limps through its mostly pilfered routine and its nauseating attempts at interaction like a kiddy-party clown with bad breath. Worst of all, it raided (without creative licence) both Dr Atomic and Anna Nicole for both its half-baked playschool production and its execrable libretto. And how Gregory has converted a perfectly decent suite of music into musical mess is a mystery.One flicker of inventiveness (though diffusely delivered) was to be found when, in a jokily (and I use that word very lightly) turbulent scene, the choruses weave fugues in the manner of the turba from Bach's passions. But this was a fleeting and feeble ray of light amid a vast downpour of crap. I shan't name the participants. Most of them are far better than this. I will simply mention that the director of all this gaucherie was the head of the Southbank, Jude Kelly. That she expended her time and judgment on this work proves that the Arts Council were very wise to stem the flow of funds to her pot and reminds us how strange it is that she is at the head of one of the world's finest classical music venues.",https://theartsdesk.com/new-music/piccard-space-queen-elizabeth-hall,
724,"Fidelio, Royal Opera House",Fidelio,Royal Opera House,2011-03-29,David Nice,"I have no problem at all with updating Beethoven's early-19th-century paean to love and liberty: there are any number of tyrants and prisoners of conscience to whom its universal message could apply. But in this revival staged by Daniel Dooner, Flimm's prison - where and when, I'm not quite sure, though the ladies' print dresses and hairdos suggest the 1950s - has no meaningful relationships, moves and gestures to fill it which couldn't be set in any period, the odd pointed revolver excepted.It also means that Nina Stemme as Leonore, in male disguise to discover the whereabouts of her political-prisoner spouse, has to start out wearing an unbecoming peaked cap, and as I've belatedly discovered from catching up with The West Wing and the ineffable character of White House Press Secretary CJ Cregg, no handsome woman - no man, for that matter - looks good in a peaked cap. Well, things were just as bad for Charlotte Margiono in Deborah Warner's Glyndebourne production, looking for all the world like EastEnders' Phil Mitchell in a woolly hat. But Warner made you care about the characters from the start, even if you still couldn't quite believe that gaoler's daughter Marzelline would really fall for a plump eunuch.Here, though, I found all the usual frustrations with Beethoven's lighter numbers - no Mozart he - compounded by sheer agonising impatience with characters who do or express little. Elizabeth Watts's Marzelline soars, though she's less clear in mid-range, and Stemme eventually pulls her sizeable vibrato into focus; but all the rifle-polishing, rose-shredding and chair-kicking are done as if in a blocking textbook, without motivation or conviction. There's further inequality when Kurt Rydl's Rocco (pictured above with Stemme and Watts) - rather more veteran spread tones here, a solid performance as always - seems as if he could crush his tyrannical master Don Pizarro (a characterisation of little fire or conviction from an ambling, pinstripe-suited John Wegner) with a single blast of his resonant bass. Co-ordination with Mark Elder's rhythmically tight orchestra isn't strong, either - maybe something to do with the last-minute replacing of ailing Kirill Petrenko, but Elder knows the score - and further frays the edges of an otherwise strong-form Royal Opera Chorus (not a great start, dramatically, for them, either - they're already out in the light when the music suggests them moving from the shadows).Near-pitch-blackness, on the other hand, is the one moment of grace for Robert Israel's dwarfing designs: when Florestan sings ""God, what darkness here"" at the beginning of Act II, you believe him. And especially so when Elder sets up the sombre hues with such concentration and Wottrich (pictured below right with Stemme and Wegner) opens out so thrillingly on his first note. His phrasing is more distinctive and even than Stemme's in her big set piece ""Abscheulicher"", where you feel the dark-hued soprano is getting rather heavy for manouevre around the cantilena; but she does pull out several full, if not totally centred, top notes both here and in the final ensemble. I felt no frisson, all the same, when she pulls her gun on Pizarro with the immortal cry, ""First kill his wife"". Much more striking was the security of soprano and tenor in their insane duet.The final scene starts well with another vintage bass, Willard White, in strikingly good voice and dignified of presence as ever; vocally, the shared moment of happiness makes a decent noise. But who can believe in the stagey antics of the crowd, and least of all their stilted jigging around at the end while ""guards"" perform a statue-desecration and Pizarro-garrotting of shocking ineptitude? I was reminded of the guillotine shenanigans in the Guildhall students' production of Poulenc's Dialogues des Carmélites the other week. But this is the Royal Opera House, and its usual standards don't prepare one for such gaucheries. Clearly there have been worse Fidelios recently. But still, an opera which really needs all the force of the singers' conviction, not to mention much tighter work with the conductor, comes across as static and routine.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/fidelio-royal-opera-house,
725,"Intermezzo, Scottish Opera, Theatre Royal, Glasgow",Intermezzo,Scottish Opera,2011-03-27,David Nice,"A glittering, gaudy surface and an epic, sometimes disturbing underbelly are what many of Klimt’s canvases and Richard Strauss’s autobiographical bourgeois comedy of marital misunderstanding have in common. It was the main idea of Wolfgang Quetes’s Scottish Opera extravaganza to bring those mythic resonances in harmony with the realist conversation-piece aspect of the opera. But you don’t do Intermezzo without a capricious heroine of huge charisma like Glyndebourne charmers Elisabeth Söderström and Felicity Lott. Any British opera-goers heard of Anita Bader? You will now.Bader makes very much her own the role of Christine Storch, a feisty stage personification of Pauline Strauss, the moody dame the composer has his stage alter ego undiplomatically describe as a prickly hedgehog with a lovely inside. While Söderström and Lott at Glyndebourne had immortal glamour, there’s more than a hint of Bavarian hausfrau about Munich-trained Bader’s sharp-featured funny face. But she’s immensely graceful with her arms and hands, and the voice is of the warmer, less cutting Straussian variety, not always pitch perfect but never strident (hard to believe she’s sung Turandot, but then the top notes do ring out). And the physical warmth and ease between her Pauline and long-suffering, if just a tad complacent, Robert Storch - the rugged, broad-phrasing young baritone Roland Wood - in their opening spats ease the audience into realistic, complex comedy from the start.It darkens, of course. The premise is an incident which befell the Strausses in 1902, 22 years before the opera was composed, when Pauline opened a letter addressed from a Berlin good-time girl to her famous husband in familiar terms, only to discover that the silly thing had mixed him up with a mere Kapellmeister, Josef Stransky (Stroh in the opera). To make the work more symmetrical, Strauss gives Christine a fraught flirtation with the opportunistic young Baron Lummer which whiles away most of the first act until the fatal letter arrives. It's a balance wryly observed in this production, where Bader's Christine talks to a photograph of her husband on the dining table but is not averse to clasping hands with Nicky Spence's resonant charming oaf Lummer (pictured below on the toboggan run with Bader's Christine) at a distance; when hubby returns late in Act II, their entwining of fingers takes place at closer quarters on a smaller table for two.The approach is of a still-underestimated originality. In the opera’s 14 scenes, Strauss reaches the apogee of the conversational style he had first unleashed in Der Rosenkavalier; while in the interludes he plumbs the depths of the characters’ psyches. Too trivial a subject for so weighty a burden? The composer thought not, wondering if anything could be more serious than married life, and even Rosenkavalier poet-librettist Hugo von Hofmannsthal, who had shuddered at the initial proposition, leaving Strauss to write the libretto himself, had to admit that the depths had been plumbed with admirable integrity. It’s true that the score is a bit like a clever, affectionate spaniel that wants to lick you all over in the first act, and then breeds a legion of hysterical puppies in the second, but if you relish that, as Scottish Opera music director Francesco Corti so exuberantly and yet professionally did, it works.From my seat towards the front of the stalls, with the orchestra jutting out beneath the stage, balances were a bit awry between voices and players; I felt Corti could have gone for a lighter touch in some of the one-to-ones, though his interludes were flawlessly vivid, and he brought out the heart and soul of Strauss’s loveliest tribute to his wife, the great  ""Dreaming by the Fireside"" rhapsody. Praise be to Quetes for standing back and letting the purple and gold of the shimmering dropcloths do all the complementary work; my last experience of Intermezzo was David Fielding’s at Garsington, and that drowned the music out in cheap gags.The basic premise as embodied in Manfred Kaderk's efficient designs is obvious but effective: Klimt’s lavishly costumed lovers of The Kiss (pictured left), locked in a passionate embrace, are torn asunder – as Robert and Christine are, first by physical distance, then by the threat of divorce proceedings – only to join again as the Storches slip off to the bedroom at the end and the maid listens at the door. The Art Nouveau designs dominate every interior, at times complementing the bourgeois villa where the action begins and ends, at others clashing with the seedy reality of the digs Pauline finds for her not-so-bright or promising student baron, and twice taking us to a none-too-realistic outdoors, first on a toboggan run and then to the Prater where a crazed Robert is not so quietly going mad at his wife’s inexplicable behaviour.Here Strauss tries – and rather overdoes – a parallel with the cosmic storm of his previous, massive fairytale opera Die Frau ohne Schatten; and in fact the novel breaking-up of the stage as well as the fin-de-siècle luminosities reminded me of nothing so much as another dream-world, the Peter Stein production of Debussy’s Pelléas et Mélisande. That's the first great opera with extensive interludes, a mythic portrait this time of an unhappy marriage. Was Strauss aware of the parallels and at times having a little parodistic fun at their expense? Who knows? The main thing is that all the characters, from the smallest to the toughest, should be believable, and though it looked on paper as if Scottish Opera would not be using much homegrown talent, its young artists – Rebecca Afonwy-Jones and Michel de Souza, last seen in the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama's Prokofiev War and Peace – take smart cameos stylishly.The funniest performance comes from Jeremy Huw Williams's card-playing Councillor of Commerce, a man far more neurotic and troublesome than he imagines his beloved conductor’s wife to be, though with a good conscience; and there’s beautiful, baby-tenor phrasing from this new Spence who sounds as if he might well match Toby as a fine Britten singer. Sarah Redgwick makes a wise, Germanically fluent maid (Anna, the name of the Strauss's trusty servant, who despite Pauline's tantrums was still with them in their old age). It’s the trio of Bader, Wood and Corti, though, which walks off with the purple passages, and as the married couple's not-too-saccharine duet of reconciliation soars, so do our spirits at the end of an act which can pall without this level of focused energy. Well, mine certainly did, for I’m sure this is a piece which is hated as much as loved. All it takes is a little understanding, and that this straightforward but vivacious evening shows to the hilt.OVERLEAF: MORE RICHARD STRAUSS ON THEARTSDESK",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/intermezzo-scottish-opera-theatre-royal-glasgow,

Inspiring three operas apiece from both Handel and Vivaldi, as well as works from Lully, Haydn, Caccini and Rameau, its vivid stories of love, magic and revenge were plundered freely by composers for the better part of two centuries. It’s a rich seam of works, and one the Barbican is celebrating with a triptych of concerts.

727,"The Return of Ulysses, ENO, Young Vic",The Return of Ulysses,ENO,2011-03-25,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"Wars have no end. Soldiers may come home, battlefields may be vacated, peace treaties signed, but scars remain. The violence of combat has a way of revisiting itself on the victors and vanquished and ravaging soul and state. This was the message of Benedict Andrews's new production of Monteverdi's The Return of Ulysses for the English National Opera at the Young Vic, which sees Ithaca as a mutilated world, inhabited by a suicidal wife, a brutalised soldier and a society grotesquely drunk on its own supremacy.The curtain lifts on a grieving widow. Penelope circles her cage, a shiny modern glass box of a condo (set design: Börkur Jónsson), staving off madness and rage, fending off three vile suitors whose capacity for sexual violence appears about to spill over at any moment and two well-meaning maids who try valiantly with reason and sympathy to nurse her back to mental health. In front of her bed, war rages on a flat-screen TV.Andrews drags the sermonising Prologue into this fug of woe. As Time, Fortune and Love swoop down to torture Human Frailty, their faces disfigured by latex balaclavas, are we not meant to think that life and its many cruel abuses are a war itself? In this production, life is nothing but a war - a domesticated war playing out on a domesticated battlefield.Like much opera of the 17th century, bowing dutifully as it does to the word over the music, Monteverdi seems happy to accompany the drama, not to lead, push, manipulate or exaggerate its meaning but merely to punctuate and intensify the truths and realities already being expressed in the libretto (beautifully translated by Christopher Cowell). The vocal score comes across as little more than fortified speech, dominated as it is by recitative and terse melodies (and only intermittently by anything that might resemble 18th-century aria - though there are some fine little ensembled numbers). All of which obviates the need for impressive tessitura or much puff from the singers, and allows instead for immense subtlety and emotional and dramatic range.There was great depth of talent - young and old - in the many supporting roles, whose beautifully and richly observed quotidien activity, spread all over the stage, was videoed and relayed on two large screens (video design: Sean Bacon). There was Ruby Hughes as the mesmerising puppet-master Minerva (who unnervingly shadows Penelope throughout the opera), Samuel Boden as a fantastically lyrical and knuckle-headed suitor Anfinomo and Thomas Hobbs in a touching turn as Ulysses's son, Telemaco. Outstanding among the older cast members were Diana Montague's phlegmatic old nurse, Ericlea, and Nigel Robson's sympathetic, but never ingratiating, everyman, Eumete. Hobbs deserves particular praise for his part in the second most moving moment of the night: the stunningly quiet reunion with his father Ulysses (Tom Randle).The very beginning set the bar high, though, with Pamela Helen Stephen's astonishingly honest opening outpouring of sorrow (informed no doubt by the recent death of her husband Richard Hickox). As Stephen's voice lowered and darkened, the small period orchestra (marshalled well by Jonathan Cohen throughout) thickening, the music weaving Penelope's web, a thick fog of grief descended on the theatre.And then there was the consummate Randle, singing without blemish throughout. His Ulysses is a deeply traumatised, semi-sane man, who ends up excising his demons through an act of extreme brutality. I kept being reminded of Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker; is this what happens to Sergeant William James? The ambiguity of the role, the way Randle trips up our moral compass by switching so suddenly from pitiable victim to repulsive murderer, comes as a thrilling shock.What Andrews seems to have realised is that, 400 years before the rise of the contemporary docu-opera, at the dawn of this fragile new art form, here in Monteverdi's The Return of Ulysses is a fully formed psychologically accurate testament to the real world in all its detailed glory. Andrews figures of myth live and breath. They talk to the nature of personal relations in a state at war better than anything else I have seen. The emotions ring true, the activity quickens the pulse, the words strike the heart.

731,"Aida, Royal Opera House",Aida,Royal Opera House,2011-03-11,David Nice,"What kind of Aida would you prefer: one in which singing actors stretched to the limits find Verdi's human volcano of emotions beneath the cod-Egyptian rubble, or a stand-and-deliver production with a stalwart cast of beaten-bronze voices? Having had a taste at least of the former once in my life, I wasn't very happy to succumb to the latter in this Covent Garden revival. It was the wall of sound in the big Act II ensemble which made me at least willing to be convinced.And then I wasn't. And then I was again. It's that kind of a show, a reminder of the bad old repertoire days at the Royal Opera after the total work of art, love it or hate it, of Anna Nicole. On an ugly, selectively lit set which proves unreadable right from the revolving wall at the start, singers who can't, or won't, act make actors and dancers who can seem daftly hyperactive in what amounts to ancient carry-on as usual with extra bodies and blood (did the Egyptians indulge in human sacrifice? A whole article devoted to the subject in the programme doesn't say. But where are we, anyway, and who cares?). It does seem bizarre that David McVicar, a director whose sensitivity and visual flair have created fully realised worlds in operas as different as Giulio Cesare, Der Rosenkavalier and Adriana Lecouvreur, to name but three, should be so stumped by the mainstream rep's last hoary melodrama to contain superb music that he doesn't appear to have come up with a coherent mise en scène.But then you never know if the kind of singers making up the so-called ""A cast"" of this revival would be amenable to direction anyway. It gets off to an unpromising start with that wall in the Prelude - plunging the auditorium into darkness didn't incline the first-night audience to listen to the pianissimo violin phrases depicting our Ethiopian heroine - and Roberto Alagna having to tackle the notoriously difficult ""Celeste Aida"" minutes later. This Radames isn't the kind of warrior who'd let a grande amoreget in the way of military ambition; the vocal armour doesn't come off for a minute. Alagna started his career loud, developed a few scruples over the years, and now is loud, if lustrous and occasionally excitingly sharp, again. As for the acting, it's raise the left arm, raise the right arm, raise them both and bring them together (which by Act III becomes place left leg on ramp and down, right leg up and down, step up with both).Then there are the redoubtable mezzo/contralto Olga Borodina (pictured below on the right), finding  plenty of vocal colour as the Egyptian princess who loves him in vain but nothing more in the way of interaction - always the real Verdian thing, though - and Ukrainian newcomer Liudmila Monastyrska (pictured below left) as her slave and abhorred love rival, who probably might act a bit if she'd had the time, but was having to replace a pregnant Micaela Carosi at the very last moment (doesn't an expectant mother know in good time when the singing has to stop?). I'd like to see once again a consummate singer-actress like the African-American Adina Aaron, my brief brush with the dramatic possibilities of the role in an otherwise conventional Savonlinna production, who conjured the ideal vision of a proud princess having to assume the humility of a slave; maybe ""B cast"" audiences will get that with Latonia Moore. But this was some house debut as far as the voice went. Monastyrska's lyric-dramatic soprano, both big and warm, is laser-beam powerful in ensembles and duets, but also capable of the softest nuances which multiply as this schizoid role progresses.That she did not perhaps have the most supportive and alert conductor in Fabio Luisi seemed to be confirmed by his problems with Alagna, though the tenor may be notoriously hard to catch. Orchestral colour could be bewitching in the Nile music and the dances, however flaky the choreography, less good in cushioning and floating the singers in their longer lines until we reached a surprisingly tender and elevated final scene where the lovers expire ever so seraphically in the underground vault. You imagine it might take a long time for Monastyrska to run out of breath; the technique seemed fairly unassailable, and though she's scheduled to sing Verdi's Lady Macbeth next, maybe it's already time for the major houses to think about the path to Brünnhilde and Elektra.With two other fine voices, Vitalij Kowaljow's High Priest and Brindley Sherratt's King, almost smothered by silly costumes and war paint, and the choruses musically nuanced but insufficiently differentiated - we need to know exactly who the priests are - it was left to Michael Volle's powerful, perhaps un-Italianate but infallibly secure Amonasro to inject some semblance of believable drama. I guess he must have made Monastyrska momentarily feel like she meant something to someone else on stage, so close did he clutch her in the crucial father-daughter duet of Act III, and his first appearance in the middle of all that ludicrous blood-sacrifice pomp raised the drama, which had only sparked just a little in the Aida-Amneris confrontation, to a level from which it didn't descend until after the interval.Otherwise, you'd have thought that second time around might have been the ideal opportunity for McVicar and his team to have a rethink on intent and design. As it is, this Aida as a concept is hardly more engaging than the shallow Elijah Moshinsky farrago previously seen at the Garden, and not nearly as beautiful to look at as the much-maligned Robert Wilson production which came in between. For all its fatal stillness when the music blazed, that might have been more successfully wheeled out for the present team of world-class singers. As it is, Covent Garden will have to try again. Or just do Aida in concert, which I'd be quite happy to hear with these ladies, at least.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/aida-royal-opera-house-0,
732,"Dialogues des Carmélites, Guildhall School of Music & Drama",Dialogues des Carmélites,Guildhall School of Music & Drama,2011-03-03,David Nice,"Let's begin at the end. Isn't the nuns-to-the-scaffold scene which concludes Poulenc's ultimate testament of doubt and faith the deepest, most heart-wrenching finale in all opera? It even has the edge over Richard Strauss's Rosenkavalier trio and duet, in that the singers often end up in tears as well as the audience. If my eyes were dry at the end of the Guildhall School's valiant staging, that's not because the production lacked the necessary clarity, imagination and motion, nor was it due to any dearth of good voices. But clearly something wasn't quite right.Perhaps it was a question of space, both visual and aural. The musical space I'd regard as the cumulative inward glow of this often very meditative and outwardly uneventful score. Clive Timms admirably gave more than the usual momentum to propel us through the initial crisis in the de la Force household, April 1789, which eventually sends the unstable Blanche off to the Carmelite convent at Compiègne. Then the score needs to settle, to intimate what the spiritual life of the nuns is all about, between the upheavals, the doubts and the crisis; more orchestral introspection is needed than we get here.The libretto, adapted from George Bernanos's play - which I'd quite like to see done straight - has its eloquent moments, though not perhaps enough to persuade an outsider of the religious options during a time of trouble in the way that, for me, Xavier Beauvois's masterpiece of a movie Of Gods and Men so movingly achieves (both film and opera deal with the rights and wrongs of martyrdoms, of how to stay true to oneself in the face of death). So persuasive faith is left to the halos of strings, the piercingly beautiful woodwind solos, none of which functioned at their best last night in the rather dead zone of the Guildhall Theatre. Trumpets and horns, too, were proving intractable in the conflict music on the first night, though maybe they'll settle over the next four performances.Vocal quality was there from the start. Anna Patalong commands the lyric and neurotic impulses of fear-stricken Blanche with even tone throughout the range, though the lower register needs a little more power and the upper more reining in; something of the focus I fancied I heard when I first encountered this so obviously gifted soprano, in George Crumb's Ancient Voices of Children at the Barbican just over a year ago, seems to have been lost. But her envious outbursts against the loveable Sister Constance - a bright, clear performance from Sophie Junker - make their mark, and Blanche's abject self-hatred when she flees the vow of martyrdom and hides in her dead father's Paris home duly unsettles.Director Stephen Barlow pulls out the ultimate stops as Blanche rejoins the sisterhood on the scaffold as the last of the martyrs. The image of the shattered carriage window which launches and dominates the work, variously lit as burning coals and spider's web, slides back and a self-respecting soul is left alone in light, arms raised. I can see the point, but that's my other question mark about space, this time the inner state of grace made visible - it really needs to be there for the whole of the ""Salve Regina"" sung by the sisterhood (pictured right) as, one by one, they succumb to the fall of the blade (the sound of which, incidentally, was not as shocking as it can be). Barlow echoes, up to a point, the unforgettable symbolic gestures of Robert Carsen's peerless production: here the nuns let their prayer-clasped hands fall to their sides as they ""die"" at the front of the stage, while the guillotine and a not very convincing group of revolting peasants do their stuff, or rather some rather indecipherable kind of stuff, at the back. This would surely work better as open space for all the other women's liberation, too.Otherwise, atmospheric use is made of a revolving oblong space for the shelter of both the de la Forces' Paris house and the convent, sparsely but imaginatively furnished in David Farley's economical designs and well lit by Declan Randall - though the singers' faces are sometimes in shadow. Intimacy is this production's great virtue over the vast spaces filled in ENO and La Scala productions (I'm assuming the opera has never been staged at Glyndebourne, which would be the perfect house for it). Still, putting a wimple on a woman makes visages difficult to tell apart at any distance, so you're glad the libretto has the characters address each other by name as often as it does, and the casting's great strength is that all the voices sound different - even when not attractive, or difficult to imagine in future roles, like Sylvie Bedouelle's Mother Marie and Sky Ingram's Madame Lidoine. But both are clearly delineated dramatically - you don't doubt the new prioress's strength or purpose, or her less flexible opponent's late moment of grace when she realises her future is not on the scaffold. The men are less good with the French but generally dependable if not as individual.Dodgy techniques in some of the smaller roles make me wonder, as I always have on visits to the Guildhall, exactly what's being taught on a practical level. But this production has a higher quotient of promising talent than any other I've seen here, and to match Patalong's assurance there's another voice of distinction in the very mature sounding Cátia Moreso, heading in a direction somewhere between the cut of Felicity Palmer and Regina Resnik. The death in agony and doubt of her imposing, if occasionally slightly over-ferocious Madame de Croissy (pictured above left with Patalong as Blanche) is another highlight in an evening that's never less than engaging. Just don't go expecting it to be overwhelmingly moving and you may get more out of it than you expected.Watch the finale scene of Dialogues des Carmélites in Robert Carsen's production from the Teatro all Scala, Milan",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/dialogues-des-carm%C3%A9lites-guildhall-school-music-drama,
733,"The Mikado, English National Opera",The Mikado,English National Opera,2011-02-27,alexandra Coghlan,"At 25 years old, Jonathan Miller’s Mikado may be more Grande Dame than ingénue, but it still has a Charleston kick in its step and a shimmy in its pearls. Styled and stylised, chic and slick, it's as far from the operetta’s ubiquitous am-dram incarnations as from the Japan of the original. Yet just as the Minimalist decor and monochrome palette of an Art Deco interior prove unforgiving to the smallest hint of dust or casual clutter, so the sharp lines of this production provide little cover for the relaxed paunch or middle-aged spreadings of a revival.Bathed in a lava flow of white lacquer, Stefanos Lazaridis’s set is still a thing of beauty, albeit one best appreciated through dark glasses. Embracing its kitschy 1930s setting, everything is brighter and larger than life – from an oversized Martini glass casually deposited on the (white) grand piano, to the gramophone and double bass (yes, white as well) hovering wallflower-like at the back. The opening tableau of Act II with its kimono-clad chorus drew applause – a monochrome fantasy of female charm – and Ko-Ko’s first entrance is a carnival of visual excess, with a chorus of dancing bell boys (“with his Nancy on his knee”) all but stealing the show.Yet with Miller himself back in charge for this anniversary celebration, I can’t help feeling that things could have been just a little tighter dramatically. The pinched period accents season the delicious humour of Gilbert’s dialogue, but for many also seem to inhibit. Alfie Boe – surely a natural fit as Nanki-Poo – seems lost behind his kiss curl and white make-up, delivering his lines in a gripped, Kermit-like patter with little pause for comedy. When you draw neither a laugh nor a groan for, “...but she was betrothed to her guardian Ko-Ko, a cheap tailor, and I saw at once that my suit was hopeless”, something is just not right.Act II saw a little loosening up from Boe, but still little sign of the wide-eyed, good-natured innocence that Nanki-Poo must project if he is to balance Ko-Ko’s wheedling, weasling campery. Richard Suart’s Ko-Ko (pictured right) is a creature honed over many years, and pitched just on the right side of hysteria. Doing violence to his vowels with the gusto of a drunken Boris Johnson, his convulsions of body and tongue are outdone solely by the satire of his self-penned Little List. The present incarnation features among its unlucky stars Wayne Rooney, Berlusconi (a rhyme of “hunger” and “bunga bunga” drew cheers), “those hacking journalists”, and of course the newly ubiquitous “coalitionists”.Sophie Bevan, making her role debut as Yum-Yum, is as pert as a supermodel’s bottom and every bit as enticing. Matching beautifully secure vocals with girlish giggling aplenty, she carries an otherwise rather underpowered trio of little maids with vivacity and plenty of backbiting wit.Less successful is Anne Marie Owens’s Katisha, who captures some of the stately pathos of the role, but little of its darker comedy. Projection was an issue throughout, but particularly in the glorious closing duet “There is beauty in the bellow of the blast”. While hefting a voice of such weight around patter faces all the challenges of Richard Griffiths in a ballet studio, these cannot be ignored if the humour isn’t crisply and vehemently pointed.This is still a supremely good show. Small details – the headless, dancing men in the “I am so proud” trio, Ko-Ko’s antics with a maid in the airing cupboard, the tiny chipmunk squeaks of the female chorus – all speak to the lively quality of the production. Yes, there’s currently still a looseness to the flow of onstage action, and a lack of fizz from Peter Robinson's pit, that blots the lean clarity of Miller’s vision.

734,"Il Trovatore, Welsh National Opera, Cardiff",Il Trovatore,Welsh National Opera,2011-02-25,stephen Walsh,"Verdi’s Il Trovatore, the WNO season brochure assures us, “is Italian opera at its most passionate and full-blooded”. But you could sit through this revival of Peter Watson’s seven-year-old production and overlook the fact. Always understated (to put it kindly), with age it has retreated further into its shell. The singers face front and largely ignore one another; the soldiers seem to have taken orders from the latest tottering Middle Eastern tyrant not to fire on their own people. There are no flames to trouble Azucena’s conscience; no blood, not much passion. It’s a very small volcano in a very remote corner of Spain.Few would claim that Trovatore is Verdian theatre at its most visual: its impact is almost entirely musical. But that’s no reason to shut one’s eyes altogether. Unfortunately Tim Hatley’s blank, dimly lit high walls give virtually no purchase for the imagination, and might as well, frankly, not be there. Moving them around, though, seems enough of a problem to necessitate an interminable pause after each scene, so that Verdi’s fast-moving dramaturgy stutters at every turn.Nothing that Watson does with his singers speeds it up very much. Mostly they stand and deliver, their eyes firmly on the conductor. No wonder Leonora confuses Luna and Manrico in the semi-darkness; she barely looks at either of them. And no wonder, one might cynically suggest, Azucena once upon a time threw the wrong baby into the fire. The production might almost be making a point about mistaken choices, but I suspect that would be to flatter a severe case of under-direction.How much does all this matter, provided you get the four great singers Caruso used to insist was all Trovatore needed? The answer is that even great singers need choreographing once you put them on the stage. The Italian critic Gabriele Baldini thought that Verdi’s entire drama was in the music, and what you saw onstage was Wagner’s “deeds of music made visible”; but after all they do have to be made visible.The Welsh National Opera cast is certainly strong vocally. Katia Pellegrino has the potential to be an outstanding Leonora. She has real brilliance in her top register and a beautiful sound throughout the range, needing perhaps a touch more weight in the chest voice. Above all, though, she needs to liven up her stage presence, acquire some spontaneity of movement and gesture, catch her lover’s eye more often, get some exercise around the set. Not that Gwyn Hughes Jones sets her the best possible example. Ludicrously costumed in tight hose and what might be a male maternity shirt, he looks – and occasionally sounds – like a stock Italian tenor, which may actually be no bad thing in Trovatore under happier, more athletic circumstances. Here he sings a very acceptable Manrico, conventional in almost all respects (not excluding the regulation unwritten top C at the end of “Di quella pira”), but like Pellegrino largely disengaged.David Kempster’s Luna is stronger than this dramatically: handsome, brooding, and with a finely villainous but not excessively diabolical presence. His singing on the first night was somewhat dry, but he was recovering from bronchitis, which is certainly no condition in which to sing middle-period Verdi. Veronica Simeoni likewise has the makings of a forceful Azucena under more pointed direction. At present she comes and goes, disappointingly tepid in “Stride la vampa” – always a test, starting absolutely cold – but warming up in her scenes with Manrico and especially Luna. She too would respond, I suspect, to more muscular direction.Not for the first time on the Wales Millennium Centre stage, some of the best singing comes from the WNO chorus, excellent in the opening scene with David Soar’s exceptionally well-sung Ferrando (pictured above), superb later in the anvil chorus and the irresistible “Squilli e cheggi”, with majestic brass-playing. At these moments the conductor Andrea Licata is plainly in his element. At other times he seems slightly one-paced and short on brio, which may go to show that inertia is catching.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/il-trovatore-welsh-national-opera-cardiff,
735,"Anna Nicole, Royal Opera",Anna Nicole,Royal Opera,2011-02-17,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"Look past the cum buckets, the trucker pussy, the fuck you-ing and cunt-hungry beasting (librettist Richard Thomas's words, not mine), the mountainous titties and cheap promotional candy that had been confected for the legions of rubbishy celebrity opera virgins scattered in the Royal Opera House audience at last night's world premiere and you will find a profoundly conservative, and mostly not unattractive, new opera in Anna Nicole.Most conservative was the story. Put-upon female has life destroyed for evening's entertainment - ie, classic operatic fallen-woman porn. Ask Violetta, Lulu, Kundry or Lucrezia Borgia about it. Last night it was the turn of big-titted glamour model and professional gold digger Anna Nicole to have her tragic low life feasted upon by Royal Opera House high life.Her journey up from her ""young, single, flat-chested and in debt"" Texas white-trash roots to her 89-year-old-billionaire-marrying infamy was a mixed blessing. Many of Thomas's try-hard attempts to get down with the kids and be funny (and he's failed at this before) were nauseating. As was the over-enthusiastic laughter from the audience at every ""fuck you"". They obviously thought that Thomas was delivering some sort of daringly radical assault on the propriety of the world of opera, when in truth there's probably more bare tits and dirty chat in any given season at Covent Garden and the ENO than on many porn channels. Having said that, every now and again Thomas does strike gold. Lines like ""We are the restless, breastless masses"", sung by a quartet of girls readying themselves for plastic surgery, and Anna Nicole's Imelda Marcos moment (my favourite song of the evening), ""That's the sound of Jimmy Choo, ooo-ooo-ooo"", are unforgettably good.Whenever Thomas's versification and humour went awry, however, (which was often), there were great distractions to be had in director Richard Jones and set designer Miriam Buether's celebration of American Eighties and Nineties kitsch. Their oversized neon world, deliciously bathed and epically lit in pinks, blues and oranges by Jones's genius long-time lighting designer Mimi Jordan Sherin, were never anything but thrilling.Interest nosedived in the second half as we processed to Anna Nicole's grave. Thomas's libretto buckled under the pressure to be soulful and give wider meaning to the plethora of tragic events to befall Anna Nicole and her family that we rattle through soap-style. A designated conscience of the opera, Anna Nicole's mother, Virgie (strongly sung by Susan Bickley), offers up insights like ""shit happens, then you die"". The increasing poverty of the libretto was doubly embarrassing as the second half was where Mark-Anthony Turnage's music began to achieve some genuine emotional power.That isn't to say that, musically speaking, one was shortchanged in the first half. For, though it is a conservative score, often clear in colour and meaning, often following the lead of the words, often dividing into ariosi, duet, chorus or lyrically propulsive recitative in familiar fashion, rarely leaving a jazzed-up 1940s classical American idiom, it certainly sustains our interest. There is no let-up of steadily shifting but easily recognisable vernacular sounds and forms. Conductor Antonio Pappano and the Opera House orchestra worked hard to make the handovers between jazz band, drum kit and orchestra seamless.The singing and acting was exemplary. Anna Nicole could not have received a more sympathetic characterisation from Eva-Maria Westbroek. Alan Oke (J Howard Marshall II, pictured above right with Westbroek) was a surprisingly subtle and winning billionaire.Gerald Finlay (pictured left with Westbroek) pulls back from Thomas's crudely villainous set-up for lawyer Stern - though, poor thing, still has to deliver Thomas's ludicrous lines. Of the minor roles, there are two memorably loveable hicks, Grant Doyle's Billy, Anna Nicole's first husband, and Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts's lap-dance punter, Trucker.For any students of American popular culture, much of the joy was watching the underrated cultural artefacts of America - plastic surgery, KFC, Walmart - and their hick sponsors receiving privileged hard study and musical paean with a degree of sincerity and love. As this love turned into an all-too-familiar indictment, one had to retreat into the glories of the set, lighting and music. Society, capitalism, America, lawyers, the media, men all exploited Anna Nicole, claims the opera. But wouldn't it have been more interesting to explore the possibility that Anna Nicole exploited society? And had a great time doing it?",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/anna-nicole-royal-opera,
736,"Parsifal, English National Opera",Parsifal,English National Opera,2011-02-17,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"Some of you will know that Wagner and I haven't been seeing eye to eye of late. Last year's Tannhäuser I believed was the end of the road for the two of us. Not quite. With one of the most celebrated Wagner productions of the past two decades returning to the English National Opera last night - Nikolaus Lehnhoff's Parsifal - I decided to give him a final chance. My whole mind, body and soul was primed to repel it, yet I came out almost blubbing.The revelation didn't come immediately - nothing in Wagner comes immediately - though it didn't take long for the music to start having its effect. I'd forgotten how gentle the score to Wagner's final opera is. How conventionally ingratiating it is. How it laps against you, lightly soothing, lightly stinging. How little it tries to suffocate or overwhelm like Tristan. When the music burns - and the English National Opera orchestra glowed gloriously last night in the hands of conductor Mark Wigglesworth - it is as a cinder: static, dark, concentrated. It's an altogether unique musical experience, quite unlike your conventional breathless Wagner - though the second act conforms more to type.The quality of the singing, too, made itself felt early. John Tomlinson's Gurnemanz had us eating out of his hand, that familiar booming voice giving the most natural and convincing shape and fluency to his key early storytelling. Iain Paterson was a harrowing Amfortas, his song of woe sending him spinning across stage like a sot. Both Stuart Skelton's Parsifal (pictured below) and Jane Dutton's Kundry gained in power the more they were given to do. Tom Fox's Klingsor was perhaps the least memorable of the ensemble, partly because the Act Two setting - veiled by a giant pelvic screen - was so very memorable. Act Three was incredible, Tomlinson (pictured bottom), Skelton and Paterson singing and acting out of their skins as relationships reach their emotionally fraught conclusions.Yet all of this would have been for naught if the toxic moral dichotomy thrown up by the libretto had not been tackled and undermined. For make no mistake, at its heart, this is a tale about goodies and baddies. And the goodies are the baddies and the baddies the goodies. No amount of special pleading can hide that fact. The He-Man costumes certainly didn't. In the good corner, you have an army of enfeebled Aryan Christians seeking an idiot savant to replenish their powers; in the bad, a bullied outcast, Klingsor, and a heathen (ie, Jewish) slut, Kundry, who is converted to Christianity but who, ultimately, (because she is heathen-Jew) must die. A potent (and influential) brew of misogyny, racism and Aryan triumphalism.So Lehnhoff's complication of Wagner's directions is a relief and in the end a miracle of interpretation. Where do the war-weary army start their journey? In a gunshot-marked concrete chamber, demolished chimney holes eyeing us up from the top. Why are these German heroes in a concentration camp? Are they trapped by their present? Or their past? And what of the source of evil, Kundry? Lehnhoff tries to free her from the hysterical female straitjacket in which Wagner clearly wants to keep her and, in Act Three, even suggests her as a saviour - in explicit contradiction to Wagner's instruction for her to die.It's not all hunky-dory. Parsifal is still an opera where it's better to forget causes if you wish to find conclusions moving. Even in this production, the first two acts are problematic. How can we applaud Parsifal's arrogance? How can we ignore the misogyny? How can we look upon this militaristic, racist Christian brotherhood as anything but a thoroughly nasty Waco-like cult? Lehnhoff somehow makes it possible.Kundry is key. She begins Act Two with her body submerged to her head like Beckett's Winnie. The more she questions and explores her conscience and that of those around her - the only character to do so - the more human she becomes. From her solitary head, she gains a pupa, a chrysalis and then a full human body. Her self-realisation and self-sacrifice (she is both baptised and Aryanised, her hair turning from black to blond by Act Three) trumps Parsifal's heroics.Parsifal's journey can only return the Knights to their parochial cultish preoccupations. What Kundry can offer them is true freedom: from religious strictures, from their past, from their leaders - now that their former kings Titurel (a spookily scaly green knight, Andrew Greenan) and Amfortas lie dead. The fundaments of this religious army are dashed against the rock of the true message of Good Friday that Gurnemanz proclaims to Parsifal so movingly and their realisation that Kundry's behaviour fits the self-abnegating messianic bill far better than Parsifal's.So Kundry follows the railway tracks out of their concrete home, individual soldiers and Parsifal staggering behind. Are these half-dead Jews hobbling out of Auschwitz? Are these Germans finally breaking free of their past? Certainly, they are survivors, newborns, individuals, free of their fraternal responsibilities and prejudices. Would Wagner have approved? Absolutely not. Can the music take it? Without doubt. Should we encourage this sort of fiddling? Anything that can force a Wagner divorcee like me to eat this much humble pie - to admit that Parsifal is probably after all the greatest opera ever written - is doing something pretty incredible and very right. Hell, I might even go again.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/parsifal-english-national-opera,

738,"Nixon in China, Metropolitan Opera HD Live",Nixon in China,Metropolitan Opera HD Live,2011-02-13,David Nice,"Metcentric New Yorkers tend to think an opera hasn’t achieved classic status until it arrives at their vast inner sanctum. Whereas other cities worldwide know that the inimitable Peter Sellars production of grand opera’s last masterpiece (to date) has become a virtual brand since its 1987 Houston premiere. John Adams's first, and biggest, opera was an obvious here-to-stay triumph at the Edinburgh Festival the following year, and its strengths become more apparent with the passing of time. What we celebrated last night was the way this hallucinatory musical meditation around 1972's East-meets-West hullabaloo went more global in an instant than communications-hungry Dick Nixon could have anticipated.Not that the picture (dark) or the sound (fitful) at Notting Hill's Gate Picturehouse were much to write home about: I've seen brighter, sharper Met transmissions over the years the company has been broadcasting to the world. The question now is, which Nixon will make it to DVD - this one, with only one major drawback I'll discuss shortly, or the televising of the Houston original? That had the virtue of more news footage of the original events inserted between the acts. Otherwise, the Met's presentation is slick to a fault - baritone Thomas Hampson anchors the interviews like a slightly stiff elder statesman contrasting with the likes of naughty schoolboy Sellars, the loveable Mark Morris and Adams himself in cartoon confusion about what to do with his microphone before taking up the baton again - and the interval timings are immaculate.Sellars, like the great Harry Kupfer, is an opera director who likes to supervise his composition on film, giving his own special version of Adrianne Lobel's well-wearing sets, here newly expanded for the Met, and Dunya Ramicova's costumes. So right from the first expectant crowd scene at Beijing airfield, where the music threatens Minimalism but soon dissolves it in the first of many chameleonic shifts, we got the faces as he wanted them, riveting close-ups on the Chinese members of the cast yielding to all sorts in the Met chorus, as if the momentous lines of Alice Goodman's pure poetry, ""the people are the heroes now"", might apply to everyone. And indeed the significance of the transmission on the day following the Egyptian crowd's more amiable revolution did not pass unnoticed by Sellars in interview.Scenes and lines continue to resonate: the future of China and its uneasy relations with capitalism, the sending-back to America of unknown soldiers from campaigns abroad, the mushrooming of the media. Had anything got embalmed since 1987? Possibly the old cold warrior Nixon of James Maddalena, who shouldn't really still have been singing the part even a couple of years ago at English National Opera and who now looks more like Brezhnev in his coffin, despatching what should be his racy first ""news"" monologue - think Boris Godunov on adrenalin - as well as his exhilarated toast on his first night in Beijing with a kind of rigid terror. But so many of us love him for what he was, Dick to the life, that we wanted him to get through it and found something to be thankful for in the paranoia of his later scenes.Time, then, for the role to pass to a new baritone - and who better than Russell Braun (pictured above right in the Act One finale), the one fresh revelation in the cast, catching all the dignity and honour of Chou En-lai in his big banquet speech and all the pathos of his final post-mortem (""How much of what we did was good?""), yielding to tentative hope as the exquisite solo strings of the superb Met Orchestra did the best of all possible jobs on their rising figures at the end.One thing that's become abundantly clear is how fabulously structured is Adams's whole. In Act One, the portraits of the men take us from Nixon's euphoria to Mao's enigmatic utterances - philosophy or senility, speculated an old Nixon adviser in an interval interview, hard to tell, but superbly done in heroic high-tenor declamation by the stalwart and seemingly tireless Robert Brubaker - and over to Chou. Act Two belongs to the women. First there's Pat's wonderment at an ambiguous brave new world, one of the great opera arias of the 20th century with Adams's incredible word-setting well matched to Goodman's metaphysical poetry (""Let the expression on the face/ Of the Statue of Liberty/ Change just a little; let her see/ What lies inland""). Carolann Page was fine on the premiere recording, but the part now belongs to Janis Kelly (pictured above left): another longterm operatic warrior perfectly in control both of her dangerously high-lying phrases and of her utterly believable characterisation.Adams then does a Don Carlos and moves us from private to public. Madame Mao's Gone with the Wind-inspired Red Army ballet still amuses and chills in dizzying turn: Morris has kept the dancers and their high kicks fresh, the trio of impassive Maoettes redeems a slightly woolly female chorus, Richard Paul Fink lets rip with the surreal eruption of Kissinger as capitalist villain and at last we get to hear the Met brass at full pelt - Adams the conductor seems to be relishing this - culminating in Chiang-Ch'ing's coloratura reign of terror. ENO's Judith Howarth still holds the steely palm, but the vowel-moderated delivery of Kathleen Kim (pictured right) was not without its knife-edge, paintstripping overtones.I love the heartbreak of the last act best, and its polyphonic chamber music is ideal for the close-ups of this screening (especially as Sellars still, I think, somewhat jumbles up the stage with references to what's been and what's to come which can be confusing). This is the private fall-out and exhaustion of the leading players, all masks removed; and again, in the what-next twilight following the fall of Mubarak, its open-ended questions have a special resonance. Sellars makes sure each act virtually freeze frames on a snapshot: of Nixon united with Chou in Act One, Madame Mao versus Chou in Act Two and Chou alone, awaiting his death but also possibly the dawn of hope before the blackout. ""The chill of grace/ Lies heavy on the morning grass"" is the line he leaves us with as Adams's score does a transcendental riff on Holst's Neptune. What a perfect ending to the only post-Britten opera sure of a key place in the repertoire.Watch a scene from the original Chinese Red Detachment of Women ballet",https://theartsdesk.com/film/nixon-china-metropolitan-opera-hd-live,
739,"The Portrait, Opera North",The Portrait,Opera North,2011-02-02,graham Rickson,"Based on a short story by Gogol, Alexander Medvedev’s libretto for Mieczysław Weinberg’s The Portrait was originally conceived for Shostakovich. It was subsequently passed to Weinberg, who finished his opera in 1980. It’s a bleak, Faustian tale of a struggling artist who buys the eponymous painting, after which material success is mirrored by moral collapse.You can’t help making comparisons between Weinberg’s musical style and that of his mentor. It’s audible in the staccato wind writing and angular string lines in the first act. Weinberg’s gift is for suggesting character with the most economical of means – a pinched horn solo or a splash of tuned percussion - and the scene where the artist Chartkov’s rich clients arrive to a sequence of bare-boned waltzes, marches and minuets is technically brilliant. It’s a stand-out moment, though – there are a few too many musical longueurs in the first half.A work like this needs vibrant staging to give it support, and thankfully David Pountney’s staging (the first production of a Weinberg opera in the UK) is a thing of wonder. You catch your breath during the Lamplighter’s opening soliloquy, with a battery-illuminated Nicholas Sharratt suspended high above the stage, and Dan Potra’s squalid designs easily suggest the physical chaos, disorder and dust of an artist’s studio. Paul Nilon is suitably bedraggled in his opening scenes as the artist Chartkov; after purchasing the cursed portrait (here a broken mirror) it’s compelling to watch him change physically as his self-confidence starts to grow.Chartkov remains an outsider, an innocent, and Pountney’s decision to have him literally dwarfed by grotesques on stilts is simple but brilliant. The way in which characters move is a constant diversion: Peter Savidge’s crimson-clad journalist arriving on a wire and clambering around the stage like an insect, or Katherine Broderick’s unfortunate Liza, three feet tall and spinning around on wheels. “On no account must you portray her as she is!” sings her mother, a condition which Chartkov is happy to obey.Fun though all this is, the second act offers much richer rewards. Weinberg’s music at last takes flight and there’s a richness and depth to the orchestral textures, an abundance of tolling harp and bell sounds which convey just the right sense of impending doom. Pountney’s staging drags us out of the 19th century into bright, modern light, incongruously showing us Chartkov’s portraits of a Stalin lookalike before he himself becomes an Andy Warhol figure.Having squandered his 15 minutes, Chartkov’s demise is stunningly chronicled; filmed close up by his wordless muse Psyche, his likeness projected live onto the back of the stage. It’s rare to see a singer’s face in close-up during an opera performance, and Paul Nilon is a good enough actor to make the sequence heartbreaking.This is a strange, unsettling opera. There are no significant roles for women, and most of the characters are unsympathetic. Richard Burkhard is appealing as Chartkov’s assistant Nikita, and the orchestral playing under Rossen Gergov is highly assured, making Weinberg’s score sound like standard repertoire. Watch out for the visual joke in the closing seconds.Who was Mieczysław Weinberg? Watch Davids Pountney and Fanning explain",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/portrait-opera-north,

741,"Die Zauberflöte, Royal Opera",Die Zauberflöte,Royal Opera,2011-02-02,alexandra Coghlan,"“Tumult and peace, the darkness and the light – were all like workings of one mind.” Writing almost a century after Mozart’s Die Zauberflöte, Wordsworth was still contemplating the essential duality of the sublime – that greatest of Enlightenment legacies. Rationalism, order and science, we are reminded, are only the admissible part of an age that would also beget the sinister fantasies of Romanticism and the Gothic – those most pernicious of bastard offspring. It is in exposing this messily contingent relationship between the light of truth and the shadows of superstitious doubt that David McVicar’s Die Zauberflöte still triumphs. As for moving beyond duality into resolution however – we’re still left hanging.Darkness falls, the Overture’s threefold chord unfurls, releasing the scampering string lines of the Allegro, and suddenly the gloomy aisles and balconies of the Royal Opera are punctured with lights – glowing orbs clutched with awed care. Even on a third viewing, McVicar’s opening still bewitches, not least for the elegant precision with which it dramatises the musical text. In the pit once again, Colin Davis set a pace of control rather than release, risking just a flicker of subversion in the emphatic dissent of the brass’s closing offbeat flourishes.Uncharacteristically however this pace was not to last, giving way to an Act One that felt perpetually on the back foot, with singers hauled from episode to episode by some rather officious hustling from the orchestra. Act Two did settle, arriving thankfully at “Ach, ich fühl's” in an altogether more accommodating spirit and enabling the evening’s finest moment from Kate Royal, shadow of Margaret Price hovering close by. With such a point of comparison it becomes harder to accept the seeming inevitability of first-night fisticuffs between stage and pit elsewhere; ensembles (the trio of Ladies and Christopher Maltman’s Papageno being repeat offenders) lost a full beat on several occasions, clambering back on board at cadences with ungainly rhythmic contortions.Fortunately with John McFarlane’s designs and Paule Constable’s painterly lighting there was plenty to delight the eye when the ear failed. Vertical pillars provide not only the Enlightenment absolutes of Sarastro’s temple, but also cast the shadows and frame the dark corners where Monostatos and his fellows lurk. Exposed to his greedy gaze in Act Two, we saw Royal’s Pamina stretched out asleep as if the heroine of Fuseli’s The Nightmare, with Monostatos himself the incubus gazing boldly out at us.Although dodging racial issues with a white-faced Peter Hoare Monostatos (a character designated by the libretto as black,  and rendering him more wicked uncle than would-be rapist, McVicar’s characterisation was balanced by an elegant bit of surtitling, borrowing Prospero’s “This thing of darkness I acknowledge mine” for Sarastro, reworking Monostatos implictly into a rather more interesting Caliban role.After a superb performance in the title role of Garsington’s Armida, it was Jessica Pratt (pictured above, making her Royal Opera and role debut as the Queen of the Night) who most intrigued of this new cast. While the vocal power is just about there (though she's no Diana Damrau), it’s not a part that seems to sit naturally for her either dramatically or vocally; both big arias were solid enough, but rather hollow at the top and lacking much by way of murderous rage. By contrast, Royal (pictured left) proved herself once again as an actress, making a wonderfully youthful Pamina alongside Joseph Kaiser's competent Tamino and Christopher Maltman’s Papageno – charmingly weak-willed, but whose easy comedy lacked the pathos of Simon Keenlyside's Feste-esque interpretation. Anna Devin’s Papagena showcased a bright and ringing soprano – one to look out for in the forthcoming Peter Grimes.Although perhaps lacking the “religious splendours” that Berlioz so admired in Mozart’s opera - the moral and social questions this production so decoratively sidesteps - David McVicar’s Die Zauberflöte remains an intelligently conceived and charming show. Tableaux of Sarastro’s massed sun-citizens, Tamino’s enchanted animals and the Queen’s embroidered skyscape linger in the eyes, as evocative now as in 2003.Diana Damrau sings the Queen of the Night's aria in David McVicar's Die Zauberflöte   ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/die-zauberfl%C3%B6te-royal-opera,

Figgis's Timecode (2000) was one of the world's first and most ambitious digital films. I still remember the excitement the day I saw it, the unified screen before me shattering into shards of narrative. This was the first film to sing in four simultaneously cast parts in the manner of a Bach fugue. Notwithstanding its many faults, it felt like the silver screen's Ring cycle. Last night saw Figgis try his hand at a real Gesamtkunstwerk, Donizetti's rarely heard Lucrezia Borgia (1833). Could he refashion opera as he had once done film? The ENO were dearly hoping so.When the history books on 21st century film are written, Mike Figgis will play a founding father role. Timecode (2000) was one of the world's first digital movies, a film that sang in four simultaneously cast parts in the manner of a Bach fugue. It was the silver screen's Ring. Last night saw Figgis try his hand at a real Gesamtkunstwerk, Donizetti's rarely heard Lucrezia Borgia (1833). Could he refashion opera as he had once done film? The ENO were dearly hoping so.At first it seemed like he might. Appearing on the curtain was a boldly jerky Italian documentary on the lives of 15th-century courtesans. It was very subtle, very clever. Were we in fact watching the brutalised childhood of nymphomaniac Lucrezia Borgia or the confessional narratives of Silvio Berlusconi's bunga-bunga girls?Boundaries were blurred. Expectations were high. Figgis had evoked much in this opening. Surely the curtain would lift on something extraordinary. It did. The wrong music. The overture had been cut and Lucrezia's entry brought forward. I wouldn't have minded - and neither would have Donizetti - if it had added anything but it didn't. Meanwhile on stage, we received little more than a history lesson: scenery from the 1990s, blocking from the 1970s, costume from the back of the period drawer.Figgis appeared to have ploughed all his imagination (which wan't always the very safest of bets) and attention into the little films. The result was a failure to realise that Donizetti's Lucrezia Borgia is a comedy not a tragedy. Listen to the music and you won't fail to notice that, even by the standards of bel canto, the opera's rum-ti-tum count is high and rarely, if ever, disturbed by clouds of orchestral darkness.The story may read like a taut Freudian thriller, filled with Oedipal tensions as Lucrezia seeks to redeem her mess of a life by bedding her long-lost son, Gennaro, only to find herself resorting to bad habits, murdering Gennaro's five buddies and then Gennaro himself, but the music - and Paul Daniel's cod translation - leads the ear to the land of the Carry On.The increasingly mixed bag of filmed back-storying preludes (a living recreation of a Bronzino painting being one of the highlights; a classically Figgis bit of gratuitous lesbian action being one of many low points), showing a wronged and therefore fruit-loopy young Lucrezia, kept hinting that we were about to encounter a piercing assault on 15th-century patriarchy. No such luck. Something pointless and rum-ti-tum needed to be said first.In the second half, set decisions improved. Peter Mumford's lighting stopped having to try to hide how little scenery there was and began to be able to flatter Es Devlin's dinky sets: a gilt chapel, a Ferrara-filled proscenium arch and a Last Supper tableau that frames the fated Gennaro and friends in the final scene. One last film, which shows Lucrezia receiving a forcible infibulation at the hands of some creepy nuns (their heads in tights) and giving up her son, Gennaro, accompanied by a soft, sighing musical prelude, saw Figgis's film-making at its most powerful. So much so that it upstaged the final reveal.The singing was fine, if safe. Claire Rutter was a powerful, if overly sane, presence in the title role. A delightful flickery tone from Michael Fabiano warmed the cockles. Alastair Miles's was decently Machiavellian as Lucrezia's husband. Elizabeth DeShong's Orsino (usually a travesty role but this time not) was industrious, captivating and clear. Paul Daniel was as clunky in the pit as he was with his pen. The choir was invisible. As, increasingly, seemed the worth of the opera. Rum. Ti.

743,"Rameau's Castor et Pollux, Theater an der Wien",Rameau's Castor et Pollux,Theater an der Wien,2011-01-24,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"For us Ramistes the brilliance came as no surprise. But did the genius come across to the uninitiated? This new production of Castor et Pollux, one of Rameau's finest tragédie en musique, was the Baroque composer's Austrian stage premiere. Would the Theater an der Wien's audience look past the oddities and archaisms and unfamiliarities of Rameau's 300-year-old musical and dramatic language and embrace the radical nature of his leggy recitatives and proto-Romantic ebb and flow? No question. This was the theatre that embraced the premieres of Beethoven's Third and Fifth Symphonies as well as Fidelio. These Viennese know good music when they hear it.They had help. Following on from their superbly perky adaptation of Rameau's opéra comique Platée at the Opéra du Rhin in Strasbourg last year, conductor Christophe Rousset and director Mariame Clément have teamed up again to great effect. Plumping for the later, more dramatic 1756 version of the work - that nonetheless sees the removal of the spectacular prologue and several dances - Rousset and Clément haul proceedings into the 1930s and the grand stairwell of a bourgeois mansion. They scrub it of its static Classical gravity and reveal a fragile, cracked surface full of the emotional toing and froing of a modern family saga.From the beginning, we see a sober, clear directorial purpose. Clément's aim seems modest but wise: to invest the Enlightenment conundrum at its centre (which are stronger: the affairs of the loins or bonds of brotherly love?) with as much psychological realism as the story can take. Everything is focused on summoning up a plausible, kinetic, modern drama as Pollux and Castor's ill-fated love of Télaïre sends them spinning into the gardens of heaven and the confines of hell. Even the ballets, divested of dance, are requisitioned for the effort, and offer a back story that lead us through the brothers' childhood at the feet of Jupiter and Leda. We aren't far from Bergman's Fanny och Alexander with its weddings and funerals and pregnant unease.Sometimes Clément squeezes the myth too hard for psychological ends. The high jinks and spectacle that was crucial to distinguishing the tragédie en musique from its non-musical cousin was a little conspicuous by its absence. I thirsted at times for some dance. I thirsted at times for some flights of fancy such as we were treated to in Emanuel Schikaneder's theatre itself, whose small boxes, each flanked by golden diving Atlantes, magnify the occupants like something from Alice's Wonderland. But drama was to be had. There were several impressive funerary tableaux, reminiscent of the paintings of Poussin and David (see picture above), which punctuated the evening memorably.And the music gained from a tight approach. Rameau is, like Wagner, an ocean-going composer. Vast distances are covered. Extraordinary adventures are faced. Great moral tests are overcome. In Castor et Pollux, for example, Pollux must fetch Castor from hell. These heroic travails are always sweaty musical journeys, built around uniquely leggy recitatives that sail long and lonely distances, rising and breaking, batting back reflections and oily darknesses, like the shattered surface of the sea. None of the intensity of the musical language - its subtlety and contradictions, the way major keys usher in tragedy and minor keys herald sweetness and succour - is wasted by Clément. There was some fine direction of Dietrich Henschel's tested Pollux, Christiane Karg's long-suffering Télaïre and Anne Sofie von Otter's tragic Phébé.The roughness of the ride is as much down to Rousset and his Les Talens Lyrique as Clément. Rousset had a confident edge to his speeds and propulsion. Charm, elegance and equilibrium - which for some would feature more prominently - are eviscerated in these choppy waters. The second act in which we mourn the death of Castor was utterly compelling. Drums and low-lying instruments were given free rein to let rip. Throughout, the bounty of Rameau's orchestration was made the most of.Von Otter was most compelling and impressive as Phébé, especially in the way she tackled the feast of French ornaments. Christiane Karg (Télaïre) had a voice that was quite delightful in all directions and emotions but rarely achieved a convincing French Baroque style. A sound of elegance and dramatic force was Dietrich Henschel's contribution as Pollux. Maxim Mironov's Castor is a tender haute-contre that would have been a perfect foil to Henschel's Pollux if he wasn't so often sharp. Nicolas Testé's Jupiter was resplendently rich and authoritative. Sophie Marilley sang several smaller plot-filling characters sensitively. The Arnold Schoenberg Chor's contribution, though powerful, revealed how tricky it is to navigate Rameau's ornaments cleanly.One can't get away from the archaisms of Rameau's operas, especially the stasis in psychological development that was in keeping with the conventions of the day. Operas aren't left on the shelf for 300 years for no reason. But what this production proves is that, with an intelligent director and committed conductor, they can be overcome. And when it is overcome, Rameau reveals himself to be one of the most extraordinary composers of the 18th century. Well overdue a staging or three in Britain, I'd say.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/rameaus-castor-et-pollux-theater-der-wien,

Trading satire for slapstick, politics for aesthetics, and subversion for celebration, the production is generous in laughs but lingers scarcely longer in the mind than on the lips. With previous alumni including Mark Elder, Joyce DiDonato and Juan Diego Flórez, there are some long shadows looming over the show’s hot-pink horizon, adding a not unwelcome sense of edginess to this latest revival – an edginess entirely absent from the production itself.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/il-barbiere-di-siviglia-royal-opera,
745,"Carmen, Opera North",Carmen,Opera North,2011-01-17,graham Rickson,"“If you’re not careful, the opening act could become a costume parade: there are the townspeople, the children, the guards, the factory women – up to 350 people on stage in 20 minutes, before Carmen even enters, singing a catchy jingle from a recent TV advert.” So wrote director Daniel Kramer in last week’s Guardian. This may fill Carmen fans with nervous apprehension, but none should be felt, as this production is one of the most visually spectacular and exciting things I’ve seen.Not all the directorial decisions work equally well, but we’ll get to one of those later. Bizet’s score has been trimmed slightly and we don’t get all the dialogue, but the cuts mean that the evening flies by in cinematic fashion. This is a French composer’s account of a Spanish story, so the fact that Kramer's setting is now Seville, Ohio, doesn’t jar in the slightest.“Blow in her face and she’ll follow you anywhere”, states the delicious 1960s pastiche cigarette advertisement hoarding shown before the curtain rises, and Soutra Gilmour’s detailed set presents us with a faux-American town square, the guards now policemen throwing basketballs. There’s still a sense of heat, sweat and violence, softened by the depiction of Bizet’s guards as overgrown Boy Scouts. Their grotesque harassment of Anne Sophie Duprels’s Micaela is still stomach-churning, but in general the male characters seem feeble and immature, contrasting with Heather Shipp’s vibrant Carmen.Shipp is a wonderful actress, completely in thrall to Kramer’s conception of the piece. How can she be attracted to Peter Auty’s José – clumsy, chubby and wearing ridiculous shorts? It helps that his voice is so alluring.The love scene together in Act Two sounds marvellous, even as we laugh when José decides to return to duty rather than consummate his love for Carmen. Here, Kramer’s conception of a town dance is an insanely choreographed party in a trailer park, pinyada dangling from a tree and drunken locals shuffling around. Kostas Smoriginas’s matador Escamillo is wonderfully seedy, swaggering around with a bull terrier on a chain – do watch what he does with a bottle of tomato ketchup.All this may give the impression that Opera North’s production is a piece of vapid sensationalism. It isn’t. It’s supremely well cast and is impressively conducted by Andreas Delfs, never letting his orchestra overwhelm the vocals. It’s wonderfully designed and beautifully lit; witness Act Three’s dark forest, and how the colour scheme darkens as the opera progresses.The townsfolk of Seville are literally roaring for blood, and it’s chilling to see them now dressed in black and red. This is superb, edgy stuff. How reassuring to see an opera company staging something bold and exciting instead of dusting off a safe revival. Keel Watson’s Zuniga is excellent, and the chorus are superb. But can someone explain to me what was going on with the elderly folk in Act One, whose significance still eludes me?",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/carmen-opera-north,
746,"Hänsel und Gretel, Royal Opera",Hänsel und Gretel,Royal Opera,2010-12-24,ismene Brown,"Fairy tales are fear tales really, the sweetening (and sharpening) of every child’s worst nightmares, emotions long buried in adulthood but very easily tapped back into with good theatre productions. The Witch in Hansel and Gretel should be the queen of the team of the ogres who lurk in forests or homes waiting to kill children, along with lieutenants the Wolf in Red Riding Hood, Snow White’s wicked stepmother and Carabosse in The Sleeping Beauty. Last night’s opening of the Royal Opera’s revival of its jaunty 2008 production fielded in a splendid cast a tremendous Witch, Jane Henschel, the size of a ship in a cardigan, and with a voice that can still make the lulled auditorium jump.Henschel has the right combination of a Wagnerian cackle and lascivious dimples to be able to say, “I am Rosina Sweet-Tooth and I am as friendly and innocent as baby,” and for just a second make it credible. But then she turns around and you see her long tangled grey hair has a bloody streak down the back, the titanic body is squeezed into a fishtail tweed skirt. Next thing we’re in a kitchen the size of Valhalla, two gigantic ovens, and a butcher block the better to chop up the contents of her huge chiller with. And I won’t say what’s in that, because it is a good coup de théâtre.The American mezzo is only one of the many pleasures in this revival of Moshe Leiser and Patrice Caurier’s 2008 production of Engelbert Humperdinck’s delectable 1893 opera, led by Thomas Allen as the father and the brilliantly cast siblings of Ailish Tynan and Christine Rice. They make a deliciously tubby, well-fed pair of middle-class suburban schoolchildren, absolutely obsessed with hunger, sneaking about for food, dreaming of it, and the fact that they’re relishably fatty morsels is all the more in keeping with the Witch’s lipsmacking when she sees them.Tynan is a wholesome little star, a very short, square-faced blonde with daffy rolling eyes and chubby legs, and a winning bolshiness when cornered by the Witch; her voice has a caramel lustre in its lower range that adds a haunting undertow to a top that is pure sugary magic - her song in the forest about the one-legged man was irresistibly charming (pictured right). Rice towers over her, very boyish, gawky and bossy, and their voices mesh perfectly under the swiftly responsive and picturesque conducting of Rory Macdonald, emphasising the feminine fragrance of much of this gorgeous music (unsurprising that Richard Strauss was its first conductor in 1893).The styling is like a children's book, flat scissored sets, with a sharply wonky bedroom for the children (picture of ballerina on wall for Gretel), a forest like a layered collage of photographs (lovely, outdoorsy) and a Witch’s kitchen the Aga country set would die for. It feels Forties-ish and mittelEuropean. Allen swaggers around the children’s tiny bedroom with his beer bottle and Spar groceries, vocally ideal and leering tipsily at Yvonne Howard as his wife as they start some rumpypumpy on Hansel’s bed (pictured below left), before collecting themselves. I don’t think the bedroom setting works with the libretto (parents don’t make their kids’ bedroom the venue for their own sexplay - that’s another fairy tale, surely?), but its deceptive cosiness suits the Grimm Brothers’ deliberate softening of the original fable’s frightening interchange of mother and witch.Deceptive, because this modernised context does highlight a new moral - that it’s greed that got the kids into the near-lethal scrape. No darkness clouds the tale thanks to much benevolence inserted by Humperdinck’s librettist, his sister, to ensure a light-hearted family evening. The kind Sandman and Dew Fairy offer two lovely sung episodes and the chance here for two fairyland costumes that tear away the drabness imposed by the family’s condition: the Sandman with the illusion of a tiny dwarf body, the Dew Fairy a perfect Barbie princess in pink, wielding green Marigolds and an orange duster to sweep up mess and put all in order (Anna Devin particularly feisty as the latter, making a last-minute substitution for the ill Anna Siminska). The children’s sleep is tranquil, the chance for Leiser and Caurier to stage a solemnly affecting Christmas dream for them, and the Witch doesn’t detain the happy ending too long. Highly recommended for very sweet dreams.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/h%C3%A4nsel-und-gretel-royal-opera,
747,"Bellérophon in Concert, Les Talens Lyriques, Rousset, Versailles",Bellérophon in Concert,Les Talens Lyriques,2010-12-19,David Nice,"In fact it was the Namur Chamber Choir which had the lion's share of the most striking music, transcending pretty hymns of celebration to conjure up for us the dark magicians who create the tripartite chimera, striking haut-contre tenors crowning their sombre harmonies, and then the fearful people of monster-ravaged Lycia. For these alone Rousset deserves the royal crown for resurrecting a score that disappeared from sight after 1773, its last court flourish following the 1679 premiere in the Academie Royale de Musique. It's not just the similarities with the myth of Idomeneo that made me wonder whether Mozart could possibly at least have seen the score of Bellerophon, for it's nothing less than his admittedly greater ceremonies which Lully's Acts Three and Four evoke. Rousset confessed his surprise when he laid his hands on the printed edition (pictured above), a love at first sight which gave rise to the first performance ""in modern times"", as they say, at this year's Beaune Festival and now at Versailles.Rousset's elegant but never brittle approach, slipping into lilting metres without fuss, phrasing beautifully and seeing to all the varied dynamics, kept our interest stoked (no mean achievement in my case, as I'd risen at 4.30am for the flight to Paris, but never nodded once). It all projected effortlessly in the glorious wooden theatre right to the back of the king's box. The five basses de violon kept the foundations powerful but sprightly; oboes doubled stylishly with violins and Marie-Ange Petit wielded an exotic array of percussion to freshen up the Bacchic and Eastern dances. If vocally the ensemble was less perfect, three of the four leads kept us engaged. Ingrid Perruche regally dominated as Sténobée, the imperious queen whose original role in the myth as a kind of Potiphar's wife is beefed up by her jealousy of Bellérophon's beloved Philinoe (a more than usually wet and weedy ingénue as rather palely sung by Céline Scheen). After an afternoon tour of the Opéra Royal conducted in a French that didn't communicate to me, it was a joy to hear the language make absolute sense in Perruche's expressively gestured recitatives (true, there isn't much more to Sténobée than ""helas"" followed by ""vengeance"").If the men weren't quite on that Bernhardtesque level, both the hero and the villain riveted attention. Cyril Auvity communicated passion and frustration as an engaging Bellérophon, his edgy and dangerous tenor always kept just in check. And though no true bass, Jean Teitgen was cuttingly authoritative both as Apollo (homaging the roi soleil as expected in the Prologue) and magus Amisodar. Several of the minor roles jerked their bodies around to compensate for slight vocal gifts, but there was pleasure in another, lighter tenor, Robert Getchell, and the quartet anticipating the conflict with the chimera.Though only giving the opera in concert, Les Talens Lyriques made rich amends by picturing the action out in the auditorium and by skillfully ringing the changes on the lighting of a splendid old Versailles set as backdrop. And so something of the splendour which must have attended the opening of the Théatre Royal (pictured above) for the wedding of the Dauphin, soon to be the ill-fated Louis XVI, and Marie Antoinette with a performance of Lully's Persée, illuminated all of us. Very well, so I'm of peasant Huguenot stock and something of the revolutionary in me stirred on the earlier tour. But I came out of the royal enclave on the wintriest of Friday nights treading airily on the snow of the huge Versailles courtyard.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/bell%C3%A9rophon-concert-les-talens-lyriques-rousset-versailles,
748,"Tannhäuser, Royal Opera",Tannhäuser,Royal Opera,2010-12-12,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"The double standards in opera are amazing. If heldentenor Johan Botha - a man the size of a small Eastern European country - had been a woman, he would have been refused re-entry to the stage till he'd had a gastric band fitted. But his size was the least of our worries. For those of us who vainly cling to the idea of opera as a viable dramatic art form, Botha's return to Covent Garden as Tannhäuser was one of the most profoundly depressing experiences of my life.For most of the first two acts Botha might as well have been a stuffed bear on wheels. He paced from stage right to stage left to stage right with so few discernible human qualities I thought he might be Susan Boyle. All of which should have been set at naught. Irrelevant. Beneath the concerns of a critic - as I'm sure you'll all speedily point out. Botha is after all, first and foremost, a singer. It is with his voice that he should indicate and carve out presence, character and movement. It is with his voice that he can transcend - as so many have - physical awkwardness and oddity. It is with the voice that opera becomes a viable dramatic art form. And it was with his voice that the good ship HMS Botha ultimately grounded itself.Was there something wrong? Technically speaking nothing seemed awry. He had all the huff and puff - and by golly, does one need a lot of huff and puff for this role - required to sustain the performance. Yet the translation of this huffing and puffing into emotion or storytelling was so pronounced by its absence that one started to think there must be something up. Too much control was my conclusion as to what was up. The valve to his soul had been sealed shut.So with Botha on the bench for much of the game this production was always going to be more than a little lame. A Tannhäuser without Tannhäuser is a bit like a house without a door. Access is tricky. So we tried a few windows. The easiest way in normally is through the Venusberg, which last night was the Royal Opera House. Quite literally. Director Tim Albery had replicated the Royal Opera House's proscenium arch, stage and curtain behind the proscenium arch, stage and curtain. Here, on the stage that lay on stage the debauchery began. Thrillingly choreographed by Jasmin Vardimon, poshly dressed dancers flung their bodies - and the chairs and table - in back-breaking wave-like shapes, deconstructing their refined reality, mirroring the sexual flipping and flopping of the musical start. It was the highlight of an overly conceptual and incoherent production.Michaela Schuster's Venus couldn't quite match up to the seductions of the dancers, though she tried her best. It isn't easy I imagine trying to seduce a supporting wall. Or was that Botha? Difficult to tell. Many of us hoped that Eva-Maria Westbroek's Elisabeth would be the one to open up the opera. And to an extent she did. She filled out her character as much as Botha thinned his so that we got far more than the pitiable cipher that Wagner's drama offers up on paper. In a way her irreproachably fair, virtuous and humane qualities are so much more attractive than the suburban seductions of Schuster's Venus that there's not much of a dramatic contest for Botha's Tannhäuser.So our search for an entry to the soul of this work - I felt like Parsifal, I did - continued. Few of the Minnesingers - Tannhäuser's fellow warrior-artists - shone very brightly. But then came Christian Gerhaher's Wolfram von Eschinbach (pictured right with Westbroek's Elisabeth). In him, one had a soulmate, someone to admire and believe in and cry for, and a voice - gauzy, flickering, Lieder-like in sensitivity - that always teetered beguilingly on the cusp of a speaking voice. Modesty, selflessness and unrequited love are his lot. Gerhaher delivered his overshadowed but important story - he is a John the Baptist figure to Elisabeth's Jesus - with immense subtlety and quiet power. His ""Song to the Evening Star"" was shattering.Gerhaher's contribution wouldn't have been enough, however, to carry the whole four-and-a-half-hour evening. For this one relied on a hero in the pit, conductor Semyon Bychkov. The energy, the honesty, the flexibility of his instructions would have been enough. But he was also drawing the most divine beauty from each and every musician. Each break-away solo or chamber-like melodising from the clarinet, violin, cello, horns or the flutter-tonguing flutes glistened with unalloyed joy. It reminded us that beneath all the musical fanfare of Wagner is a great miniaturist. Some of the most captivating moments of the evening came from Wagner's frequent retreat into small forces, especially those that accompany Gerhaher.The musicality of Bychkov, Gerhaher and Westbroek and the now rousing, now stilled choir more than made up for the work's dramatic limitations. On which subject, ladies and gents, time for some plain-speaking. Early Wagner it may be but as a play Tannhäuser is still unforgivably embarrassing: unidirectional in its thrust, clunking in its exposition of Christian catechism - read Pope Benedict XVI's excellent encyclical Deus Caritas Est for an infinitely more sophisticated (and arguably more dramatic) take on the same dilemma - and horribly stilted in its unravelling. And you won't even begin to be able to iron out these mammoth creases if you start with a dalek as your leading man.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/tannh%C3%A4user-royal-opera,

752,"A Dog's Heart, English National Opera",A Dog's Heart,English National Opera,2010-11-21,David Nice,"For make no mistake, A Dog's Heart at the Coliseum is the full music-theatre package, an apogee of what the company has been striving for in its recent co-option of video projection and complementary theatrical disciplines - here led by Complicite's ever-ingenious Simon McBurney.Having spent some time with Russian Raskatov's score, and a recording of the June 2010 Amsterdam premiere, I'd had a few concerns. One ever so faintly lingers: that the composer and his librettist, Cesare Mazzonis, shouldn't have tried to accommodate all the incidents of Bulgakov's terse two-part fiction about a stray mutt taken in by a Doctor Frankenstein of a large Moscow apartment and turned, by means of implanting body parts from an old drunk, into a proletarian nightmare. Prokofiev or Shostakovich, had they been permitted access to the master writer's early satire (it was only published in 1987), might have set it more selectively. But here, despite cuts, the pace occasionally falters, despite Martin Pickard's racy translation of the Russian original.That said, Raskatov packs in material enough for a dozen new operas. He follows his chief master, Schnittke, in touching on a wealth of references including Bach, Wagner, Soviet mass songs and Russian liturgical music, as well as what Schnittke used to call ""pseudo quotations"". But would the disciple's brew mix as well as Schnittke's ""polystylism""? It did last night, chiefly thanks to the marvellous Garry Walker's razor-sharp conducting and a vocal team reaching out to the bounds of the possible that Raskatov's awkward, all-over-the-shop writing for them demands: both, simply in terms of musical execution, streets ahead of what I heard on the Amsterdam recording.But this is, above all, often visionary theatre that ought to beguile newcomers to ENO. Finn Ross's video projections hook us from the first multilayered snowstorm to the various agitprop banners, archival crowd scenes and Muybridgesque sequences of running dogs and men; the set designs, by Michael Levine and Luis Carvalho, centre around a simple but brilliant evocation of the smug doctor's over-large central apartment room, elaborate chandelier rampant. There are rivers of blood which flow off the hydraulic stage, and a rather scary overflow when the man-dog gets trapped in the bathroom with a cat he's persecuting.Within these confines - and in the mounting proletarian menace on the fringes - Complicite's McBurney, directing his first opera, matches the collage fabrics of Raskatov's score with plenty of action but never too much stage mess. Our sympathies are engaged by the victim. First it's a skeletalised Giacometti mutt, brilliantly steered by Mark Down and his fellow puppeteers from Blind Summit Theatre. I didn't much care for their puppet-child in the wildly overrated Minghella production of Madam Butterfly, though granted, the art when skilfully done makes the figure live. And here it did so in a much more convincing context.Dog Sharik rolled his black eyes appealingly, attacked and rolled over exactly as a wild dog might. Inevitably the much simpler cat puppets his semi-human self eventually stalks almost stole the show: how Bulgakov, creator of the unforgettable feline in The Master and Margherita as well as the moggy who tears the curtains in the theatre-novel Black Snow, would have laughed. But Sharik has a soul, too, split between the megaphoned vocal acrobatics of Raskatov's wife, Elena Vassilieva, and the more poetic soul of Andrew Watts - the most clarion and persuasive countertenor in the business, as his previous appearances in ENO's Le Grand Macabre and the rather thankless outer wastes of Schnittke's Faust opera in semi-staged performance have already revealed.Yet there's no lowering of interest when surgery turns the dog into Peter Hoare's Polygraph Polygraphovich Sharikov, stipulated by Raskatov as a ""tenore coloratura buffo"" - in other words, the embodiment of Gogol's petty official Nose in Shostakovich's genius black comedy, but with humanity. And Hoare so touches with his Sharikov's awkward dog-like movements and weird appearance that we quickly feel sorry for a creation who only does what his human and canine components have programmed him to do.Sharikov's antics set the drama careering, and many in the audience thought they were getting a much livelier second act - though in fact Raskatov often recapitulates elements from the first, and McBurney honours the symmetries. There's no doubt, though, that the cameos wheeled on to demonstrate Professor Preobrazhensky's domestic and professional worlds in Act One, vividly stylised from Nancy Allen Lundy's yapping, caricatural maid to Frances McCafferty's knicker-dropping, lustful old lady, stop us from getting to the point. On the other hand the havoc wrought by his man-dog brings Steven Page's Professor to the brink of madness in a drinking scene with his assistant Bormenthal (Leigh Melrose). At last the flippertigibbet musical language settles to a ground bass and then a mournful repeated rhythm as the consequences begin to kick in. Page, in his second committed assumption of a tricky contemporary-opera role this year, has a bit of trouble with Raskatov's insane ranginess but carries off the pompous authority of the days-are-numbered doctor with his usual aplomb.The operations are suitably gruesome and won't be viewed by the squeamish, even though the first begins in mesmerising silhouette - and here, too, in both climactic actions, Walker screws Raskatov's music to the sticking-point far more compellingly than it had been at the premiere. Laughs? Yes, there are quite a few, especially when the cats go up the wall. But very often they die on our lips. That's the prerogative of great satire: it's what Bulgakov's genius is all about.

753,"Ariadne auf Naxos, Welsh National Opera",Ariadne auf Naxos,Welsh National Opera,2010-10-08,stephen Walsh,"Ariadne auf Naxos, according to its librettist Hugo von Hofmannsthal, is all about fidelity: fidelity in love, fidelity in art, fidelity in spirit. Ariadne on her island, abandoned by Theseus, can give herself to Bacchus only by persuading herself that he’s a god. The actress Zerbinetta gives herself to every man in sight, including the Composer (played, incidentally, by a girl), who for a moment weakens in his lofty contempt for these comic actors who intrude on his high ideals with their vulgar songs and dubious humour.Hofmannsthal could seldom be parted from his deep meanings. All the same the real interest of Strauss’s chamber opera – composed just after Der Rosenkavalier – lies in its theatrical method, which, pre-Pirandello, pre-Turandot, presents an earnest, heroic drama disrupted by irrelevant characters who offer advice to the heroine and do their best to turn the opera seria into street theatre. It’s an entertaining, suggestive idea, but problematic in performance, partly because Strauss couldn’t bring himself to abandon his epic conclusion, which tends to drag on and in the process rather spoils the irony. The finest music comes in the Prologue, backstage before the show, which has the performers popping in and out of their dressing rooms in the best Feydeau manner while the high-minded young Composer laments the looming wreckage of his magnum opus.This is also much the most enjoyable part of Neil Armfield’s production in this WNO revival at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff. True, he drops Hofmannstal’s beloved 18th century, and with it the whole idea of the grand Viennese palais (which survives nevertheless in the text). Still, Dale Ferguson’s modern theatre-backstage fizzes and crackles with comic vitality while allowing space for those moments where the music speaks, the comedy retreats, Zerbinetta looks into the Composer’s eyes and for about 30 seconds falls in love. Sarah Connolly, in the travesty role of the Composer, is wonderfully touching in these episodes, and Gillian Keith (pictured right with a suited Connolly) as Zerbinetta subtly colours her flirtatiousness with the sort of profundity that lurks in the eyes and voices of pretty girls but vanishes in an “Augenblick”, as she admits – the flash of a spider’s eye.There are several other crisp performances in the prologue from singers who, like the Composer, are not required in the “opera” itself. Stephen Rooke’s Dancing Master is outstanding – a fine lyric tenor; but Robert Poulton’s shock-haired Music Master, and the just-not-too-overacted Major Domo of Eric Roberts (another disruptive element, as the part is spoken) are also both excellent. As for those who do reappear on Ariadne’s island, the four commedia masks (Owen Webb, Aled Hall, Julian Close and Wynne Evans) make a sprightly team, but as always they outstay their welcome, a problem that not all Armfield’s skilful management of slapstick cliché can solve. Strauss even made the mistake of continuing Zerbinetta’s great show-stopping aria ""Grossmächtige Prinzessin""  for some minutes after it’s stopped the show – to my mind a fatal miscalculation. Keith dispatches the whole thing with coquettish brilliance. But one nevertheless tends to sympathise with Ariadne (Orla Boylan), who has had enough long before the end and makes a dignified exit.Would that she could manage her own music with quite such poise. She is, though, a wooden actress, and her musical phrasing is short-winded; there is bloom – of a silvery kind - on the voice, but rarely on the long musical line. She might take a tip from her three graces, Mary-Jean O’Doherty, Patricia Orr and Joanne Boag, who blend with irresistible sweetness in the march-trio they cheekily base on Harlequin’s “Lieben, Hassen, Hoffen, Zagen”. But Strauss did not make it easy for her, or indeed for her “new god”, Bacchus (Ricardo Tamura), who descends in this production on a superior builder’s cradle and acts, it must be said, like a superior builder. His singing, though, is better than that: sturdy, if one-toned. But the problems of this conclusion are mainly Strauss’s fault. Perhaps we should revert to the work’s earlier ending, which has the masks reappearing and M Jourdain falling asleep in his box.Finally, I’m happy to report that, after last month’s lamentable Fidelio, Lothar Koenigs and the WNO Orchestra are back on top form. They need to be. Strauss’s chamber textures are exposed and the balance treacherous, but everything here is stylish, athletic and beautiful, in an opera that is almost worth hearing for its orchestration alone. OVERLEAF: MORE RICHARD STRAUSS ON THEARTSDESK",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/ariadne-auf-naxos-welsh-national-opera,
754,"Radamisto, English National Opera",Radamisto,English National Opera,2010-10-08,alexandra Coghlan,"If interior décor could shout, then last night’s music might have proved altogether incidental. The curtain rises to reveal a set gift-wrapped – ramparts, city walls and all – in the brightest of hot-pink damasks: a Nicky Haslam acid trip. Ladies and gentlemen, we are now entering operatic Orient 2.0, a sexy, postmodern take on the original you know and love, complete with an oversized menagerie of animals, evil tyrants and exotic princesses.It’s a familiar enough concept for Handel at ENO, wilful exaggeration, calculated anachronisms and all, and as we progress it is the large-scale simplicity of Gideon Davey’s set rather than the fussiness of Alden’s direction that proves most effective.The plot, predictably, is convoluted and fairly incidental, setting ambitious Armenian despot Tiridate against elderly king of Thrace, Farasmane. That Tiridate’s wife Polissena should be the daughter of Farasmane, and her husband obsessed with sister-in-law Zenobia (wife of Thracian prince Radamisto, Polissena’s brother), adds to the incestuous complexity of proceedings, but never materially threatens the inevitable lieto fine.Shunning a period band in favour of the ENO in-house orchestra, we got off to a swaggering, stylish start under the direction of Laurence Cummings. Sadly the promise of the overture was never subsequently fulfilled, with the orchestra proving the heavy-footed peasant at the ball, making one long for the sway and lilt of Concert d’Astrée or Les Arts Florissants. The gorgeous playing of the oboes, and a star turn from a pair of horns, however, did much to compensate for the wayward strings, with the oboe obbligato for Zenobia’s “When O when, will cruel Fortune” a particular delight.Fielding a young, largely British cast who are vocally everything that the Royal Opera House’s international Tamerlano stars failed so spectacularly to be, the evening’s singing was superb. Sophie Bevan’s creamy soprano (pictured right) promises so much for the future, and delivered stylishly as put-upon Polissena. Set against veteran Christine Rice’s Zenobia (beautifully sung as ever, but dramatically rather blank) and Lawrence Zazzo’s agile Radamisto, Bevan emerged their equal – no small feat.Bass Ryan McKinny’s Tiridate was all hollow laughs, dodgy facial hair and rich tone, but his urgency and tendency to rush denied the role the full relish it clearly deserves. Rounding out the cast were Henry Waddington’s underused Farasmane and Ailish Tynan, unrecognisable as the stout, fez-sporting, brow-mopping Armenian aide Tigrane. The most assured dramatic performance of the evening, she – along with most of the cast – suffered from a tendency to over-egg the da capos, overloading them with stratospheric ornamentation that didn’t always quite come off. Combined with Alden’s rather hysterical direction (emotive caressing of walls and rolling across the floor featured largely) the effect was unbalanced, risking the integrity of the drama.Though not quite approaching the dramatic quality of other Handel-Haym collaborations (Giulio Cesare, Rodelinda), Radamisto is a serviceable opera seria with more than its fair share of big tunes, and deserves its day in the sun. Alden and his team have clearly had a ball with it, delighting in excess and exoticism (complete with fire-breathing dragon and cheeky visual reference to Burton/Taylor classic Cleopatra); if they avoid making any real interpretational decisions or coming to any terribly substantial conclusions, then it scarcely seems to matter.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/radamisto-english-national-opera,

757,"Sellars and Viola's Tristan und Isolde, Royal Festival Hall",Sellars and Viola's Tristan und Isolde,Royal Festival Hall,2010-09-26,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"People always overlook how much of a hippie Richard Wagner was intellectually. His philosophical stance differs little from that of Neil from The Young Ones. It's a side of Wagner you can't get away from in Tristan und Isolde, with its endless railing against temporal realities and its search for universal oneness - yeah man, oneness. And it was doubly impossible to avoid these stoner-like thoughts last night at the Philharmonia Orchestra's Royal Festival Hall performance, where Bill Viola's videos - a typically elemental smorgasbord, with Adam and Eve types dressed in nappies - offered up what, at times, looked like home videos from Waco.But if some of the video fell on the wrong side of the New Age line, and other parts of it fell a bit too chicly on the wrong side of the fashion-ad line, most of it, say 90 per cent, had a terrific aesthetic substance. Viola is a great film technician. So images of sea, woods, dawns, ships, couples are never just that. However close he comes to cliché, he just manages to tack away at the last minute. Images are bled, over-exposed, slowed down or pixilated. Like the ill-fated couple, there is never a comfortable middle way. Texture, colour, light, even the screen (which is flipped portrait-wise for the final act) are all carefully manipulated.All of which surprised me. I've always been, at best, underwhelmed, at worst, angered by Viola's gallery work. And yet this potpourri accompanying Tristan - with plenty of fire and water, slow-motioning, close-ups and a few tears - is little more than a greatest-hits DVD of this gallery work. But somehow the lack in these images when viewed on their own vanishes when in conversation with Tristan. In fact, in the many magical images of the sea, of the deepest recesses of woods, of one of those mighty modern ships on a dark horizon, one often got to a more profound, more haunting truth than one would have ever got from just listening to the didactic teenage sentiments of the libretto, whose brazenly immoral death fixation still rather offends my sensibilities.It certainly provided a perfect template for future multimedia collaborations. As did the ideas from Peter Sellars provide a perfect template for future semi-stagers, with its full utilisation of every last nook and cranny of the HMS Royal Festival Hall. I have never felt more like I was on a ship in a performance of Tristan. Joshua Ellicott's Sailor lets out his opening sighs high up from a box as if up a mast; the choir strikes up their stentorian voices from behind and above as if on deck. The surround sound creates a oneness of sorts. Esa-Pekka Salonen had to conduct in the round.He did it well. The Philharmonia Orchestra never once let him down. It was a lustrous sound they produced together, one that wasn't just exciting but also delicate. There was restraint where necessary, so that the more intimate events shone. Both leads, Violeta Urmana's Isolde and Gary Lehman's Tristan, shone, too. Urmana is a classy act: still, concentrated, powerful, unwavering in quality and tone to the end. By Act Three, Lehman had run out of the quality puff that had been so evident at the start, and in his death throes adopted a comically gormless face. Matthew Best's King Marke was astoundingly fine, Anne Sofie von Otter's Brangäne less so, over-agitated in manner and mouth.But this production (which was fully staged in Paris in 2005) sees video collaboration come of age. In dramatic conception and in co-ordination with the plot, two or three of Viola's ideas were quite literally breathtaking. The final levitation was perhaps the most extraordinary of the lot. There is a pretentiousness in Viola's images, for sure, and at times a nauseating obsession with New Age symbolism. But none of it is any worse than the pretentiousness of the libretto. And anything that deflects our attention from the pretentious immoralities of the libretto and elevates the situation to a plane in which you can relate to the characters and the basic concepts hidden amid the philisophical grand-standing is a good thing in my book.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/sellars-and-violas-tristan-und-isolde-royal-festival-hall,

Director Des McAnuff's attempt to marshal this melodrama into revealing truths about Nazism, war crimes and the morality of modern science was always going to be a bit ambitious.Gounod's Faust is many things: vaudeville act, sentimental romance, Gothic tragedy, Catholic catechism, in short, a wholly unrealistic but winningly schizophrenic work that should be taken about as seriously as an episode of Sunset Beach. Director Des McAnuff's attempt to marshal this melodrama into revealing truths about Nazism, war crimes and the morality of modern science was always going to be a bit ambitious.But as well as being ambitious, it was also more than a little tasteless. That it wasn't a lot tasteless was down to the slipperiness of Faust's identity. McAnuff's Faust is seemingly a Nazi, a scientist working in the shadow of a blitzed Reichstag, about to make the final suicidal sacrifice.Unedifying, particularly as the opera lurched from grand opening statements to sentimental romance. Were we really meant to be absorbing the flutters of the heart of a Joseph Mengele? I hoped not and instead clung (as the clues started to hint in this direction) to the not much more savoury idea that we were instead following a nuclear physicist Faust, one who had fled Berlin and had joined the Manhattan Project. But oddities remained. Why the playing around with beakers? Who knows?Bafflement resulted from McAnuff's breathless attempt to wed everything to an incoherent historic or scientific reality. Focus came briefly in Act Four with the arrival of a dirty, disabled, shell-shocked and incomplete regiment of German soldiers from the front of the First World War (the context of Faust's youth, to which he returns after his pact with Mephistopheles) singing the Soldier's Chorus. It movingly hollowed out the pomp of those famous martial oom-pahs to see a troop of damaged minds and bodies bellow this anthem.But here I felt one could espy the source of McAnuff's downfall. This act's tragedies (all rather disjointed it has to be said) seem to have been his starting point. The rest of the opera (much of which is conceived in a completely different tone) appeared to be adapted to fit with this act's darkness. Consequently the fragrance of the first three acts was all but expunged - though, to be honest, very little of interest or sweetness or life was ever likely to grow from Robert Brill's leaden sets of stultifying functionality and unsightliness.However, it was worth making a Faustian pact with McAnuff's production if only for the music-making, all of which was very fine. Toby Spence's strong, thick voice held the course wonderfully as Faust, right to the bitter, beltering final trio. And for a character that was so weakly directed, he engaged us remarkably well (pictured above right with Iain Patterson).Iain Patterson's Mephistopheles was certainly present vocally if a little absent in character. Anna Grevelius's Act Three aria as the puppyish Siebel sparkled. Melody Moore's vocal contribution as Marguerite (pictured left) - more comfortable as the put-upon mother than the coquette - was darker-hued but no less attractive. Benedict Nelson's Valentin flowered after a flat opening. Conductor Edward Gardner didn't do much with the orchestra except what was needed of them.It's something McAnuff might have heeded: less is more. Cleverness is not rewarded in Faust. One simply needs to make peace with the jarring incongruities of this opera, and indulge the helter-skeltering melodramatic mammon.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/faust-english-national-opera,
761,"Fidelio, Welsh National Opera, Cardiff",Fidelio,Welsh National Opera,2010-09-18,stephen Walsh,"In fact Giuseppe Frigeni’s production and sets have already been seen in Bordeaux, so perhaps it’s more that the novelty by now has worn off. Either way, it’s a miserable affair, devoid of movement or dramatic tension, obscure in its characterisation and motivation, poorly lit and self-evidently costumed not just for a different cast, but for a different race of men and women.It has some of the worst singing I’ve encountered on the professional stage for many a year; and where the singing is good, it mostly comes from the wrong kind of vocal chords. In Meistersinger the orchestra played like well-drilled angels for their music director, Lothar Koenigs; here for him they play like a pick-up band of goodish players. Even the WNO chorus is something less than wonderful, an extremely rare event.What has gone wrong? It’s always hard to pin down the cause of these occasional disasters (and of course they happen to every company at one time or another). But this show reeks of under-preparation and lack of direction. The very first bars of the overture on the first night sounded coarse and untidy, and though matters improved, the playing remained patchy with a few highlights, notably some lovely oboe work in Act Two.Behind the overture Frigeni offers the now inevitable dumb-show of “explanation” in which what one takes to be the main characters drift around gesturing to one another, coming and going, in an utterly babyish, unhelpful, and above all (because it’s a very undramatic overture) musically inapt fashion. A huge steel cage swivels round then settles beside an elegant rococo doorway: the production’s insignia, such as they are – the cause and the effect.When the non-existent curtain rises, the same idiom persists. The singers circle round each other more or less irrelevantly, and much of the action proceeds as a kind of mime, since Frigeni drops most of the dialogue, and what takes place seems completely unmotivated in any real sense. The canon quartet is given no spoken context at all, and when Leonore and Marzelline join hands at the end it’s as if they were enacting some impenetrable ritual, and one half-expects a Tippett-like magus figure to appear in a white cloak.The prisoners are let out into the yard for no known reason. In the dungeon scene, Rocco and Leonore pretend to be in danger from some cavernous menace that Frigeni forgot to design; then suddenly aren’t any more. Of personal electricity between them and Florestan there is little or none. Timing, placing, chemistry: all practically zero.Some of the blame lies with Amélie Haas’s costumes, some with the singers themselves. Whoever originally wore Leonore’s grey suit, I’ll wager she wasn’t Lisa Milne’s shape; it’s idle to pretend such things are unimportant, because opera is after all theatre, and theatre is a visual medium. Milne is a lovely singer, but she is no Leonore, at least not yet. She lacks weight in the lower voice, while the top is that of a Susanna or a Micaëla, both parts that she has sung with success.Dennis O’Neill, a great singer for this company in the past, should please retire with a knighthood. His Florestan is simply not viable: forced and approximate, with poor German and an appearance one can only describe as that of an ageing tenor. Unkind? Thousands of punters are paying big money to see and hear him. They deserve better.Of the rest, Elizabeth Donovan’s Marzelline is the one bit of casting that both looks and sounds right. Her opening duet with Jaquino (Robin Tritschler) and her song are charming, though marred by the drifting and the dumbshow. Clive Bayley makes an interesting attempt to hit off Rocco’s horse-sense humanity, but spoils it by snapping at the notes. Robert Hayward’s Pizarro, a fine, villainous SS colonel, barks his part with such ferocity that the notes almost vanish. Quentin Hayes’s Don Fernando is upstaged and barely audible.At the helm of all this, Koenigs’s role is mysterious. There is energy in his conducting, but of a brusque, unsubtle kind. Occasional beauties emerge like memories of something lost. But as a whole Beethoven’s great score is wretchedly served, and his drama – naïve, improbable, intractable but when done right overwhelming – goes rapidly down the cistern.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/fidelio-welsh-national-opera-cardiff,

764,"Don Pasquale, Royal Opera",Don Pasquale,Royal Opera,2010-09-13,David Nice,"Anticipating revivals of productions that were hardly vivacious in the first place, you can always find reasons to hope. Perhaps there'll be a dazzling house debut. Maybe someone, preferably the revival director, will bring a more focused individual zest to the kind of rough character sketches Jonathan Miller leaves flailing around his beautifully conceived historic locales. Not on this occasion. Singing and conducting were never less than accomplished, but only half-hearted titters from a sparse audience greeted the inhabitants of Miller's opera buffa toytown - more dullsville than doll's house.So this won't take long - unlike Donizetti's romantic comedy, which can seem interminable if its post-Rossinian brio isn't spruced up and buoyantly focused. Once you've looked around the six rooms and staircase of Isabella Bywater's model merchant's house, finely detailed and crisply lit by Jvan Morandi, you wait patiently for the plot to start rollicking. Sir Jonathan has always been able to talk about these kinds of commedia dell'arte characters - silly old man, scheming young lovers, resourceful intermediary - and he did bring them to life in his long-serving ENO production of Rossini's Barber of Seville. But here revival director Daniel Dooner is just left to go through the motions.Ageing bachelor Pasquale worships the Rembrandt-or-followers portrait of his mother (hence the Dutch-genre interiors of an 18th-century gentleman's home). He's sung by Paolo Gavanelli with a baritonal bleat reminiscent of the over-rated Rolando Panerai, not much of a lower register and only an approximate assumption of the patter that should set the liveliest duet in the opera, ""Cheti, cheti"", bouncing. Bring back Alessandro Corbelli, true master of this style. Gavanelli's duo partner in this is the Jiminy Cricket-like Doctor Dulcamara of Jacques Imbrailo - dapper, but with too fast a vibrato to phrase his first cavatina with the Italianate breadth it needs.The lovers, too, can be smart, but only Barry Banks is sweet, more than a match for the consummate orchestral trumpet solo in the forlorn Act Two aria where he does nothing much with a giant pair of scissors and a teddy bear. Despite an interval announcement of an allergic reaction, he ended up sounding as ideally light-Italian-tenor fresh as he'd started. Íride Martínez, appearing at the Royal Opera for the first time, has a good instinct for comedy, impersonating the harridan wife ""Sophronia"", but you really want a young and fruity minx of a Norina, and Martínez's voice, with its useful coloratura, has no hint of nubile sensuousness.Conductor Evelino Pidò gives them springy support, and freedom when they need it, but even a reasonably sparkling orchestra doesn't quite lift the evening. This perfectly fine vocal quartet might have made more of their tergiversations, but that would have needed a Laurent Pelly or a Caurier/ Leiser approach to set up the gags, and I'd suggest either if and when Covent Garden plans another Don Pasquale.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/don-pasquale-royal-opera,

Yet there were dangers to be negotiated. Only Irmgard Vilsmaier's Sieglinde-cum-Fricka of a mother and the ringing top of Alice Coote's Hansel as tough boy incarnate were really made to fill the crazy South Ken colosseum. The secret for the rest, and I'm sure Ticciati in his Proms debut must have worked on this, was not to force but rather to draw and coax us into Humperdinck's often startling late-Romantic clash of innocence, experience and something altogether darker, violent even.  It must have been a curious liberation for the London Philharmonic Orchestra, playing more ravishingly and buoyantly than I've ever heard them, even under Jurowski (another great interpreter of this score). Ticciati's pliancy and his achingly beautiful phrasing let the score break luminously free of any post-Wagnerian excesses or pastiche - sometimes dreaming, sometimes tripping wide-eyed into the seemingly naive folkloric world inhabited by the young Mahler.  Transitions were fluently judged, from the gurgle of clarinets into the famous dance scene, so deft and bright-eyed, and on to the shocking thud of mother's return. Pregnant pauses have become a Ticciati speciality. And the transfer made the most of the spatial effects which are the hall's biggest bonus. Father - a musicianly if not ideally bass-baritonal William Dazeley - slouched on in tracksuit bottoms and ponytail with his plastic bags from the back of the arena, clambering and slumping over rails to reach his cardboard home. Just a bit of fun, you might think, except that through all the built-in hesitations and tempo-changes of his song, he remained perfectly at one with Ticciati and the orchestra. The cuckoo and the echoes of children's voices in the dark woods were magically placed, bringing tears to the eyes along with the silky strings and pianissimo voices of Coote and Lydia Teuscher's ideally spirited Gretel in the Evening Prayer - two small children lost in the vasts of the Proms' Gargantuan maw.  The visual coup of Pelly's production, which helped to make sense of the first two acts' cardboard home and litter-strewn forest, was his supermarket witch's house, opening its chocolate-box walls to reveal serried rows of knives: a supreme invention by designer Barbara de Limburg Stirum. Here the props department had worked overtime to come up with the evening's best gag - an equally gaudy mini Albert Hall.  Performance of the year in which I first saw the Glyndebourne production came from character tenor Wolfgang Ablinger-Sperrhacke as a witch in pink twinset and pearls, swooning at first to Ticciati's proto-Rosenkavalierish waltzes (let's not forget Richard Strauss conducted the 1893 premiere, and even stole the terrified trills introducing the Sandman for Salome's fatal request). From my distant seat Ablinger-Sperrhacke's characterisation lost something in terms of creepy finer nuances, but he knows how to work a crowd, and proved repellent enough in revealing bra and prosthetic hairy belly to send one indignant bow-tied gentleman stomping from the hall.  No room on the raised strip of stage at the back of the Albert Hall platform for a scary gas oven, only a cardboard cooker into which the Witch is shoved before making a slow exit, box on head. One more visual idea remains: the rows of children whom we've seen in white in the Dream Pantomime now fat-suited and wan coming back from gingerbread limbo. As at Glyndebourne, the onlookers laughed for a moment and then took their sorry state very seriously. With Ticciati guiding their high spirits, the happy end was suitably rumbustious. And never mind the bah-humbug chap repelled by a bit of fat and hairy flesh; the kids in the audience came out thrilled to bits.Watch Wolfgang Ablinger-Sperrhacke's Witch in action in the original Glyndebourne staging by Laurent Pelly (YouTube):  ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/h%C3%A4nsel-und-gretel-glyndebourne-festival-opera-ticciati-royal-albert-hall,
767,"Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream, Shadwell Opera, Rosslyn Chapel",Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream,Shadwell Opera,2010-08-25,David Nice,"Forget Dan Brown’s phony grail trail which has led so many paying pilgrims to Rosslyn outside Edinburgh. For the last week of the Festival Fringe the Chapel, most intricate and mysterious of 15th-century sanctuaries, has become a temple of high art dedicated to Mozart, Shakespeare and Britten. Ambitious indeed of a bunch of Cambridge undergrads and alumni to mount The Magic Flute and the operatic Midsummer Night’s Dream side by side. Did they pull it off? Just, in the case of the Britten, which is saying something given a score which is... well, again, intricate and mysterious are the adjectives that spring to mind.First, certainly, find your singers – which they had, and cast them mostly well, too - but perhaps also make sure you have an orchestra of virtuosi. And here the brave attempt to find an ad hoc group of musicians prepared to come from all corners to play for free nearly sank the enterprise. The composer would not, perhaps, have recognised the aleatorics that bedevilled whole stretches of the score.Conductor Aidan Coburn held it all admirably together, but there were gaps in the texture where the cadenzaing woodwind went missing. I didn’t quite hear the soughing of the boughs in what should have been those primeval string glissandi at the beginning – though at least the forest of Rosslyn’s elaborate pillars established some kind of spell. And poor Puck’s trumpet never did quite get on the highwire. Fortunately his stage incarnation, Cambridge PhD student and DJ Ssegewa-Ssekintu Kiwanuka (pictured below right), had all the charisma needed for a new take on Robin Goodfellow very different from the pubescent boy Britten envisaged.Though this is not a singing role, Kiwanuka used his voice strikingly through several octaves. He could teach many of the nice young singers a thing or two about projection, focus and the power of stillness. You couldn’t escape the feeling sometimes that these were sophisticated choral scholars come home to roost in a chapel, for the true operatic welly needed to keep Britten’s brink-of-pallid writing for Shakespeare’s four young lovers didn’t often kick in. They looked good, though, especially in their underwear, and Rachel Bagnall’s Helena had something of the energy needed. A bit more work on the text might have helped in the difficult Act Two quarrel.Top vocal quality came from the fairy consorts. Maud Millar’s Tytania proved queenly and economical of gesture – another object lesson to many in the cast for what to do with their hands – while weaving some gorgeous upper-register spookiness, and Tom Verney’s counter-tenor Oberon suggested latent anger behind his fine-spun lines.For mechanicals, read students doing hempen-homespun. Tristan Hambleton is an elegant baritone, aristocratic of phrase, hardly a natural Bottom. His fellow rustics had the mugs, sometimes overdid the mugging and raised many of the necessary laughs in the very tragical comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe, not least Edward Leach’s gurning moon/ Snout. In this production by Jack Furness and Imogen Tedbury, their Elizabethan garb clashed – apparently was meant to, though I’m still not quite sure why – with supposedly post-rave lovers (they looked Victorian to me - and why the blond wig for Helena?), silk-dressing-gowned and angry Theseus and Hippolyta and the white, mirrored world of the fairies. Furness and Tedbury had replaced Britten’s innocent/ corrupt boy sprites with candyfloss-haired maidens singing divinely and writhing Isadoraishly.That they did too often, perhaps, and too many were crowded onto the very small platform beneath Rosslyn’s virgin. The onstage witching should surely have been left, for the most part, to the four excellent mid-teen leaders. Then, perhaps, it might not have seemed so random, along with the mysteriously roving spotlights which often appeared to be evading their targets.Something of the clarity which finally struck, both orchestrally and vocally, in the lovers’ awakening might have been brought to bear throughout: less is more always seems a difficult maxim for students to adopt. All credit to the Cantabrians, though, for their skill in occupying the still partly under-wraps chapel (the legendary Apprentice's Pillar pictured above): this has to be the most evocative of all festival venues, surely. Full marks, too, to their powers of organisation and their well-deserved sell-out run.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/brittens-midsummer-nights-dream-shadwell-opera-rosslyn-chapel,
768,"Eugene Onegin, Bolshoi Opera, Royal Opera House",Eugene Onegin,Bolshoi Opera,2010-08-13,David Nice,"Nobody knows any real happiness, and human kindness is rarely to be found, in Dmitri Tcherniakov's Bolshoi production of Tchaikovsky's ""lyric scenes"" - the most disciplined and real piece of operatic teamwork I've seen ever to come from the Russian establishment. Hollow laughter and senseless mirth envelop the traumatised, semi-autistic Tatyana of Ekaterina Shcherbachenko, one of two perfect heroines in this double-cast run and worthy of the fuss that surrounded her dewy triumph as 2009 Cardiff Singer of the World. Yet here you think not, what a marvellous singer - which she is - but instead, how painful, how humiliating and how truthful.All the characters in this true ensemble piece either have to join the line of guests around the one big dinner table that dominates events first in the country - helpful that they take up the ""peasants' chorus"" early on, so there's no need for a sensitive Russian to think of cutting it as Stanislavsky once did - and later in St Petersburg, or suffer the consequences. The period is, what? 1940s/50s dacha Russia - think Mikhailkov's Chekhovian-cum-thriller Burnt by the Sun - for Acts One and Two, which run with no interval, followed by a 1960s/70s apparatchik life of frozen luxury.The three protagonists are outsiders: aloof Onegin, uncomfortable in provincial society; his friend the poet Lensky, here a marginal butt of mockery driven to play an angry fool - as well as the secondary role of birthday-poet Triquet - with fatal consequences; and Tatyana, sitting apart from her mother's fellow guests as the curtain rises for an already sensitive handling of Tchaikovsky's melancholy introduction.There is, I'd better say straightaway, a problem with director-designer Tcherniakov's stunningly realistic and dazzlingly lit sets. The table chez Madame Larina is placed well upstage, with only a little of the action brought further forward. Even then, and in the closer yet paradoxically more frigid celebrations of the civic red room in Act Three, the singers struggle to be heard above Dmitri Jurowski's pointedly ungraceful conducting of the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra. These are the same problems of acoustic distancing experienced in Katie Mitchell's ENO Idomeneo, and it's a pity, because none of the voices is small and anything but authentically Russian in technique and projection. Surely the boxing in of the set slightly behind the proscenium arch is to blame.The leading men in this alternate cast both have their moments. Roman Shulakov starts off sounding like a bottled-up baritone but hits his stride for Lensky's clownish anger and painful alienation at the second act party, and by the time he delivers what in Pushkin's original verse-novel are the verses on the eve of his death -  delivered here to a sentimental but concerned old lady in the aftermath of the ball - we do get to hear a genuinely moving and sensitive tenor aria. Vasily Ladiuk is nowhere near as charismatic or as good an actor as Mariusz Kwiecien, to be seen on alternate nights and in the compelling DVD of this production.  But he does boast an effortless and full baritone, not as honeyed as Hvorostovsky's, say, but equally able to unfold his lecture to the lovestruck Tatyana in long and sympathetic lines. There's a slightly overblown Gremin from Mikhail Kazakov, sinister and self-important controller of his trophy wife Tatyana in Act Three, and another real bass, Valery Gilmanov, doubling as ""duel second"" Zaretsky and Captain Petrovich - luxury casting.As are the character-part ladies. In the well drawn cameo of a tippling, slightly hysterical Madame Larina, we have a former Aida and Tosca, Irina Rubtsova; as Tatyana's concerned Nurse, acting out the silly old woman but clearly deeply worried by her charge's odd behaviour, there's Irina Udalova, who once sang the role of the heroine and Turandot to boot. These are both excellent voices, indispensible for the opening duet/quartet. Oksana Volkova's true-contralto extension graces the little aria for Tatyana's flightier sister Olga, putting on merriment like everyone else but quickly angered as Onegin is later to be by the slappable blank expression of our bookish heroine.It turns out to be Tatyana's only way of coping with the social pressure. Left alone, she begins at last to relate to the phantoms of real people. The Letter Scene (pictured right) is scarily intense, Shcherbachenko's lacerating lovelorn girl furiously addressing Onegin's empty chair and seemingly summoning from her inner frustration the electric storm which hits at this great arioso's emotional climax. Again, you almost forget how beautifully she's delivering the phrases - it was her unbelievably nuanced performance of this which really clinched her Cardiff win, about which the judges were unusually unanimous - so intense is her body language. Just as powerful is her discomfort at a party which culminates not in a duel as such but a horrifying scuffle in which Lensky gets accidentally shot by his own rifle. If you think that sounds like a cop-out, you should see it: I've never come away from the second act feeling more jelly-limbed or upset.In Act Three (pictured below), Tatyana is a beehive-haired, glacial society hostess, swapping one form of social frigidity for another; but she collapses unexpectedly and heartstoppingly in her new husband's arms under the pressure of Onegin's return. It's a pity Ladiuk's stereotyped hand gestures of despair are no match for Shcherbachenko's riveting performance in the final confrontation, again uncomfortable to watch.At least here the big guns of Dmitri Jurowski's conducting are more appropriate than in a heavy-laden first act (we should be grateful, at least, that he restores the trenchant original passages Tchaikovsky later papered over with imperial display). Perhaps the young Dmitri is trying to reflect the deep unhappiness at the heart of Tcherniakov's vision, but certainly he lacks the elegance and supple sympathy with the singers that so distinguished his better-known brother's conducting of Onegin at Glyndebourne. Oddly, it matters relatively little in this unified show, unquestionably the most disquieting, perfectly thought-through and visually arresting production of the opera I've ever been privileged to see.

769,"Stravinsky, The Rake's Progress, Glyndebourne",Stravinsky,The Rake's Progress,2010-08-09,Edward Seckerson,"Thirty-five years on and this is still as much David Hockney’s Rake as it is Stravinsky’s or W H Auden’s. How rarely it is that what we see chimes so completely and utterly with what we hear. The limited palette of colours, the precisely etched cross-hatching, the directness and the cunningly conceived elements of parody – am I talking about Hockney or Stravinsky? Two great individualists in complete harmony. So why the disconnection? Is it my admittedly ambivalent relationship with Stravinsky’s dazzling score – so easy to admire, so much harder to love – an imbalance in the casting for this timely revival, or those gaping pauses between scene changes?I should address this last issue first because things were different in 1975 and the technical practicalities of effecting swift and silent shifts of scene had not really been factored into Hockney’s designs. Nor can modern technology do much about it now, it would seem. His deliciously arresting variations on the Pollock’s Toy Theatre look with its flown cloths and cut-out pieces still relies heavily on other manually moved parts – hence these groaning pauses where the music insists – no, demands – that the narrative speeds attacca from one “etching” to the next. This is the one element where Stravinsky and Hockney are most definitely not in accord. At the very least, the technical team need to work on closing these hiatuses; they are a serious hindrance.So what of the casting? Well, one tends not to think of accents as too much of a problem in the multi-lingual world of opera but there are some texts – like this one by W H Auden and Chester Kallman – that are so precise, so verbally well tuned, that any distortion in enunciation or inflection blunts the intended effect. So casting a Finn, Topi Lehtipuu (born in Australia and resident in Paris), in the title role is just a little too much impurity for one English gentleman and all the vocal coaching in the world will not eradicate those impure vowels and slightly off-kilter emphases.  That Lehtipuu looks so perfect only adds to the jarring effect of the verbal imperfections. And there is the added problem of a vocal delivery which, though light and pretty in piano, loses focus and support when the voice is pushed. This is a much heavier sing than is often acknowledged and I do wonder if Lehtipuu is simply overparted. He is most effective in the gentle delusions of the final scene where Auden and Stravinsky suddenly and discreetly become heartbreakers and Hockney so brilliantly and chillingly houses the masked inmates of Bedlam in rows of individual pens like so many battery hens. It is perhaps the single most arresting image in John Cox’s production, the other being the scene in which all the trappings of Tom’s redundant life are auctioned off and all hint of colour drains from his world leaving only the auctioneer’s crimson wig as a symbol of what might have been.  It is in that scene, of course, that the deserted Anne Trulove learns that Tom still loves her and it is that love which almost, but not quite, saves Tom from Nick Shadow’s clutches. I shall take from this revival – as I always do from this opera – the sound of the lovely Miah Persson rocking her one true love to sleep to the strains of a lullaby so simple and so deeply affecting that you wonder, as with Mozart, how Stravinsky did it. How can something so intrinsically sentimental simply not be?  Persson’s accent was so well disguised (indeed almost eradicated) as to not prove a problem for me. She looked lovely and sang dreamily, despatching her big bel canto aria “No Word from Tom” with considerable aplomb, even nailing that evil top C which most commentators now suggest was Auden’s fault – a bit of flash to appease the Italians.   The most alarming accent of the evening – Elena Manistina’s Baba the Turk – was the most delicious as if Baba had picked up inflections as well as objects from every exotic clime she visited. And it almost goes without saying – because Nick Shadow is always a scene-stealer – that Matthew Rose was a vocal and physical presence from the moment the Truloves’ garden gate swung open to reveal him, black and cross-hatched as if literally cut out of the shadows.  Vladimir Jurowski predictably relished the 18th century refractions of Stravinsky’s busy score encouraging the tightest rhythms and the most piquant displacements of accent and harmony. The London Philharmonic bassoons got to be stars. And still we went out humming the sets and probably always will.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/stravinsky-rakes-progress-glyndebourne,
770,"Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, Rattle, Royal Albert Hall",Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment,Rattle,2010-08-02,alexandra Coghlan,"In 1860 Wagner sent a full score of his recently published Tristan und Isolde to Berlioz, inscribing it: “To the great and dear composer of Roméo et Juliette, from the grateful composer of Tristan und Isolde.” The bonds between these two works go far beyond emotion, as last night’s inspired piece of programming from Simon Rattle and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment proved. A phalanx of nine double basses watching over the swollen orchestral forces of the OAE set the tone for an evening whose “authenticity” was anything but dusty.Six years after their triumphant Rhinegold, the unexpected partnership of Rattle, the OAE and Wagner have returned to the Proms, this time taking on the even greater challenge of a period Tristan – albeit only Act Two. Spanning the lovers’ move from private uncertainty to fully declared (and unwittingly public) ardour, this act has a sense of intimate detachment from the rest of the opera. Framed at the beginning and end by the receding calls of the royal hunting horns and the sudden return of King Mark, the central section sees even the faithful Brangäne melt away, leaving the two lovers alone to reach musically towards the purest expression of Wagner’s “true happiness of love”.It’s a section that makes sense as an excerpt, but demands much from singers, denied the aid either of sets or the dramatic build-up to such intensity. Leading the way was Violeta Urmana’s Isolde, whose tone is so perfectly produced as to bypass the forceful, big clichés of Wagner singing, even in a space like the Royal Albert Hall. With a purity that sits well with this determined young heroine, she captured both the expansive lines and single-minded focus of Isolde, coming into her expressive own in the charged opening discussion with Brangäne.It was lovely to see baroque darling Sarah Connolly, more often heard performing the likes of Handel with the OAE, making the transition along with the orchestra into this wildly different repertoire. Her Brangäne was ripe with gorgeous tone colours, particularly the Watchsong, her position at the back of the Choir lending it a dramatic potency matched only during the evening by Franz-Josef Selig’s heartbreaking “Mir dies?” – surely the most welcome of musical interruptions. Gravely noble and surprisingly well projected, his King Mark was a late star of the evening, taking the pressure off the massively over-faced and struggling Ben Heppner.I’ve never had the pleasure of hearing Heppner in good voice, and while I’m sure accounts of his vocal and dramatic capabilities are true, the fact remains that his notoriously troubled voice is letting him down more often than not these days. When he doesn’t actually pull out of a project he frequently sounds as though he should have, and last night was no exception. It never bodes well when a tenor is cracking and straining within the first 10 minutes of Tristan, and vocal (not to mention dramatic) suicide to attempt to carry on regardless.Carry on Heppner did, however, with a gripped tone and adolescent hope-and-a-prayer approach to top notes that simply weren’t on offer. The whole experience, far from transcendent and pure emotion, was one that left the audience nervously anticipating the next crash. Credit must go to Urmana, who staunchly continued to emote despite the intonation issues next to her, and the fact that Heppner was giving her all the dramatic impetus of a tea cosy. Heaven help next year’s Covent Garden Peter Grimes.Translucent and flexible, the “authentic” interpretation of Rattle and the OAE was so musically convincing as to overcome its novelty. The sharper than baroque, less sharp than contemporary concert pitch of A=437 took a little getting used to, but together with German instruments brought a darker timbre to proceedings that was particularly striking after the bright French textures of the Berlioz.I can’t help feeling that with his love of technical innovation and excess Wagner would have welcomed the greater brute force of the contemporary orchestra, but the clearly defined textures of the period interpretation made sense of his multi-layered motivic writing, drawing the eye more frequently beneath the dense surface of massed strings. And you can’t argue with the bluntly atmospheric impact of five single F horns – an absolute joy.With his prologue of Romeo et Juliette, Rattle placed the Wagner in context both musically and texturally. Providing a different period sound for this work (using instruments made to the French model familiar to Berlioz), the orchestra showcased the expressive range of an approach that goes beyond mere academic curiosity.With contemporary-instrument Rattle still to come at this year’s Proms, the OAE have laid down a colourful, many-textured gauntlet for the Wagner of unlikeliest of competitors, the Berlin Philharmonic.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/orchestra-age-enlightenment-rattle-royal-albert-hall,
771,"Francesca da Rimini, Opera Holland Park",Francesca da Rimini,Opera Holland Park,2010-07-31,David Nice,"They're having a laugh at Holland Park, surely: offering 700 pay-what-you-like tickets to hook newcomers on the wonderful world of opera, and then serving up a Pythonesque staging of an immoveable Italian dinosaur. Three fine singers wasted, a fourth prematurely past his prime: with these and less, director Martin Lloyd-Evans, the man who among many other things brought you Wallace and Gromit: Alive on Stage, apologetically presents Francesca da Rimini: Dead on Arrival.They're having a laugh at Holland Park, surely: offering 700 pay-what-you-like tickets to hook newcomers on the wonderful world of opera, and then serving up a Pythonesque staging of an immoveable Italian dinosaur. Three fine singers wasted, a fourth prematurely past his prime: with these and less, director Martin Lloyd-Evans, the man who among many other things brought you Wallace and Gromit: Alive on Stage, apologetically presents Francesca da Rimini: Dead on Arrival.Clearly we're not talking the Francesca of Tchaikovsky's searing fantasy overture or even Rachmaninov's already over-extended one-act opera, both indebted to all too few lines in Dante's Inferno about the adulterous lovers of Rimini. One-trick pony Riccardo Zandonai fatally modelled his 1914 extravaganza on a flatulent drama by proto-Fascist Gabriele d'Annunzio.The libretto, by publishing doyen Tito Ricordi, does nothing to pare down the purple poetry and in a second act battle between Guelphs and Ghibellines even more confusing than the background harum-scarums of Verdi's Simon Boccanegra, you might as well give up trying to understand who's doing what to whom. All this is further compounded by the mayhem of Lloyd-Evans's production, when lovers Francesca and Paolo (the usually stalwart Cheryl Barker and Julian Gavin) try their best to hold the attention on a rickety wooden battlement while chorus members do daft things with bows. Some of us shook with suppressed mirth when we weren't rigid with embarrassment.So: the music - worth enduring the halting action for? Worse plots have had better scores, that's for sure. You think Zandonai's going to serve up a feast of imaginative orchestration as conductor Phillip Thomas plunges us into trumpet tuckets and vivid colour at the start of Act One. But already Lloyd-Evans is sucking what intermittent vitality there is by having the chorus members stand like blocks of wood on stage - why? - while minor characters try to go about their sparring business. What he's begun, Zandonai quickly finishes off. Later, at least, there's a good build up of excitement from Francesca's bubbly quartet of serving women before the scene of love at first sight between Francesca and Paolo, brother of her bridegroom-to-be. It unfolds to a long, sensuous cello solo - a more exotic five-stringed antique instrument in the original - but again, our director flattens any possible glamour by having Gavin prosaically appear with his clumping entourage between the two shunted walls. What could at least look like a Straussian Presentation of the Rose goes for nothing.Can this be the same tenor who gave us such a sexy, real Cavaradossi in Catherine Malfitano's quietly brilliant English National Opera production of Tosca? Can, for that matter, Barker be the same soprano who scoured our souls as Puccini's Suor Angelica or Strauss's Salome? For a start, physically they get no help from the director; but musically, too, even their later love scenes are all foreplay and no luscious climax, though they sing out lustrously when they can. Zandonai seems to have scotched the big numbers of a more healthily vulgar Italian operatic style in favour of the through-composed music-drama of his age. But he was no Strauss or Puccini, and his Francesca is neither fish nor fowl.The lovers' dark counterparts are the lame and one-eyed Malatestas (pictured above), Francesca's husband and brother-in-law, nothing more than melodramatic stereotypes of deformity. Jeffrey Lloyd Roberts's edgy intensity is wasted on Malatestino, and Jeffrey Black's Gianciotto has a vibrato a mile wide (time was when he served as the dashing baritone of choice). But you doubt if anyone could do much with Zandonai's tiresome exploitation of that ""devil in music"" the tritone or the tediously repetitive jazzy syncopated figure that has to bear the weight of malcontent Malatestino.Francesca's four serving women fare better with several pretty Pre-Raphaelitish interludes. Each of the singers -  Madeleine Shaw, Emma Carrington, Anna Leese and Gail Pearson -  deserves equal praise for coaxing the diversions to life, and Thomas draws rather beautiful colours from the City of London Sinfonia both here and in the introduction to Paolo's and Francesca's fatal reading of an old romance. But Thomas, excellent in the cut and thrust of Verdi's Ernani at ENO and able if anyone can to bring out the best in his singers as a vocal coach second to none, has little chance to develop a line. The abrupt double murder which ends the opera is as inept musically as most of the rest. If only Zandonai and d'Annunzio, like Dante, had consigned the lovers to hell, there might have been a better epilogue. But then you came to realise that this evening was indeed hell, and we were in it.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/francesca-da-rimini-opera-holland-park,

773,"Simon Boccanegra, Royal Albert Hall",Simon Boccanegra,Royal Albert Hall,2010-07-18,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"First to crane his head anxiously in Plácido Domingo's direction was the leader of the Royal Opera House orchestra, Peter Manning. Then came an agitated look from conductor Antonio Pappano. Soprano Marina Poplavskaya clutched Domingo's chest as if to feel for a heart beat. ""Is he ok?"" we all mouthed. We had just seen Domingo slam his wizened Simon Boccanegra to the ground, dead. The music had rumbled to a close. The Prommers' applause had erupted. Yet, Domingo had remained grounded, motionless, eyes closed, face perhaps growing paler. As were ours. Was, er, Domingo, er, dead? For a few seconds, he was. Then, seconds later, he wasn't. That's acting for you, folks!It would be grotesque of me to say that that was my favourite moment of this Proms night. The three hours of intense, serious, superlative singing and acting surely trumped Domingo's Chaplin-esque minute of playing dead. Even so, that minute of madness was certainly the most dramatic minute of the evening. Verdi's 1857 opera Simon Boccanegra (revised in 1881) has many musical things going for it - the woodwind writing, for example, in the Prologue and First Act is mesmerising - but dramatically speaking, it's lousy. Most of the problem lies with having a Mandela-like heroic saint for a lead. What drama there is here consists of people lamely plotting against Boccanegra, then lamely realising the error of their ways. There are emotional truths to be found in the cracks - especially in Boccanegra's relationship to his daughter - but the main dramatic, quasi-political thrust to the work is phooey. It was like being stuck inside the head of Gordon Brown.One can usually blame the semi-stagers for the dramatic sluggishness of operas in concert - though, according to David Nice's review of the Covent Garden production, a semi-staging was the best staging this Elijah Moshinsky number was ever going to get. Certainly none of the villains had anywhere near enough villainy within them to provide a decent counterweight to Boccanegra's moral levitation. Having said this, Jonathan Summers's Paolo was impressively snarly and short; his voice is made for Disney wickedness. Ferruccio Furlanetto - so consistent vocally - needed a bit more characterful welly such as we saw from his Philip II in Don Carlo last year.Joseph Calleja, playing the not-so-villainous-really Gabriele Adorno, was nicely headstrong, his voice moving wilfully into the stratosphere. It seems churlish to criticise his aria ""Sento avvampar nell' anima"", which rightly brought the house down, but the perfection of this rendition emphasised again the psychological lack to proceedings. Marina Poplavskaya (Amelia) was all subtlety, whether riding the radiant dawn waltz at the start of Act One with a surfer's ease, or spasming off into that small trill in the council scene.But it was Domingo's night. I had to blink twice when he first bounded onto the stage. How old is that man? In the Prologue he could have passed for 30. He could also now quite easily pass as a baritone - throughout. He seems to have completed the vocal transition, remarkably. In a world where many singers singing in their favoured voices have lines and fissures running all along their tessitura, Domingo's flawless sound (only a touch too gravelly at the very bottom) is a marvel.Pappano did his best with a score that yields interest only intemittently and mostly in the first half. The climax to Act One brings about the most exciting moment: a fantastical discrepancy of sound between the hushed, almost sucked, exhalation of a choir in whispered cry and the outward crash of cymbal and orchestra at full tilt. Now that's what I call drama. I wish there'd been more. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/simon-boccanegra-royal-albert-hall,
774,"Die Meistersinger at the Proms, BBC Four",Die Meistersinger at the Proms,BBC Four,2010-07-18,David Nice,"In fact, from what I saw, it did wonderful things in quite a different way, even if when left to their own devices the singers became a tad more conventional in their very exposed acting-out, for all the eloquent hand gestures which were mostly a legacy of Richard Jones's meticulous staging. At least it was an integrated, meaningful ensemble in the way that the eight singers of the previous Prom's Mahler Eight certainly hadn't been, nor ever would be even given more rehearsal time.  So how did BBC Four handle it? Pretty well, from my partial view, though glimpses of the first act suggested that the cameras weren't always where they were supposed to be, and that the television mikes were never turned on downstage left (that remained a problem, critically, until the last). Stephen Fry is possibly the only telly personality apart from Antonio Pappano who could get away with saying plenty of probing and intelligent things about the nature of drama. I was utterly convinced - until he let slip a blunder about the crucial positioning of the chorus's paean to Sachs, ""Wach auf!"", in Act Three, a moment when, as one reviewer put it, the whole of Wales seems to salute its hero Bryn Terfel. And I wouldn't blame Fry for discombobulation at the end, when he sounded as if he'd been crying - don't worry, Stephen, I was too - and started gushing in some very strange places (how on earth would anyone be able to tell from the bit part that the performance of minor Meister Nachtigall was ""wonderful""?) Good, anyway, to have more experienced gravitas from Nicholas Payne, former Royal Opera supremo. Plus perfectly eloquent little interviews with Terfel and Lothar Koenigs, the outstanding WNO music director.   Koenigs (pictured right by Chris Christodoulou) and his orchestra seemed to have got even better since the first night in Cardiff. The relatively small ensemble looked almost lost on the Albert Hall stage, but that's no doubt the kind of modest size Wagner intended. They kept the action afloat, the woodwinds sounded even more luminous than they had in the Millennium Centre, and overwhelming climaxes always made their mark. A wrong entry or two suggested understandable fatigue, as did Bryn's final monologue, but at least they weren't sweltering in high temperatures.   In front of Koenigs, the singer-actors did an economical little bit of their stuff. With the men all in black open-necked shirts, there was a touch of Brechtian alienation and none of the class/ status distinctions you got in the production. In close-up, some could look just a little over-emphatic, but they all seemed so physically at ease, which can't have been easy on presumably only one rehearsal in the giant venue. Odd that Bryn should have developed a self-protective arm-folding gesture perhaps at odds with natural man Sachs. But he was so in command of the words, and, as they say, so owned the stage that his massive charisma must have put some of the less experienced singers at their ease. Christopher Purves's Beckmesser, a rather different stage animal in the Albert Hall but consummate as ever, certainly didn't need it. And Raymond Very seemed amazingly relaxed, easy and taken with the spirit this time when it came to Walter's ""Prize Song"". Smile, chorus, though, please, when you're supposed to be having fun on the banks of the River Pegnitz.  How do they all feel this morning? They've done what for many will be the run of their lives and, according to Jones, there are no plans to bring it back - too expensive - or share it with another house (the big companies all want their own epics, apparently, even in straitened times). Jones shrugged off the laments that no-one had filmed the show - that's the now-you-see-it-now-you-don't nature of theatre, he replied - but at least this Proms performance has been captured for ever. And why am I up so early on a Sunday morning writing about it? Because Wagner at full inspired pelt never lets you sleep for long.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/die-meistersinger-proms-bbc-four,
775,"The Duchess of Malfi, ENO, Punchdrunk",The Duchess of Malfi,ENO,2010-07-14,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"It's tough being a critic. There I was last night at Punchdrunk's first operatic foray, The Duchess of Malfi - put on in collaboration with the English National Opera - trying to make sense of a typically Punchdrunkian world that had been shattered across three never-ending floors of disused office space in the back of beyond, attempting to maintain objectivity, coolness, clarity, soberly parsing the multifarious activity, diligently attending the sporadic music-making, scribbling it all down nerdily in my notepad, when a dishy young performer nobbles me, drags me into a darkened room, locks the door, pins me to the wall and gives me one of the most intimate non-sexual encounters of my life. Needless to say, I had fun.Which was a nice change. Because up to that point - about an hour in - it hadn't been that fun at all. For sure, for this Punchdrunk virgin, it was impossible not to be intrigued by the Punchdrunk system: the compulsory long-nosed masks for the audience that did so much to heighten the drama and alienate us from each other, the narrative revelations in the fabric of the rooms and the intermingling of the actors and musicians and us. But it was impossible not to be baffled too. If you like to understand things, follow things, learn from your dramatic experiences, then this narrative soup, devoid of any form of elucidation (or surtitles), will not wash.But accept Punchdrunk as mess-makers, accept them as precocious children sitting in their high chairs, shredding and hurling and scattering dramatic narrative in any and every direction, shattering linearity and intelligibility, littering dramatic fragments across vast deserted urban wildernesses, while demanding viewers give literal chase to the scraps, and enjoyment - of a somewhat cheap kind, the sort you might get from a murder mystery weekend - will come. You might not learn much from your time with Punchdrunk but you almost certainly will feel things. The Punchdrunk experience is a visceral one, a sensual one. Your sense of smell, touch, sight and hearing is on constant watch - far more than your intellect. And you may even get nobbled.This is more than enough for a lot of initial intrigue and goodwill, which soon turns to frustration as one hunts around for some action, opera, singing, acting, and tries to get away from the brooding ambient stock horror sound that pervades much of the building, then finds oneself staring at unaccompanied music stands and spending more time chasing musicians (I followed a bassoonist into the toilets by mistake) than hearing them play.The Punchdrunk experience is a resolutely (deliberately almost) hit-and-miss experience. Punchdrunk offers you a world and you must assemble it - for better or worse. Choose a different path through this bizarre maze of rooms and floors - as I did after my little encounter - and the music started to flow and the experience began to take on some value. Rather lame but spooky and kooky design ideas - candles, stuffed animals, medical bottles, prams, crosses, sub-Joseph Cornell-like arrangements - were replaced by more genuinely chilling events, the beating of a naked man over a heap of old TVs or an aria conducted in pitch black, the audience stumbling over each other like blind wretches. Indeed, the last hour was full of excitement - stay to the end whatever you do.But The Duchess of Malfi must also be judged as opera. And as opera, it resolutely failed. The aleatoric nature to proceedings works least well with the musical element. The contemporary musical language that composer Torsten Rasch composes in would be tricky to follow in concert. Left to us to assemble, the music makes little overarching sense at all, except in the final 20-minute passage, where, all corralled into the biggest room of the evening, we hear a work from beginning to end.Yet, despite all these reservations, despite the lack of intelligibility, despite the mild pretentiousness, despite the fashiony qualities to some of the staging, despite the unashamed pilfering of 40 years of installation art, I still get the feeling that Punchdrunk have struck some sort of gold with this event. The Duchess of Malfi is a mess, but a wonderfully rich mess, intricate, detailed, meticulously planned, beautiful at times, thrilling at times, cheap - mining sex and religion for its grandest statements - but also glorious, excessive and gaudy. It is also by far the hippest opera or classical music has ever got. The art forms must learn from it. But in the right way. For The Duchess of Malfi is an unmissable production, but it is also an operatic mess.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/duchess-malfi-eno-punchdrunk,
776,"La Traviata, Royal Opera",La Traviata,Royal Opera,2010-07-08,ismene Brown,"Of course she isn't now the watchful, learning 29-year-old who premiered Covent Garden’s opulent, sensually loaded production in 1995, but Gheorghiu’s varicoloured voice - a rainbow of tears, sobs, scoops, warbling runs and top notes that seem to rack her body with pain - has if anything added more colours since then (including a less fetching jeune-fille timbre in the middle that sounds as if it’s hiding a problem). When in the overture the front-cloth loads its antique photograph of a plain, dumpy little girl with despairing eyes, and then fades to show Gheorghiu pensively sitting alone behind it, a dazzling picture in white, even if the faces don’t match the thoughts do. This character is all cover-up on expenses, with memories she dare share with no one, and no other future she dare think about than the here and now.Whether it’s Gheorghiu’s history as a Ceausescu child in a benighted Romania, she does drive the callousness of Violetta’s story with a devastating emotional power, and it may be why her incarnation of Richard Eyre’s production and Bob Crowley’s almost fascistic set still feels so right 15 years later. The world Eyre and Crowley create is super-glamorous, it’s magnetic, it’s empty, it’s an auction-house awaiting a prize object. That golden bowl of a salon at her place, that swirling, vertiginous red cardroom at Flora Bervoix’s, these are places built for males to admire and buy women in, and the tricksier she is the higher her price. (pictured above, Gheorghiu in Act 1)Sir Richard took a curtain call last night, and I wondered if he coached Gheorghiu in her febrile little gestures - the vulgar way she wiped her lips when she was kissed was one that caught my eye, and the way in “Sempre libera” she plucked at her gorgeous dress in something like disgust, the hint that Violetta, under her scintillating appearance, is used to quick changes of underwear. A great Violetta has a voice to register all those myriad collisions of fact and feeling, a voice etched with fragilities and secret worries, plus the iron technical strength to wring every last drop of pathos from all those textures, and for me it's Ileana Cotrubas, Callas of course, and Gheorghiu who stand out far from the armies of more golden, rational sopranos.But her absorption in her own beauty has made the Romanian more calculating as an actress than the other two, and last night I frequently found myself shutting my eyes to close off her more-is-more school of eyebrow-dancing, and just soaking in that addictive, succulent voice which can be so affectingly sincere.  And her timing is interesting too, wilful, even jazzy here and there in Act Two - giving the responsive Yves Abel in the pit quite a runaround in places - yet it's not theatrically uncreative. Her duet with the reproving father, Zelko Lucic, was sensational last night; he standing stolid and as full of male clichés as a Provençal wine-merchant, she the reckless young Parisienne with too little control over her emotions.Still, there is also attention to be paid to her tenor, making his Covent Garden debut a few months after his Metropolitan Opera debut in this role, and with a big US singing prize under his belt that tells us that James Valenti, at 32, is being set up for a major career (pictured right with Gheorghiu in Act 3). He certainly stands out. For one thing he is 6ft 5in tall, and has a beaky modern face, like Christopher Ecclestone, quite priestly, and for another, this very unItalian-looking person possesses a warm, high and full tenor voice of genuine beauty and distinction, which he delivers with a nice sincerity, if not yet quite the full Italian striker emotional kit. Nerves must have played their part in sandbagging the final outcome of his Act Two double-whammy “De miei bollenti spiriti... O, mio rimorso! O, infamia!"" after an excellent start. There is obviously an outstanding voice in the making here, though it's early days, and I'm not sure Verdi is his natural emploi unless he gets sharper Italian pronunciation and some welly in his ornaments and top notes.The wardrobe-shaped Lucic may not look remotely genetically related to Valenti, but he gave a fine, reticent portrayal of a slowly melting Germont, despite not being much in tune with Eyre’s naturalistic acting requirements. Good sounds and playing from Changhan Lim and Kai Rüütel, two Jette Parker Young Artists at the ROH, as Flora Bervoix and her patron, and Sarah Pring made an unusually impactful acting part of Annina, Violetta’s maid.Abel kept the evening well-sprung and swift on its toes from the pit, and made some great moments with Gheorghiu: in the juddering, heart-pounding pulse that he set for the dazed finale of Act Two, and in the last act, where the thread of sound that came from her throat alongside the sweet, lonely heedlessness of the violin sounds, as thin and wavering as a candle flame, the gentle valedictory of “Addio del passato”, the gruff grunts of the horns under her dying song, “Se una pudica virgine”, made the tragedy as piercing as it could be. I’m afraid I was in floods.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-traviata-royal-opera,

778,"Salome, Royal Opera",Salome,Royal Opera,2010-07-07,David Nice,"The first time I saw David McVicar's production of Strauss's hypersensuous shocker, I gaped in horrified wonder at the Pasolini Salò-style mise en scène but didn't find the action within it fully realised. When it came out on DVD, the close-ups won greater respect but there was still the problem of Nadja Michael's singing, hardly a note in true. Now it returns with Angela Denoke, an even more compelling actress with a far healthier soprano voice.In league with Hartmut Haenchen's pacy conducting she makes you think first, what an incredible score, and only then, what a brilliant production. As with ENO's Tosca, you can't ask for more than that. The first time I saw David McVicar's production of Strauss's hypersensuous shocker, I gaped in horrified wonder at the Pasolini Salò-style mise en scène but didn't find the action within it fully realised. When it came out on DVD, the close-ups won greater respect but there was still the problem of Nadja Michael's singing, hardly a note in true. Now it returns with Angela Denoke, an even more compelling actress with a far healthier soprano voice. In league with Hartmut Haenchen's pacy conducting she makes you think first, what an incredible score, and only then, what a brilliant production. As with ENO's Tosca, you can't ask for more than that.It's been said that nothing can live up to McVicar's opening tableau, where designer Es Devlin's evocation of the Pasolini film, hauntingly lit by Wolfgang Göbbel, features a naked girl, a floor-mopper and soldiers in a grimy clinical kitchen underbelly while guests of the awful Herods dine above. Yet with Denoke to hold our hand through accumulating horrors, on this occasion it just gets better, which is of course worse in dramatic terms. She metamorphoses utterly convincingly from a capricious teenage virgin - or at least a teenager as she might be played by an ageing Hollywood starlet, which is fine - to a woman of immortal but unquenchable yearning in the bloody awful mess of a denouement.The voice is only just up to the demands of this impossible role, a 16-year-old with the voice of an Isolde, as Strauss once put it. Not every top note gets cranked to the pitch-perfect fullness it needs: Denoke doesn't have the opulence of Cheryl Barker, a superb Salome at ENO, or quite the luminous cute-but-mind-the claws kittenishness of her great forbear Hildegard Behrens (my overwhelming introduction to this masterpiece at Covent Garden). The voice blends with the powerful orchestra and is occasionally, inevitably, smothered by it rather than riding triumphant. Yet she does bring the right sense of spangled wonder to her opening scenes, and when relaxed in boredom or anticipation of the gift she's going to ask from her stepfather - the head of John the Baptist - the years seem to fall away. Her physicality is various and never excessive, as it often was from the fine singing actors in Tcherniakov's Aix Don Giovanni: unforgettable the way she paces for her reward around the desperate Herod like a caged lion, then suddenly does a little dance-skip which only ratchets up the tension.One-to-ones work as they never begin to do in the concurrent Boccanegra, which is impressive as McVicar's original concept is revived here by Justin Way. I've seen Johan Reuter's Jokanaan (pictured right with Denoke's Salome) taken to task for barking, but he didn't bark last night, though he was never allowed to make the prophet's rhapsodies smoothly beautiful either. It's important that the shaggy prisoner's rants do even more to turn Salome's wits than the depraved court around her, and in conjunction with Haenchen's forward propulsion, that was powerfully underlined here, culminating in a truly horrible curse over Salome's recumbent figure.Gerhard Siegel's Herod (pictured below with Denoke) was a huge improvement on the strong-voiced but dramatically inert Thomas Moser in 2008. There was the right sort of black comedy in his increasingly batty offers to Salome of anything but the head, compounded by the steely cut of Irina Mishura's harridan wife. Though his smaller, rounder figure looks faintly ridiculous up against Denoke's tall personage, there was nothing funny about the elaborately staged Dance, a psychodrama of seven doors like Bluebeard's Castle as Andrew George's choreography stylishly underlines the child abuse Denoke has already conveyed in her horror at being touched by either of her elders. Yes, it turns into a dripping Viennese waltz, and when have we ever seen it danced as such?There's strong supporting singing from Adrian Thompson, leading the theological bickering that needs the tightest of guidance which it got here, and Andrew Staples as the infatuated Narraboth, but it's the easy, unfussy decadence or oppression suggested by the actors which really fleshes out the setting. Haenchen's conducting inspires confidence from the first, spacious clarinet run conjuring the Palestinian night. He whips up a precise storm in the vortexes of frustrated desire, makes sure there are no longueurs in the early stages, as there can be with a less expert pacing, finds funny little rhythmic kinks in the dance and encourages eerie string slides - never more striking than the smeary lines after Salome has kissed the head - as well as bubbling woodwind detail. I've heard more refined accounts, but never one which kept the momentum going better or gave one more cause to marvel at the fact that, 105 years on, Strauss's score has lost none of its power to stun and bewitch. MORE RICHARD STRAUSS ON THEARTSDESKDer Rosenkavalier, Royal Opera (2009).

779,"Don Giovanni live from Aix, Ciné Lumière",Don Giovanni live from Aix,Ciné Lumière,2010-07-06,David Nice,"With several replicas of Mozart's libertine stalking the country this summer, there had to be a good reason for seeking him out in the cinema. I had two. One was a curiosity to see how the TV channel Arte and the French Institute in South Kensington would handle a medium so successfully exploited around the world by New York's Metropolitan Opera. The other was to find out whether flavour-of-the-year Russian director Dmitri Tcherniakov could follow up his oddball but compellingly detailed takes on Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin and Prokofiev's The Gambler as disintegrating haut bourgeois or nouveau riche family dramas. Yes, this was another, equally well cast for the most part, but so skewed as to need a completely rewritten libretto.We can accept the occasional disjunction between text and action if a director's update makes for sufficiently compulsive viewing. There were far too many here, not least Don Giovanni's ""I smell a woman"" when Donna Elvira is standing right there facing him and his asking Zerlina her name when they've already been presented as members of the same family. And therein lay the special problem: in the mincing spoken introduction, we were to take on board that Giovanni and Elvira were a married couple, Donna Anna the mother of Zerlina with Don Ottavio lined up for husband number two, Leporello a slightly deranged relative. So out went the class distinctions and most of the wit, and in their place only a vague family ambience was established in the action itself.Curtain up far too late (8.40pm English time) on a sticky night in Aix's Archbishop's Palace as Louis Langrée drew cut and thrust from the Freiburg Barockorchester in the overture's statue-comes-to-dinner thunderbolt: there's the Commendatore (Anatoli Kotscherga) as Big Daddy in a sharp suit and designer specs welcoming his brood to table in a reception room lined with bought-in, presumably unread books. The stylish facades soon disintegrate into melancholy and madness, of which Bo Skovhus's Giovanni is only the most charismatic manifestation. Donna Anna (a coloratura soprano, blonde bombshell Marlis Petersen, rather than the usual heavier dramatic voice) wants, as is I think mistakenly underlined in all recent productions, what Giovanni has to offer before dad breaks in on the scene and in a scuffle - which I missed as I had to rush out and tell the projectionist to turn the distorted sound down - bashes his head on the bookcase and drops dead.From that point on, it's a psychological slippery slope for everyone, above all Skovhus's disintegrating waster in a camel coat who veers between deep, fixed-staring depression and gibbering about like a demented ape. He's been singing the role for a quarter of a century, and the never too weighty voice now bears witness to that. It's none too helpfully contrasted with Kyle Ketelsen's deliberately repulsive but vocally resplendent Leporello. Tcherniakov wants his bourgeois implosion to happen over time, not Mozart and Da Ponte's taut 24 hours. So we have interminable dropped black curtains while days and weeks are supposed to pass. The Commendatore dies. Blackout (the cameras, accidentally it seems, show us the set-dressing behind the dropcloth. They won't do that again). Donna Anna and Don Ottavio sing at dad's funeral. Long blackout. Elvira - the utterly compelling Kristine Opolais -  turns up. Blackout. And so on - all in the same room, so strictly there's little scenery to be changed. It's maddening, because Langrée's quicksilver conducting and the intensity with which Tcherniakov gets his singing actors to fill their set-pieces with meaning both set the ball rolling when there's a chance.Some ideas don't work; others reveal scenes as we've never seen them before. Kerstin Avemo's bewitchingly strange baby-doll Zerlina is transfixed by an immobile Skovhus's extended hand before she moves, hypnotised, across the floor towards him. Petersen delivers Anna's ""Or sai che l'onore"" while undressing the impassive Ottavio and imagining it's Giovanni - half-hearted boos, presumably for the concept; Colin Balzer, flawless of technique in both his arias, responds with a strangely moving ""Dalla sua pace"", trying to have sex with his now frigid fiancée before lying across her chest like a child. The sublime trio of the ""masks"" brings an onstage Giovanni his only moment of peace apart from a delirious Act Two serenade; then the masks really are applied and unlikely couples come together, kiss violently and separate.The second half, for those of us able to stay way beyond midnight, saw rather too much repetition of estrangement and insanity from the discombobulated family members, but each delivered the increasingly difficult arias with focused expression and commitment. The banquet from hell is a farce - the family's paid an actor to don Commendatore beard and specs to give Skovhus's Giovanni his long-anticipated heart attack. He lies dying as the rest of the family finish him off and walk away. A successful concept? By no means entirely, and it didn't help that the cameras weren't always were they were supposed to be - too many leg and arm shots. But it's so easy to make a dog's dinner of Don Giovanni these days, as did Zambello at Covent Garden, the unspeakable Bieito at the Coli and, if the recent TAD review is to be trusted, and experience suggests it is, the mediocre Jonathan Kent  at Glyndebourne. Tcherniakov's vision, roundly booed at Aix as he came on for his bow, is consistent and, with superbly realistic acting from his singers, brands many images on the memory. He'll be making even bigger splashes in the near future.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/don-giovanni-live-aix-cin%C3%A9-lumi%C3%A8re,

781,"Don Giovanni, Glyndebourne Festival Opera",Don Giovanni,Glyndebourne Festival Opera,2010-07-04,Jonathan Wikeley,"It seems somehow wrong to come away from a Don Giovanni feeling a bit noncommittal about the whole thing. It’s the sort of opera that should raise you from your seat – that should fire and inspire – but this performance, directed by Jonathan Kent, never truly got off the ground. The set – a sort of Rubik's Cube of a building designed by Paul Brown that opened in ever more ingenious ways, and morphed from chapel to party house to graveyard – was clever and satisfying and mirrored the steady disintegration of the characters as we progressed. But without the intensity and the drama from these characters, it was rather wasted.Gerald Finley was a toff of a Don Giovanni, who wouldn’t have been out of place lounging across the Glyndebourne lawns and dragging off a lady or two to have a quick romp with in the bushes. Of course, we all know that Don Giovanni has his arrogant bounder side, but there has to be a bit more swagger, a bit more sex, a bit more inherent loutishness there too – I bet the larger part of the Don’s 1,003 Spanish conquests were from the equivalents of Magaluf and Torremolinos, and he wouldn't have got those wearing a white DJ. Finley’s rather preppy look suggested he’d be happier picking up freshers at Oxford.As with the appearance, so with the voice. There’s a natural lightness to Finley’s voice that can be very attractive, but it didn’t do it for me last night – there just wasn’t the gravel there to grip as it might have done. In contrast, Leporello, played by Luca Pisaroni, was rather stylish in his haplessness, with a roguish air that was distinctly appealing and a tone that suited his more cagey character well. The other performers were all decent, but I wasn’t left rocked by any of them. Kate Royal was a disappointment as Donna Elvira, as was William Burden as Don Ottavio: the former seemed to have left her voice at home, the latter was unmemorably beige. Anna Samuil (Donna Anna) was considerably more gutsy, with a voice that carried much better than the others, and Anna Virovlanssky was pleasantly and cutely coquettish as Zerlina.Underpinning this was the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, directed by Vladimir Jurowski. There were some pleasantly rich sounds emanating from the pit from time to time, and there was plenty of depth to be found in the playing, though it felt extremely serious - lacking in essential sparkle and wit. A number of timing issues when the orchestra was positioned around the stalls created the occasional aural equivalent of watching 3D television without the glasses.The thing is, this Don Giovanni wasn’t bad, it just wasn’t brilliant, and you rather hope for brilliant at Glyndebourne. I’m not sure what they need to do to provide that extra zip and zing, but I’m sure it wouldn’t take much. Let’s hope they find it before the end of the run.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/don-giovanni-glyndebourne-festival-opera,
782,"Semele, Théâtre de Champs-Élysées",Semele,Théâtre de Champs,2010-07-01,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"David McVicar's revival production of Handel's oratorio-cum-opera Semele isn't terribly clever or beautiful or impressive, or fecund with ideas or detail or emotion. But it does work. It does tell the story. And what brings colour to its initially rather pasty, unappealing face, and fire and heft to its anaemic belly, is sex and - best of all for those of you who will only be able to catch it in concert at the Barbican next week - one of the most impressive Handel casts I've heard for years.Appropriately for a production as deliberately confused in concept as this one - where the characters are neither divine, nor human, nor symbolic, nor Enlightenment but hover somewhere between all possible poles - we start in the fog, albeit a glamorously dry-ice fog. It clears to reveal a scene of complete WAG-like tastefulness. This still, careful, Nineties minimalism - white amphitheatre, chairs, balcony - gives no sense of the turbulence of the opening scenario: the cliffhanger wedding, the horrifically solipsistic bride, Semele, having second thoughts, the wretched lover, Ino, in desperation. Rousset doesn't help by driving Les Talens Lyrique forcefully, straightening every possible curve, cutting short every possible sigh. It was twiddle-your-thumbs time until the entry of Claire Debono's blind Cupid, I'm afraid.With the emergence of this snaky, sexy, sequenced, Enlightenment glam rocker (pure Peter Greenaway) - whose glistening red tails and bizarre cavorting (not quite hash-induced, not quite cocaine-induced, not quite lost, just weird) mirrored perfectly the slinky bejewelled duplets on oboe and strings that Rousset was conjuring up - and her knowingly stagy, androgynous cabaret performance in dark glasses, the whole production took off. And it repeatedly took off whenever she returned, even when she wasn't singing.  The rest of the production - which never went one way or the other, surreal or real, divine or earthly, symbolic or natural - couldn't match up to this inspired idea, which burnt so bright that it consumed all around it.But it did do enough to facilitate the basics of this cautionary tale on being careful about what you wish for and to project an idea of the lustful characters and the singing. Debono delivered the finest couple of stand-alone arias of the night in her two gem-like exhortations. Richard Croft's Jupiter, a male playing to wife-battering type: horny, self-pitying and violent, dispatched his part expertly. Peter Rose's incredibly solid, fabulously old-school interventions as a stentorian Cadmus and comically sleepy Somnus, reminded one how important a good bass is to the working of a Handel opera - and how rarely we hear one of this calibre.Danielle de Niese's Semele should have been the star turn. And in many ways she was. In terms of coloratura, control and word-setting, she shone. And her voice is bigger, stronger than I have ever heard it. But one always gets the feeling with De Niese that she thinks she's a better, sexier, more watchable performer than she really is. She's Jessica Rabbit-pretty, for sure, but she's also Jessica Rabbit-subtle too. Flutter, flutter, slinky, slinky. It's like watching a Benny Hill girl at times. And even her voice has its unsubtleties, its pop sensibilities and pop slides. In fact, she goes so much of the way to making a nice sound that many forget how far away she is from making a truly brilliant sound.When she's singing with Vivica Genaux (Juno and Ino), however, the discrepancy starts to show. Genaux is a very classy act, with a molasses-like voice that sometimes one feels should be harder to shift. And she always does more with less. Jaël Azzaretti was a characterful, springy, amusing sidekick to Genaux's Juno. Stephen Wallace's Athamas, small, timid at first, flourished as things progressed. The choir were stylish and incomprehensible as the French are inclined to be.Meanwhile, the production trudged on in its cold, abstract furrow, attempting to conjure up some new ritual - neither Greek, nor Enlightenment, nor modern, nor entertaining, but a combination of all - to little effect. And it fell to Cupid once again to save the day, which she did by lolling onto stage in her addled fashion with a pram cradling a bottle of champagne and presenting it to the newly-weds. The evening deserved one too.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/semele-th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre-de-champs-%C3%A9lys%C3%A9es,
783,"Simon Boccanegra, Royal Opera House",Simon Boccanegra,Royal Opera House,2010-06-29,David Nice,"I'll admit that many of us were spoiled by the last revival of Boccanegra at Covent Garden - also of Verdi's most often heard and masterly revision, like the current staging, but using Ian Judge's production of the original version - boasting a near-perfect quartet of principals who all meshed with each other. The only survivor from that team to be seen in the latest showing is Ferrucio Furlanetto (pictured with Domingo above), whose Prologue aria as the vengeful father of Boccanegra's ill-fated love was cheered to the rafters then but barely made an impact this time, oddly over-acted and ending off-pitch (as did three of the ensuing duets).None of the other leads on this occasion was seriously below par, but none engaged in the crucial one-to-ones as had Lucio Gallo, Anja Harteros and Marcus Haddock back in 2008. If Maria Poplavskaya doesn't sort out her occluded sound soon, she'll either crash or become a mezzo - and not a Verdi mezzo either. Which would be a shame as she's always a sympathetic presence, comes closer to suggesting Boccanegra's 25-year-old virginal daughter than most sopranos to essay the part and actually produces some very stylish Italianate spinto lines in later scenes. Joseph Calleja is your stock stand-and-deliver tenor, with an unusual, slightly bleaty production but always a confident, ringing top. He and Poplavskaya never engaged - in fact no-one did - but sang well in the big Act One ensemble (Calleja and Poplavskaya pictured either side of Domingo below).Which is where the evening finally gathered some momentum. Moshinsky's murk, for all the monumental handsomeness of Michael Yeargan's designs, has given us no help  in working out the background squabbles of Guelphs and Ghibellines, a fault in the shaky original libretto of 1857; but when Verdi drafted Boito in to write a new Council Chamber scene in 1881 just before their joint work on Otello, intelligibility rose a notch and the music reaches new, noble heights. Domingo, who sang well in the crucial father-daughter reconciliation of the previous scene but, with no help from the director, was the only Boccanegra who's failed to move me in this glorious duet, grasped the nettle in his one-man authority stunt. The big plea for peace between the warring Genoan factions, surprisingly well echoed by Poplavskaya's Amelia as very much her father's child, duly thrilled. And then Domingo pulled out new reserves of darker colour in the chilling threat to the depraved  Paolo (Jonathan Summers, a Boccanegra of yore warning us what happens when a real baritone voice truly does wear and tear).After that later flourish, Verdi's opera-by-numbers in the second and third acts really needs to be kept afloat by the interaction of the four principals, which again it wasn't here. Only the sleep which follows on the heels of Boccanegra's knocking back a poisoned drink and the sea breezes which refresh his hour of death really hit the heights - partly by force of Domingo's sheer charisma when left to himself, partly by the incredible sensitivity to the high and low orchestral sonorities Antonio Pappano draws from the Royal Opera Orchestra. His is for the most part - with the exception of the big ensemble scene, superbly handled - an intimate account alert to every nuance in the score. If only it had a smaller-scale production to match. For once, the 'semi-staged' performance promised for the Prom on 18 July really ought to have the edge.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/simon-boccanegra-royal-opera-house,
784,"Zaide, Sadler's Wells",Zaide,Sadler's Wells,2010-06-27,peter Culshaw,"The story starts promisingly with a love story between a prisoner Gomatz and Zaide, the favourite concubine of the tyrant Soliman. The two lovers escape with the help of Allazim. They are re-captured. Then Mozart gave up. His sources for the story, by Sebastiani and Voltaire’s  Zaïre, ended it by the dubious plot twist that Zaide and Gomatz are actually brother and sister and that Allazim saved Soliman’s life some years earlier and he lets them all free. The strongest bits of the unfinished opera are a few arias, notably “Ruhe sanft” – which has become a concert staple. Perhaps Mozart realised his great love aria would have to end up being incestuous and lost the will to finish it. Or he could have had Soliman kill them all off, but had been told the Viennese found the story too serious already.This production does finish the opera, with bits of other Mozart music used and English words by Michael Symmons Roberts (sung text) and Ben Power and Molly Still (spoken text) but in an unconvincing manner. Soliman does the right thing in the end. One of the problems is the modern setting as Soliman looks, with his white shirt and silk trousers, like a suburban nightclub owner running a smart but casual evening, rather than a vicious tyrant. A red carpet with a few scattered cushions from Heals does not a harem or tyrant’s HQ make.   The orchestra were blameless and had an excellent esprit de corps, even if the sound was a bit muddy at times, and the cast are generally fine singers. The Classical Opera Company are known for nurturing singers, notably the rich, unconventional and strong (if unstable at times) voice of the South African Pumeza Matshikiza in the title role, but the modern setting and English translations require a level of acting that is beyond this cast. You yearned, as I never thought I would, for the old days: stick a fabulous costume on and “park and bark”, as the expressive phrase had it.  The direction is busy at all times, with lots of little actions happening off-centre (prison guards playing cards, that kind of thing) which is distracting. There was some kind of shadow puppetry going on, which either more should have been made of or cut. A half-seen scaffold was laboriously wheeled about at the back for no good reason.   The wordsmiths made a sterling effort but the English lyrics, when they could be heard, were often banal, perhaps inevitably: “Don’t leave me” has to rhyme like any of a thousand pop songs with “deceive me” and “believe me”. Occasionally it strayed into higher levels, with some effective verses: ""When love is just possession, and lust becomes obsession/The fruit dies on its vine, and no one drinks the wine"".  Perhaps unfortunately, this production had to compete with Peter Sellars’s version of a couple of years ago, which I saw in Vienna, and which had a wonderful design, set in a New York sweatshop. Sellars may well be off his trolley in claiming that Mozart was a hardcore revolutionary, but his production brought out the racial and slavery elements inherent in the piece (with the likes of Amnesty giving a talk before the show) and confronted the “clash of civilisations” between the Muslim and Christian worlds head on. Sellars, probably sensibly, didn’t finish the piece, but left hanging in the air the question, as he put it, ""Do we want compassion and to discover mutual truths, or have a fight to the death?"" Which at least gave the piece a rich contemporary reference.   This production, by not setting the piece anywhere in particular, raised little in the way of such thought-provoking questions. Nor did it go the other potential direction and provide the audience with some un-PC erotic orientalism which the piece would have also justified. There was distinct lack of elegance or magic about the production and design, which was oppressively earnest in every respect.  If you do want to see a great opera done in English, you could always nip over to Paris where Chistophe Rousset’s version of Handel’s Semele, full of fabulous tunes and a wonderful design, is on next week. The rehearsals suggest a thrilling show. A semi-staged version is on at the Barbican the week after.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/zaide-sadlers-wells,
785,"Rigoletto, Welsh National Opera, Cardiff",Rigoletto,Welsh National Opera,2010-06-26,stephen Walsh,"Watching and hearing this revival of WNO’s now eight-year-old production of Verdi’s Rigoletto, it’s hard to remember he composed it only a year or two before La Traviata, that most psychologically believable of all his operas. In Rigoletto nothing makes sense: the hunchback’s pretty daughter, her apparently willing incarceration, Rigoletto’s hoodwinking (literally) into helping her abduction, her final self-sacrifice – all palpable nonsense. Yet the piece never seriously fails. In a sense it’s music drama at its purest: the plot is an appendage to the music, what Wagner later called “deeds of music made visible”. So you might expect it to work in any setting, as long as the music is properly treated. James Macdonald’s production, revived with a very strong cast under a fine conductor, suggests not.Macdonald and his designer, Robert Innes Hopkins, famously transplant Victor Hugo’s story to Kennedy’s White House – one of those bright after-dinner ideas that too often hit the stage when they should really have gone out with the left-overs. The change adds stupidity to the nonsense. At least in 16th-century Mantua it’s half-plausible that Rigoletto would be disturbed by Monterone’s curse. But in 1963 Washington (in fact November, to judge from the illuminated pumpkin head in Rigoletto’s house)?And who is this Rigoletto anyway? And who are all these ridiculous balding, besuited courtiers, dedicated apparently to nothing except kidnap and rape? One may be a Kennedy agnostic, but surely there are limits. In short, the attempt at veracity merely draws attention to the improbabilities, and – worse – renders them irritating. Luckily, though, WNO base their casting on sounder principles.Rigoletto is an easier work than its other Verdi contemporary Il Trovatore, which according to Caruso needed the four greatest singers in the world in order to be a success; Rigoletto needs only three, though it adds some tricky and subtle supporting roles, like the unforgettable bass part of the contract killer Sparafucile, superbly sung here by the up-and-coming David Soar, and the briefer but not much less important Monterone (Michael Druiett, also impressive).The Duke (President) of course has the juiciest lollipops, and WNO were fortunate to have Shaun Dixon as reserve for the indisposed Gwyn Hughes Jones, singing with complete aplomb and immaculate style, including a few bad habits of your well-versed Italian tenor (not, for example, quite reaching his standard-issue top B at the end of ""La donna è mobile"").  Dixon also has excellent presence and is a better actor than most spaghetti regulars.  The vocal star of this particular show, however, is beyond question the American soprano, Sarah Coburn, whose vulnerable, bobby-soxed Gilda fits the production to a tee, but whose musical command makes no concessions to its brainlessness. Her ""Caro nome"", supported by exquisite flute-playing, should have stopped the show but didn’t, quite, because Verdi (thinking of stage rather than audience values) fades it out at the end, so that only Italians, perhaps, know that you should still cheer such singing to the rafters, if necessary drowning the orchestra. She is also deeply touching in the post-rape scene – ""Tutte le feste"" perfectly balanced in sentiment, controlled in vocal line.By comparison, Simon Keenlyside (pictured above right with the WNO Chorus) is not in my book as one of the angels of the voice, but he uses his slightly colourless timbre to brilliant effect, and at times almost convinces us that the Hunchback (or at least Handicapped) of Capitol Hill is a possible concept. His ""Cortigiani"" rises to an almost frightening grandeur of menace, and he earlier manages the switch from tormentor to tormented as convincingly as one can expect in this context.The conductor is the young Spaniard Pablo Heras-Casado – excellent not least because unobtrusive, attentive to the singers but also moulding orchestral and choral detail with great care. And this company is in fine fettle just now, apparently unjaded by their more spectacular work on Wagner’s Meistersinger.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/rigoletto-welsh-national-opera-cardiff,
786,"Manon, Royal Opera",Manon,Royal Opera,2010-06-23,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"You'd be forgiven for thinking that an opera that - in all seriousness - climaxes to the words, ""Farewell, little table. You seemed so large,"" might need a small, but firm, slap in the face. But you'd be quite wrong. Manon is really quite froth-free. Its operatic brothers-in-arms are Lulu and The Rake's Progress, charting as they all do the rise and tumbling fall of an innocent at the hands of a corrupting city; its allusive musical ways reach out to Debussy and Puccini. The point is, it's a modern work. Add director Laurent Pelly (of La Fille du régiment fame), Anna Netrebko and young Italian hunk, Vittorio Grigolo, to the mix and, far from wanting to slap the opera, you should end up wanting to give this new Royal Opera House production a big kiss.Coursing through the work was one basic idea: the helter-skelter philosophy of the diagonal, of the slide, of the see-saw. Everyone in Manon is rising or falling. It dictates Chantal Thomas's simple, bold set design, which sinks or swells at every turn - down to the banks of the Seine, up to the lovers' suspended garret home, up and down the ramped casino. It dictates the decision to relocate the drama from the reign of Louis XV to the great French capitalist roller-coaster ride that was the Second French Empire.No one is taken on a more vertiginous journey than Manon herself and nothing should be more unpredictable than Manon's handling of these new terrains. And, yet for all Netrebko's attributes, for all her immense skill (her vocal control is better than ever), she just didn't go that extra loony mile that's necessary to really believe in this character's wild fate. She was neither wide-eyed enough in the first act, nor manipulative enough in the second, nor desperate enough in the final two. Inevitably, her diva moment in Act Three came pretty naturally to her. But, as always, where the physical and psychological fail with Netrebko, the voice takes over.The same was largely true of Grigolo's debut as Chevalier, whose fearless singing more than made up for the shortcomings in his acting. It wasn't something I noticed at first. His firecracker Act One entrance, part puppy, part bull, seemed just right for sweeping Manon off her feet. Even the 10 minutes of embraced circling, which should have looked ridiculous, actually followed on naturally from his hurtling energy, like a spinning weather-vane in the wind. But this breathlessness needed to stop, or at least mutate or mature as life dealt its many blows to the relationship. And yet it never did.Beyond the two leads, the cast had depth and strength, particularly in the superb leering and operetta-like singing en pointe from William Shimmell (de Brétigny) and Christopher Mortagne (Guillot), and the stentorian offerings from Christof Fischesser's Comte. The actress trio, Pousette (Simona Mihai), Javotte (Louise Innes) and Rosette (Kai Rüütel), were a French Rhinemaiden-like delight. We had to wait until the duet in the third act for the vocal and amorous touchpaper to be well and truly set alight between the lead couple, a now ordained Grigolo ripping off his vestments for a bit of vestry nooky.Antonio Pappano was equally passionate with the orchestra, ripping into the score, scooping out the colouristic flesh, rolling out the salty seaside swells and plunges, pushing on the almost Wagnerian romantic lapping. Neither Pelly nor Pappano could have made a better case for this piece or the composer, and its importance to the 20th century. The impressionistic third act, a Manet-like combination of the blurred and the razor-sharp, and the expressionistic fourth, The Cabinet of Dr Caligari in feel, was surely emphasising this.It was a shame that the leading couple didn't invest the psychological aspect with as much attention as Pelly and Pappano had done the dramatic and musical. The audience were riotous in their indifference to this point, cheering the leads to the rafters. No metaphorical slapping then from the audience for this opera, and a hell of a lot of love and metaphorical knicker-throwing for Grigolo. We'll no doubt be hearing more from this young Italian. I hope he got home safe.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/manon-royal-opera,
787,"A Midsummer Night's Dream, Garsington",A Midsummer Night's Dream,Garsington,2010-06-21,stephen Walsh,"The beautiful gardens of Garsington Manor might seem an ideal setting for Britten’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, with its ilex groves, its miniature forests of pyramid yew, and its paths overhung (o’er-canopied?) with climbing roses.  So it’s a mild shock to confront on the actual stage what looks like a huge attic store-room littered with beds, chucked in at all angles, a few lamps, various items of bric-à-brac, and, upstage centre, a large C. S. Lewis-style wardrobe through which, in due course, characters enter and exit.Bed admittedly is iconic in the Dream, a work in which half the cast fall asleep at one time or another. In Daniel Slater’s production even Puck starts off in bed and is rousted out by fairies in the shape of a gang of small boys dressed up as soldiers, sailors and pilots. And this is the starting-point for a reading that treats the dream in question as a process of self-discovery, growing-up, emotional maturation. The Athenians themselves are overgrown boys and girls in school uniform, which they gradually shed. Only the presumably immortal Oberon and Tytania, and the mechanicals – for whom self-discovery is sixpence a day for life – are adults (of a kind) from start to finish.The idea is brilliantly effective and would be still more so, I suppose, in a theatre where the light of day could be shut out. At Garsington, with its open-sided, translucent-ceilinged marquee theatre, the nocturnal snorings and slitherings of Britten’s incomparable score are rather demystified by the sunlit purlieus of six o’clock on a June evening. The music, Francis O’Connor’s designs, and especially the lighting by Bruno Poet, all come into their own only after the long interval, ironically as dawn approaches onstage, in a truly magical ending with the lamps lit and the woodland carpets rolled away to create the opera’s one strictly indoor setting (for Theseus’s post-nuptials) and a stage for Pyramus and Thisby.In choreography, too, there is some small loss. At the core of the production, Puck, with his acrobatic trumpet and drum accompaniment, is turned from a glib-talking gymnast into a tongue-tied Beckett tramp, error-prone not because over-hasty but because slow-witted. Richard Durden makes this convincing enough, but it slows things down more generally; and in the same way the fairies, their wings clipped, hover rather than flit, while singing with irresistible charm. Slater best achieves movement with his helter-skelter slide for the more magical entrances stage left (including the conductor’s for his curtain call), and in the Pyramus play and bergamask – impossibly stupid and overplayed as always but fun because a release from the toils of magic.Unorthodox the setting and the action, but the music, in the experienced hands of Steuart Bedford, brings few surprises – agreeable or disagreeable. Though not always quite as fleet as the master’s own performance, it’s very much the score rendered audible, exquisitely played, attentive to stage and singers. This latter can be very necessary, not least because of Britten’s vocal predilections. Rebecca Bottone’s Tytania – bright and toppy – can ride anything in the pit, but the countertenor Oberon, James Laing, is less forward, though a stylish, intelligent performer, and unexpectedly moving when he assumes a Christ-like concern for mortal agony after the last of Puck’s bunglings. The poor manipulated lovers are a well-balanced team, wittily directed, and without undue slapstick. For Britten, perhaps significantly, the soprano was the sexually assertive Helena, sparklingly sung here by the girlish Katherine Manley, the mezzo the more stable Hermia, here Anna Stéphany – contained and dependable, exactly right. Their oft-confused squires, Andrew Staples (Lysander) and George von Bergen (Demetrius) are likewise excellent. The mechanicals, as ever, test the director’s inventive powers.  I like very much Jonathan Best’s studious, besuited Quince, the petite Pascal Charbonneau as Flute (and a worryingly attractive Thisby), and the utterly un-petite Sion Goronwy as Snug. They are well supported by Mark Wilde and Robert Gildon. But by some way the star of the show is Neal Davies’s Bottom, more bank manager than weaver, vocally authoritative, consistently funny however ghastly the jokes.By comparison Conal Coad’s Theseus and Patricia Orr’s Hippolyta are a disappointment, partly because mildly satirised, at that point in the story when sanity should speak. This Theseus is a stout and elderly admiral, the apotheosis, perhaps, of the grown-up, and questionable in his motives. Hippolyta, for her part, is clearly marrying him for what he’ll leave her.It may be, though, that sanity is always suspect in this charmed world, if not, one hopes, in the equally magical environment of Garsington itself, on show here, sadly, for the last time before next year’s move to Wormsley.  The company need three million to keep afloat. Like the mechanicals, they deserve it.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/midsummer-nights-dream-garsington,
788,"Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, Welsh National Opera, Cardiff",Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg,Welsh National Opera,2010-06-20,David Nice,"Only those who think the burnt-out question of Wagner and the Nazis can still be brought to bear on his operas could be disappointed by Richard Jones's life-enhancing new production. Not a swastika in sight, not a hint of anti-semitic caricature for the fallguy who was never intended for it in the first place, only affirmation of the opera's central message that great art can bring order and understanding to society.It launches with a masterstroke: a dropcloth collage portraying German-speaking genius from Bach and Mozart to Pina Bausch and Michael Haneke, embracing all creeds and persuasions among those whose work outlives the chaos that threatened it. It's only at the end that the central, historical figure of Hans Sachs, the opera's cobbler-philosopher hero, joins the portraits. Holding him aloft is his embodiment, Bryn Terfel, the Welsh bass-baritone who especially after this, his most daunting achievement to date, should join any British pantheon of greats.Jones's view of a Nuremberg that veers wittily between 16th-century pomp, 19th-century bourgeois dress and a dash of the later artistic Germany - a photo of Lotte Lenya and Kurt Weill is propped up on the cobbler's bookcase - is not without its inner demons. Its heart of darkness is located, tellingly, in Sachs himself. Perhaps it takes a singer who has also brought us a definitive Sweeney Todd to embrace the murk as well as the humanity. Terfel really does look like a master who thrashes his apprentices in a bad mood. And it doesn't get much worse than the slough of despond into which the violent folly of St John's Eve casts him: Jones has the curtain rise on a seriously depressed Sachs with the first notes of the deeply melancholy Act Three Prelude, and we see him bolting for freedom, like the young lovers tried to do before him, only to return to bring order to the day of a great song contest.He's the embodiment, then, of the opera's later message that nothing can happen, or be created, without a touch of Wahn, that untranslatable key word which can be rendered as ""madness"" or ""illusion"". Terfel's warm, never over-forced timbre embraces both masculine weight and feminine sensitivity, and as we've long known, he's the ultimate embodiment of stage charisma. No one takes their eyes off this Sachs, his physical presence emphasised by the way Jones brings him so close to his relatively diminutive fellow leads. If Sachs is the noblest, most reflective character in any opera, then that means that anyone who can master his essence will be giving the performance of a lifetime. I saw one, way back in the 1980s, from the lovable Norman Bailey, which I never thought to see equalled. Bryn did just that, in his own very different way. He too was born to play the part; he's made it his own; take your pick of the clichés, and any one will be true.Where to begin with how Wagner weaves in the demands of an art that must respect tradition but learn also to embrace the new with the slowly emerging love-triangle that gave Strauss and Hofmannsthal the cue for the drama of ageing in Der Rosenkavalier? All I can promise you is that Jones tells the story and brings out its tangled relationships as well as its artistic debates with exemplary clarity. There's not even a problem with the early, dramatically sticky passage in which apprentice David (Andrew Tortise, a suitably truculent and whimsical adolescent if at times in need of a bit more vocal support for his lightish tenor) instructs outsider knight Walter (Raymond Very, pictured above right with Terfel) in the rules of song as the mastersingers dictate it so that Walter can win the young girl he's fallen in love with. All the song-types, related in pedantic if orchestrally delicious detail, get pointed out on the wardrobes wheeled around by the other apprentices, who accomplish their multiple tasks with disciplined aplomb and manage to sing spiritedly at the same time.Paul Steinberg's bare set for the church which must become the song school is transformed before our very eyes both through what's in the wardrobes and a series of portraits of latter-day Welsh worthies dressed up in the same Renaissance garb. Sachs stands out immediately by gently brushing the costume aside, unlike his fellow Mastersingers; already we learn that he's both part of the group and prepared to resist it if he thinks it needs putting to the test. There's a symmetry in Act Three where it's the townsfolk who get to wear Buki Schiff's fantastical pageant-costumes and the masters who appear in everyday smart suits to people the bare green framework of the stage.It's not until Act Two that Wagner lets us see to the heart of more personal relationships. Amanda Roocroft's vivaciously acted Eva, vocally stretched to the limit only when Wagner finally wants her to be an impassioned woman rather than a sweet girl, is credible from the start. She's seen as capable of teasing her goldsmith father (Brindley Sherratt, noble and intelligent of phrase in his long Act One narrative), but less so Sachs, the much older man who's played such a part in her life and with whom, in this production, she's clearly in love (Roocroft and Terfel pictured above). The problem we have to see borne out is that she's now blitzed by a deeper, more troubling infatuation with young Walter - despite his nobility, a mini-Sachs in Act Three when the two men sit side by side in their shirts and braces with their matching beards and long hair. Very looks right, which is more than I can say for any other Walter I've seen, but for the near-impossible ideal you want someone who's charismatic, impetuous and who really takes the palm with golden singing at the competition. The American tenor didn't achieve that, but curiously when Walter's working out his prize song in Sachs's workshop, a memory lapse threw him and suddenly, when he stopped thinking too hard about what he was doing, the vocal production eased up - but only then. Still, he got through this killer role, which is worth a prize in itself.There's a masterclass in comic timing, as ever, from Christopher Purves as the pedantic Beckmesser: first elegantly malevolent as he fingers the chalks to mark the newcomer's performance in Act One, then desperately unpleasant and finally preeningly foolish as he tries to sing the song stolen from his assumed rival. We don't need to feel sorry for his come-uppance: Jones and Terfel between them make much of Sachs's remark that everyone has moments of weakness, but some learn from their mistakes and others like Beckmesser crash on through the red lights.Though this characterisation is merely a slightly more realistic than usual rendering of the expected comedy of discomfiture, a straight line that's taken over the four hours plus of the drama as a whole, Jones's imagination surfaces in sudden, telling and often tear-inducing moments. His two most typical thumbprints are the phantom procession of markers with crosses on their box heads which Walter conjures in his night-time brain-fever, and the Seventh Seal, Brother Death-like figure of the night watchman (David Soar, a promising young bass), bearing a lantern in place of a scythe. There's also a Jonesian caper when David thrashes Beckmesser for wooing his Magdalene (Anna Burford, smiling charm throughout), who's disguised as her mistress - a chase around the houses in which Beckmesser eventually loses his trousers. The night brawl as a whole is relatively tame, maybe to make sure that the splendid WNO Chorus keep in time with the conductor (they did on the first night).Other touches are humane and intelligent. When Sachs tells Walter he'll help him to interpret his dream - a passage of which Freud undoubtedly took note - the young man lies on the couch while the cobbler sits at the table behind him writing it all down. The finished sheets are hung up to dry, and the characters all look up at them in wonder just as in the first act the assembled burghers all looked up at their rather more rigid rules for mastersinging. On the first night, I wasn't sure if these green panels were working as intended, and the usually reliable lighting of Mimi Jordan Sherin was playing up rather a lot, especially at the end of the First Act and in a quintet where I couldn't believe that four of the five characters were supposed to be left in the dark. These are the kind of teething problems that such a massive undertaking as the staging of a Wagner opera is bound to throw up, and the sometimes tricksy Wales Millennium Centre doesn't always make things any easier, so no doubt things will have settled by the time the show hits Birmingham.I haven't even so much as mentioned the bedrock of this towering company show, WNO music director Lothar Koenigs's natural grasp of the score's rich ebb and flow. Transparent and buoyant from the first in a Prelude that inspires total confidence, he brings the carolling woodwind voices of spring and youth to the fore, lets the orchestra billow in the big emotional climaxes and never overdoes the pomp and ceremony. So the final celebrations in the Nuremberg meadow underpin deliciously Lucy Burge's choreographed rituals and dances and never come close to bluster - crucial when we get to the sticking point of Sachs's final address to ""holy German art"". Whatever that might have meant to the unruly German states of the 16th century, or for the still dubious German identity of the 1860s, Jones makes clear what it means to him: a universe of German-speaking genius across the centuries. So, yes, the portraits from the dropcloth come back, as we thought they would, but couldn't work out how. As Sachs delivers his keynote speech, the townsfolk one by one hold up their portraits of composers, artists, performing musicians, actors, filmmakers. There couldn't be a more wonderful, euphoric or moving way of expressing what Meistersinger means to us today.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/die-meistersinger-von-n%C3%BCrnberg-welsh-national-opera-cardiff,

791,"Macbeth, Glyndebourne",Macbeth,Glyndebourne,2010-06-18,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"Shakespeare's Macbeth is full of fleetingly funny moments. Halfway through the regicidal Second Act, we stumble upon a castle porter gibbering on about the bodily consequences of drink - ""nose-painting, sleep and urine"". Verdi's opera mostly shuns these vignettes for the bigger, more concentratedly darker picture. The music works itself up into an ornamented mania and for the most part broods on low orchestral colourings. There is nothing funny about a single second of it. Why Richard Jones has therefore decided to send the whole thing up for Glyndebourne in a series of dumb gags is completely baffling and rather irritating.The first gag is the set itself (designer, Ultz): a psychedelic castle of white bricks and blue mortar, empty but for a makeshift, tartan hut on the side, where the King seems to enjoy hanging out. There's scaffolding at the back (don't ask why), which the choruses march up once or twice in the first half. Things proceed in a slow, flat, nothingy way (original choreographer Linda Dobell, revival, Sarah Fahie), as marauding hordes of axe-wielding Scots, kilted, T-shirt-ed, cumberland booted, charge from one side to the other and back. Lady Macbeth is dressed up as an air hostess, Macbeth in a T-shirt and kilt. Questions of motive, identity and place are left hanging. The only logic running through the production was the logic of the one-liner. Which would have been fine if they had been any good. Which they were not.Jones almost gets to some comedic nugget of truth in the portrayal of the three witch choruses: one made up of Myra Hindley clones, one resembling that piggy headscarved lady from The League of Gentlemen and one lot resembling a 1980s Vicky Pollard. A nice creepiness was conjured up - particularly in the eminently weird, small-stepped, blue puffer-vested, Seventies-jumpered, sulking Hindley creation - but this soon runs out of steam as Jones resorts to cliché.None of it was helped by a revival cast of singers of a singularly uncharismatic sort. They could all more or less sing the notes cleanly and correctly but with so little emotional involvement that one wondered if they too had issues getting their head around this uninspiring production. Andrzej Dobber was mostly absent in character as Macbeth. Stanislav Shvets (Banquo) had a lovely tone but ragged technique. I wouldn't really have cared what the voice of Lady Macbeth (Erika Sunnegårdh) had been like if she had managed an even half decent attempt at capturing a Lady-Macbethian spirit. But, though the music kept offering her the perfectly deranged springboards from which to leap, she wasn't having any of it. She played it safe and, in terms of entries, often very late. Yonghoon Lee (Macduff) was received well by the audience but smelled of ham to me. Only from conductor Vasily Petrenko's hands in the pit were we getting any real musicality.I always thought I rather enjoy the free-wheeling, surreal side to Richard Jones, but actually I probably respect his engagement with realism far more. And when he is forced to do this in Macbeth (because the music won't let him play silly buggers any more), he hits the emotional bullseye. Real feelings suddenly broke out with his plain, honest presentation of the chorus, ""Patria oppressa"" (""Our oppressed homeland""), a statement of universal and specific wartime grief. And the realism of Banquo's murder (a superb Coen brothers-like jobbie) and Lady Macbeth's self-sufffocation by orange laundry bag showed what could have been if only Jones hadn't been so lazy and arrogant as to think that the work could be reduced to a string of cheap jokes.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/macbeth-glyndebourne,

Gareth would like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony, but what if there aren't any harmonies or hooks or indeed any kind of musical handrail? Well, the bar goes a little bit higher. No wonder Gareth kept telling us how terrified he was in the first episode of Gareth Goes to Glyndebourne.If you've seen The Choir, the mise en scène is superficially a case of as you were. Gareth goes scouting for talent in the sink estates, and deploys his unthreatening brand of charisma and empathy to coax them towards self-belief, with possibly a spot of civility thrown in. As ever Gareth does his completely engaging thing: part speccy teen, part tweeded young fogey, he is disarmingly enthusiastic, ever trusting and never confrontational. You can set your watch by the moment you have to switch on the windscreen wipers.But the difference is that this time the kids have got to be more than all right. They’ve actually got to be able to sing. And act. And move in complex choreographic shapes for the entire length of an operatic performance of a work not notably burdened with what any of them would have recognised as music. Plus it’s all happening at Glyndebourne, the very innermost sanctum of the citadel of privilege, elitism, poshness, cummerbunds, tiaras, Aston Martins - you name it, they've got all the symbols of the old order mustering on a few square yards of nail-clippered picnicking lawns. On a sunny evening, Gareth donned his dicky bow and squired his lovely wife there, just to give us all a whiff of the world of hyper-wealth his new ensemble would be infiltrating.  You can see what’s in it for Glyndebourne. They get three hours of prime rebranding on national television. But what’s in it for the choral recruits is the real story. The opera is Knight Crew, based on the novelist Nicky Singer's inner-city update of the Arthurian legend. Gareth’s job was to find and train a 50-strong chorus. Last night was largely about schlepping around schools and scary youth clubs, looking for volunteers.  A lot of it looked like genuinely thankless work. In one club a gang of ne’er-do-wells ornamentally blanketed in tats and piercings, hair hardened into aggressive attitudes, all pretty much turned their back on Gareth when he asked if they liked singing. Even the TV camera held no interest for them. One charming young gentleman refused to audition with a Jacko song on the grounds of what he gets up to (more correctly got up to; even more correctly, didn’t actually get up to, according to the Californian courts) with children. In due course Gareth managed to lure hundreds to a series of workshops, whittling them down slowly from 200 to 100, who all had to sing the first line of “Over the Rainbow” to a judging panel. The words movingly attested to the wishful nature of the project. You can object to the familiar trickery, the strict adherence to grammatical tramlines. You can tire of television’s ceaseless desire to codify class distinctions. You can object, if that way inclined, to the music by Julian Philips. But Gareth Goes to Glyndebourne feels like a charming experiment in cultural engineering. Opera gets a leg-up. So do some less lucky children in Sussex. And we all get to enjoy a warm glow that feels only minimally like the product of manipulation.Watch a performance from The Choir  ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/gareth-goes-glyndebourne-bbc-two,
793,"The Love for Three Oranges, Grange Park Opera",The Love for Three Oranges,Grange Park Opera,2010-06-17,stephen Walsh,"“Art and love, these have been my life,” sings Tosca in Puccini’s opera. “Music or words first?” the Countess worries in Strauss’s Capriccio. Now in the third of Grange Park’s operas this summer we have the warring advocates of tragedy, comedy, melodrama and farce in Prokofiev’s Love for Three Oranges. Could it be guilt at its own idle detachment that draws country-house opera into the agony of self-reflective theatre? Well, Tosca is barely self-reflective – an excuse for a big aria and an off-stage cantata. But Prokofiev’s Oranges – like that other, and better, Strauss concoction, Ariadne auf Naxos – derives both humour and instruction from our lurking fear that all these stage passions, triumphs and disasters are mere trickery and greasepaint. And it does so in music that vibrates with energy and sardonic wit from first bar to last, music strictly devoid of serious agony.The opera, like its source Gozzi play, is a spoof fairytale. A prince dying of melancholia finds nothing amusing except the sight of the evil fairy Fata Morgana flat on her back, for which indiscretion she condemns him to fall in love with three oranges. The oranges, when found, turn out to house three beautiful princesses, two of whom at once die of thirst, while the third is saved only by a bucket of water provided by the so-called Eccentrics in the audience (roughly, the untroubled theatre-lovers): and so on. The nuances come thick and fast. Yet, as in any good pantomime, narrative logic is never quite sacrificed to magical intervention; it’s merely speeded up by it. And speed is a strong feature of David Fielding’s production at the Grange: speed in the sense of stage choreography, and in the sense of quick-witted integration of hybrid elements. Fielding does his own designs, and their eclecticism fits the spirit of the score exactly; in fact a lot of the visual jokes are already in the stage directions. Some directorial clichés, like the inevitable cloned bearded doctors with stethoscopes, are after all justified by the story. Other modernisms, the princesses’ giant orange-juice cartons (“two for the price of three” – why not three for the price of two, by the way?), or the Dr Who phone box that whisks the Prince away to the wicked Creonta’s kitchen, are bang on the Prokofiev nail, if beyond his ken. The magic flashes and fizzes in the best pantomime tradition, and the fake audience groups are brilliantly organised, as well as sparklingly sung, on and off stage, not least in the set pieces – like the famous march and scherzo – which ultimately suggest Prokofiev was more at home in ballet than opera, for all the deftness of this particular specimen.Musically there is a strong performance waiting in the wings here. The cast is too big to itemise, but Clive Bayley’s King of Clubs, Jeffrey Lloyd-Robert’s Prince, and Wynne Evans’s Truffaldino shouldn’t go unmentioned. Of three very nubile princesses, the survivor, Rosie Bell, hits off the delicious absurdity of the situation to a tee. Vuyani Mlinde’s top-hatted magician Tchelio and Rebecca Cooper’s tall, sexy Fata Morgana are a perfectly matched pair – an illusionist and his assistant gone to the bad. All clever, well-observed, well-sung portraits.Leo Hussain, a young conductor I haven’t encountered before, is well on top of the score, without quite holding the lid on its volume, which sometimes makes life hard for his singers. But what’s hardest of all for them is the inexplicable decision to sing the opera in (rather bad) French, a language that has no relevance to either the work or its audience. Sure, it was premiered in French in Chicago; but that was for local reasons. This is a Russian opera, a comedy to boot, and the only sane language to sing it in in England is English. The audience might then manage to laugh in the right places, and much, much more often; because as well as being musically a treasure, The Love for Three Oranges is, or should be, very, very funny.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/love-three-oranges-grange-park-opera,

Lady Ottoline, chateleine of the enchanted garden, would writhe as eastern sorceress Armida, though Lytton and co would hardly make a very butch bunch of opposing crusaders. To be honest, there wasn't much more testosterone or sex on show in Rossini's dramatically flimsy, musically elaborate operatic nod to Tasso last night, and the gaudy onstage attempt at a garden of delights couldn't compare with the real thing. But it's something at least to field four light Rossini tenors, albeit of varying ability, and with Jessica Pratt's phenomenal final scene, a star was born.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/armida-garsington-opera,
795,"Le nozze di Figaro, Garsington Opera",Le nozze di Figaro,Garsington Opera,2010-06-06,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"The sun rode high, the gardens glowed green, my lemon berry pudding bulged proudly and, on stage, the familiar 24-carat farce that is Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro was working itself out to perfection. It was Garsington - and my baking - at its very finest, a fittingly triumphant opening to the final season at Garsington Manor (they move down the road to Wormsley Estate next year). Sets, direction, singing - two young standouts in particular - all had a part to play, as did the conducting of Douglas Boyd. The country house conductor (an unsung role) has the singular task of somehow warding off the inevitable, scientifically inescapable consequences of a beating sun and a vat of wine on an ageing audience - namely, the catnap. Boyd proved himself the catnap-vanquisher par excellence.Musical excitement came not just in the exercise of dynamic muscle and speed - underpinned by strong beats and secure corners. It came also with the squeezing of every drop of dramatic colour and narrative interest from this extraordinary score. Boyd's attention to detail, inner voicing, tremolo colour and musical phrasing - that was at times so buxom in its peaks as to compete for attention with our curvaceous young Susanna, Sophie Bevan - meant the musical evening never flagged. All of which attention to instrumental finery had its impact on the orchestra, who played out of their skins.On stage, there was far less re-inventive flash. John Cox's production could just as well have been a revival from 1805 as 2005, such was its dogged wigs-'n'-breeches line of thought. Not that any of this mattered to any of us in the audience; it did what many more daring productions fail to do, namely, elucidate the story. Le nozze is a Feydeau-like play, where assignations and accidents set off jack-in-the-box denouements in each act. The mechanics need to be oiled properly, set off efficiently and allowed to run their course unimpeded, with only the slightest and subtlest of guidance, and Cox knows it. With the help of Robert Perdziola's clever, efficient sets - whose angles and corridors and Lego-like action drew applause every time they changed their configuration - and the real gardens coming into play in the Act Two ""who-fell-into-the-garden"" japery, everything - comedy, tension, denouement- unfolded like clockwork.The real rise in temperature, however, the two teaspoons of baking powder in this golden operatic sponge, let's say, came from two young singers: Bevan and Anna Grevelius (Cherubino). Grevelius made the first big impression by leaping head-first into her breathless opening aria. Her tone was sweet, windy, air-borne, full of a deliberate nervous energy; it's what one imagines a young Mary Garden might have sounded like in her day. Bevan was even more extraordinary as Susanna, filling this character's many roles (accomplice, wronged lover, mothering-figure, flirt) with exceptional ease. Her solo stints were as stunning as her ornamented contributions to ensemble.Next to these two fresh daisies, Kishani Jayasinghe's thick, creamy voice, which always hung back from the beat for extra emotional attention, was less interesting. Her musical instinct and dynamic urge never quite made as much sense as the others. James Oldfield's cerebral, brooding Figaro was finely - perhaps too finely - drawn. Grant Doyle's hairy-chested Count was nicely poised between the greaseball and the cad. Conal Coad's Doctor Bartolo delivered some lovely low sounds, full and clean, through passages of pianissimo and forte. Daniel Norman (Don Basilio) was more engaging when in full flow than when attempting to wring comedic effect from the recitative. But the sun-kissed evening belonged to the two girls, Bevan and Grevelius, both of whom should hit the big time pretty damn soon.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/le-nozze-di-figaro-garsington-opera,

800,"The Pearl Fishers, English National Opera",The Pearl Fishers,English National Opera,2010-06-02,David Nice,"To both paraphrase and contradict one of the many French critics who savaged young Bizet, his first stage work of genius mentions no fishers in its gawky libretto but offers strings of pearls in the music. That's to say, much more than the famous duet, the least moving number on offer last night. I’ve come to love this fitfully ravishing score’s gentle, intimate side but had given up on seeing a less than tawdry staging to solve the opera’s gimcrack orientalia. Yet here, with director Penny Woolcock steering a sensitive course between the devil of pure kitsch and the deep blue sea of over-earnest reinterpretation, much meaningful acting meshed with supple conducting and there was one vocal performance of show-stopping quality.Bizet's librettists, Cormon and Carré, didn't really know, or probably much care, where they were: pearl fishers, or rather divers, Nadir and Zurga invoke the Buddhist temple in Kandy, Sri Lanka, in the context of hymns to Hindu god Brahma. The exotic setting, to mix clichés in the French so woefully lacking from Martin Fitzpatrick's archaic-sounding English translation, is more a question of mise en scène than raison d'être. So alarm bells might have rung when Woolcock in the advance blurb linked the force of the sea with climate change. Both she and ENO had to be trusted, though: her production of Adams's Doctor Atomic, shuttling between the New York Met and the London Coliseum, provided the kind of unforgettable images with which the company has been forging a new identity over the past couple of seasons.  Sure enough, from the opening image of divers plunging to gather pearls from the sea bed (pictured right) against the placid strains of Bizet's introduction, the look of Dick Bird's set designs as complemented by Jennifer Shriever's lighting is well in line with ENO's current visual crest of a wave. Woolcock locates the action in a present-day shanty-town community by the sea, complete with a couple of snap-happy tourists; but given the Hindu sense of beauty and colour in worship and clothing - realistically realised by Kevin Pollard's costumes - it's no earnest, miserabilist affair. Nor are the people happy, smiling natives: mob violence can erupt at the flick of an unholy switch. Incisive choral work and rising-star conductor Rory Macdonald's careful balancing act in the pit made sure that Bizet's least characteristic, grand-opera mode was almost as convincing as the rest.  What many of us love the work for, though, is its abundance of intimate lyric gestures, voices entwined with many exquisite orchestral solos (horns and flute very much in the limelight). Alfie Boe's light, bright tenor is under too much premature pressure to forge the long, arching lines we need to crown the duet - and the Coli really isn't the house for him - but he charms in his Act One reverie. As, even more so, does Hanan Alattar in her Act Two counterpart. The lyric soprano voice, perhaps, is too open and not as alluring as predecessors Valerie Masterson and Mary Plazas, but she uses it with impeccable musicianship and looks every inch the part for perhaps the first time in the opera's performing history. Here's a great example of production working imaginatively with voice and orchestra: as Leila sings of the lover she can't forget, a giant Alfie Boe swims wraith-like in huge video projections (excellent work, as in the company's earlier marine excursion Riders to the Sea, by Fifty-Nine Productions).  The vocal palm, though, goes to revelation of the season so far, Hawaiian baritone Quinn Kelsey (pictured with Hanan Alattar's Leila left) as the friend faced with the dilemma of whether to punish his beloved Nadir's sacrilegious pursuit of the priestess they both love. His Verdian sound is full and rich from ringing top to resonant bottom, the expressive use of the hoary text moving to tears. What follows his meltingly beautiful aria in Bizet's Act Three shows Woolcock working superbly with the duet form: Alattar's Leila begins with pious Hindu supplications, again taken from the life, but ends up defiant of the  big man's violence. It only reinforces that Bizet's essential drama is the usual conventional operatic love triangle, try as Woolcock may to show us the tragic results of the village-burning with which Zurga allows the lovers to effect their getaway. She helps her three main soloists with plenty of front-of-stage delivery, though there's no denying that the piece would work even better in a smaller theatre like Glyndebourne, which could have spearheaded a French lyric revival. Still, I wouldn't mind seeing what Woolcock could make of Lakmé at ENO. The soaring ideas of Bizet and Delibes are too strong to be sunk by plots that turn out to be far from unworkable.

802,"Stephen Fry on Wagner, BBC Four",Stephen Fry on Wagner,BBC Four,2010-05-26,Jasper Rees,"Is there anywhere Stephen Fry will not go? I mean in documentaries. We’ve had Fry on depression and Fry on America, Fry on HIV and Fry on endangered species. Movingly, we’ve had Fry on who he thinks he is, an odyssey in which he discovered that much of his family fetched up in the gas ovens. Fry on Wagner? Admit it, you weren’t surprised. You didn't think, not another bloody comedian investigating, in pursuit of ratings, a subject of which he knows next to nothing. Fry, as everyone knows, knows everything. “My love affair with Wagner”, he began, “began when I was a child.” Of course it did, Stephen.The thrust of this instalment of BBC Four’s Opera season was to introduce Wagner to newcomers. Fry was of course the perfect choice for this sort of work, as he has long been positioned as elitism’s best apologist. People will take a lecture on Der Ring des Nibelungen from the voice of the Harry Potter audiobooks. There was even an echo of Rowlingsland here. When a picture of Wagner’s most infamous fan appeared on screen, Fry referred to the Fuhrer merely as “Him”, much as in Hogwarts they call you know who ""You Know Who"".Since Who Do You Think You Are? Fry has been in touch with his Jewishness - or at least in touch in public, which is where the nation’s Tweeter-in-Chief mostly seems to live. So in this tour of the Wagnerian horizon there were the expected trips to Bayreuth and (pictured below) Mad King Ludwig's folly Schloss Neuschwanstein (no mention of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, for some reason). The film followed Wagner to St Petersburg. But there was a visit to Nuremberg too, where it was argued that Nazi rallies derived their aesthetic, all banners and massed civic marches, from Die Meistersinger. Fry quietly refused to do the tourist thing of standing on the podium where Hitler frothed and foamed to the serried multitudes. In London he also went to meet Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, who as a child had survived Auschwitz because she could play the cello. Fearing the worst, his hope was to quash a rumour that the Jewish ensemble in the camp had been forced to play Wagner as the chimneys belched their evil smoke. She confirmed that they hadn't, if only because the music requires too many musicians.The child in Fry who fell in love with Tannhaüser was much to the fore. Licensed in Bayreuth to drop in on a rehearsal of plump peroxide Valkyries in black leggings, there was wide-eyed schoolboyish excitement. “Fabulous,” he said quite a lot, plus “wow” and “this is amazing”.He managed to score an interview with Wagner’s great-granddaughter Eva, co-chateleine of the annual Festival. When he asked her a clever-clever question - something convoluted about posterity - she looked at him doubtfully and said, “I think you create something in your mind which is perhaps not.” Has our great national treasure ever been bitch-slapped with such elegant Teutonic precision? Then she remembered she had something more important to do in the office and scarpered. All rather hilarious. Fry didn’t mind this public brush-off one bit. “Flesh on flesh I touched a Wagner,” he confided softly. “That’s pathetic of me, but it’s rather wonderful.”It’s a function of Fry’s supreme intellectualism that he’s forever half-sweeping it under the carpet, like a tall man who stoops to blend in.  “I know it sounds pretentious and embarrassing,” he said as he put some hi-falutin notion to Lasker-Wallfisch. With an expert on Wagner and the Nazis, he voiced a fantasy he described as “pathetic” and therefore “very me”: that he’d like to go back in history and make clear to Wagner that the Jew-hating thing would destroy his legacy, so why not just drop it? (This is not a new thought in Fry, by the way. His novel Making History explores the consequences of going back in time and ensuring Hitler is never even conceived.)Fry’s passion crystallised most clearly when sitting at Wagner’s Steinway, where he played the so-called Tristan chord – “the cluster of notes”, he explained, “which opened the door to modern music.” A pianist rattled off bits of the Prelude and then the Liebestod to illustrate just how long it takes for that moment of dissonance finally to resolve itself. “You’ve made me the happiest man in Germany,” Fry told him afterwards. It was almost as if he’d enjoyed a tantrically postponed climax. “There’s nothing to say,” replied the pianist, more or less torching a post-coital cigarette. “No, that’s exactly the point,” agreed Fry. The pianist brooded for a moment like a bloke reaching for the poetical mot juste to sum up a tumultuous shag. “It’s extremely good music,” he concluded. They laughed happily.And that was Fry’s conclusion: that Wagner’s extremely good music, effulgent with passion and beauty and power, is a force for good, that for all the stain of association with genocide it remains fundamentally ""on the side of the angels"". For those who know their Wagner, there was nothing new here. For the rest of us, it was good work.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/stephen-fry-wagner-bbc-four,
803,"Opera Italia, BBC Four",Opera Italia,BBC Four,2010-05-25,David Nice,"The backlash begins here with the first of Flavia Rittner's three documentaries: not an operatic wannabe or a gushing celebrity outsider to present, only a conductor who knows and loves his job inside out and a parade of gorgeous, energetic singers all at the very top of their hard-working game in state-of-the-art productions.It was a tall order for irresistible Royal Opera music director Antonio Pappano to whizz his way through Monteverdi, Handel, Mozart and Rossini in one hour, but by going straight to the heart of each matter, choosing a scene from a key opera and working on it in the most engaging way possible, he has delighted even us know-alls.Only a man who commands so much respect in the profession would be allowed to introduce so many of those foreign words which usually scare media supremos (even on Radio Three at one stage we were forbidden to use Italian musical terms). Recitativo, da capo, coloratura, opera seria, opera buffa: Pappano defines them all on the hoof, usually as he sits at the piano or the harpsichord playing and singing with immense elan. So let's add another not too alien word to the vocabulary: vivacità. It informs the way he romps through Rossini set pieces with the Figaro of Pietro Spagnoli and the no less exuberant Joyce DiDonato's Rosina, his strolls through Italian cities where BBC cameramen let the light work its magic and an especially delightful lunch the day after a show in Pesaro with the Rossini tenor ne plus ultra Juan Diego Florez. These singers aren't faking a luvviness with Pappano: they know how hard he works, and they genuinely adore him.  Setting up the origins of Italian opera as an intellectual revival of sung Greek tragedy when the punters are wanting their Verdi and Puccini - to follow in two more programmes - was never going to be easy, but it's done with the same brio. It was clever to focus on a period performance of Monteverdi's L'Orfeo before setting before the viewer, and without comment, a sequence of updated productions to ravish the eye as well as the ear. They're all excerpted from unmissable DVDs of the complete operas in question, but this isn't lazy TV: Pappano gets sexy communicator Danielle de Niese into the rehearsal room with peerless mezzo Sarah Connolly to sing and talk about Roman courtesan Poppea's boobs as they go through two scenes from Monteverdi's last masterpiece.  Only connect: De Niese and Connolly star in David McVicar's award-winning production of Handel's Giulio Cesare, so here's the perfect opportunity for Pappano to take us through the three sections of the da capo aria, with Connolly's ferocious Caesar unleashing extra venom in an even more florid repeat. Handel? Mozart? Italian opera? Of course. Pappano confirms Mozart's impeccable sense of the melodies inherent in the language as we zoom on to McVicar's Covent Garden Marriage of Figaro, which Pappano directed so unforgettably from the harpsichord. Here are more good-lookers, Erwin Schrott and Miah Persson, to put across the naturalness of a feisty love match (our conductor-pianist begins to take us through the three main orchestral lines of the opening duet and again, amazingly, TV lets him go on). Then we learn most of what we need to know about the art of the ensemble in a whistlestop tour of the Act Two finale.  The Barber of Seville grand finale is irresistible, too - stemming from an evening of pure delight streamed live across the UK (Royal Opera production pictured right). What better introduction to comic opera than Patrice Caurier and Moshe Leiser's Day-Glo production? Could anyone charm the pants off a first-timer better than Florez and DiDonato? And that's without more than a glimpse here of Alessandro Corbelli's consummate Bartolo and Ferrucio Furlanetto's Don Basilio. Pappano doesn't need the handful of experts - and ""experts"" - wheeled out to tell him what he already knows and add supposed gravitas to the proceedings. It's quite enough to have the contributions of the directors, the singers and their energetic renaissance man, largo al factotum, call him what you will.

807,"Rusalka, Opera North",Rusalka,Opera North,2010-05-22,graham Rickson,"A thousand miles away from the Disney version, the transformation scene in Dvořák’s Rusalka is bleak and terrifying. With not a cauldron, bat or cobweb to be seen, the heroine is strapped to an operating table before imbibing the witch’s magic potion intravenously. Then her legs, until now swaddled together, are literally torn apart. It’s a brutal, shocking moment; no surprise that some audience members giggled nervously. Opera North have revived Olivia Fuchs’s 2003 production with the superb Giselle Allen reprising the title role and it still packs a punch; the staging successfully transcends the work’s longueurs through good acting, simple, stark set design and idiomatic musical direction.First performed in Prague in 1901, Jaroslav Kvapil’s libretto is a fairytale heavily indebted to Hans Christian Andersen’s The Little Mermaid. Water nymph Rusalka falls in love with a prince and goes to see Ježiba the witch, who can make her human if she agrees to sacrifice her voice. Another condition is that Rusalka will become cursed to spend eternity between earth and water if her love is rejected. Naturally, her relationship with the Prince does not go to plan and as he begins to be attracted to a glamorous foreign princess, Rusalka’s plans unravel tragically.Dvořák’s score is a thing of wonder, its bohemian folksiness offset with moments of post-Wagnerian harmonic daring. Rusalka’s desperate urge to experience love as a human is so longingly, vividly expressed that we worry about her losing her innocence, and the dark, chromatic wind writing during the scenes with Ježiba suggests that Dvořák knew what the subtext was. A fundamental plot problem is that we now have a central character in an opera who is effectively mute, but Dvořák is able to cannily bend the rules later on in the work.Giselle Allen looks perfect in the role, and during the scenes when she is silent her careful physicality beautifully suggests desire. The closing moments in Act One, where Richard Berkeley-Steele’s Prince meets Rusalka and whisks her off to his palace, are gloriously heartbreaking: we expect a full-blooded love duet but only hear one voice. There’s fun to be had in contrasting Allen’s physical demeanour with that of the guests and courtiers in the Act Two palace scenes, their stiffly choreographed dance movements contrasting with Rusalka’s natural joy at being able to use her legs for the first time. Niki Turner’s design adds to the chilly formal aura through the use of several large blocks of ice.The supporting cast are excellent, with Richard Angas conveying resignation, pain and sorrow as Rusalka’s father, and Anne-Marie Owens an appropriately sinister witch, all lab-coated officiousness. Oliver von Dohnányi conducts with affection and skill; every tiny pause, every touch of rubato sounding completely natural. Maybe the orchestra enjoy themselves a little too much during Dvořák’s heavier tuttis, but the sound is completely right for the work. And the harp and woodwind accompaniment during the opera’s one hit, ""The Song to the Moon"", is ravishing.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/rusalka-opera-north,

It's the singing and the orchestra in perfect balance which packs the punches, rather than any one idea in the staging, but that's not necessarily any defect.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/billy-budd-glyndebourne-festival-opera,
810,"Tosca, English National Opera",Tosca,English National Opera,2010-05-18,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"Rarely have I seen an opera where so much of the activity, so much of the detailed business of relating, loving, falling out and hating, has rung so true for so much of the time. And never do I remember this truthfulness coming from such simplicity. For, in terms of set, costume and conception, this is a very ordinary, recognisable, dependable, 19th-century Tosca. But what soprano-cum-director Catherine Malfitano (once a star Tosca herself) does with these familiar ingredients is quite extraordinary.We don't have to wait long for the first sign that Malfitano's handling of the drama will be special, the curtains rising on a palpitating cloak bent under the church sanctuary. We are, of course, glimpsing the crazed freedom-fighter Angelotti (the purring bass-baritone of Pauls Putninš), whose decision to steal himself away to the sacristy will lead to the massacre of the three leads. It's one of several chilling and slightly mysterious stills that haunt this production. Malfitano's next moment of brilliance is what gives the opera its heart beat: the love scene.Oh boy, what a love scene. Usually there's something forced about the amount of time it takes for the embrace, the fallout and reconciliation of Tosca and Cavaradossi to work itself out. Here, it seemed like the most natural thing in the world. Malfitano has them both fly across the church after their row, sitting slumped on two opposing pillars, Cavaradossi slowly crawling back towards Tosca with entreaties, Tosca flirtatiously still. It's a stroke of genius to have them apart and restrained during this moment of high musical passion. Like two charged magnets you could almost see blue sparks flying between them.With everything so deeply internalised, singers Julian Gavin (Cavaradossi) and Amanda Echalaz (Tosca) could concentrate on their voices and soar. The confidence with which Gavin opened the opera was breathtaking, his big, open, generous sound offering up a vision of complete freedom. Like Gavin, Echalaz too was big and generous with her lungs, but hers is a voice that follows the contours of the drama better than Gavin's, mutating in colour and texture as Scarpia whittles away her options.The entry of Anthony Michaels-Moore's Scarpia upsets things more than a little, not just with their relationship, but with my relationship to the production. Sure, a dramatic energy was maintained - Scarpia kneeling on the sofa like a little kid just before his attempted rape of Tosca; Tosca sitting weakly on a chair watching Cavaradossi's torture - but rarely was this drama emanating from Michaels-Moore himself. In spite of some decent smiley-madman schtick, he couldn't quite sustain the full blackness of this role and his voice, though large, smudged things too often.With the Third Act, we were back on form. There was plenty more quiet brilliance from Malfitano here - a chilling execution, a ghostly fall - and a bit of very loud brilliance from set designer Frank Philipp Schlössmann, whose realistic, lightly fragmented designs achieve a sort of Wagnerian apotheosis, with a stony U-bend framing nothing less than the cosmos itself, rendered in all its glistening, starry, gaseous finery.Echalaz's voice grew more and more pitch-perfectly wild as the situation turned nasty. Malfitano's vision grew more and more meditative, everyone having a little gaze into the attractive heavens. And in the pit, conductor Edward Gardner drew out the most beautiful and tender playing from the ENO orchestra that I have ever heard. This was a Tosca at its plainest, simplest and most inspired. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/tosca-english-national-opera,

813,"Juan Diego Florez, Barbican Hall",Juan Diego Florez,Barbican Hall,2010-05-08,Edward Seckerson,"Can we clear something up once and for all, please? Yet again this week an all too familiar headline caught my eye: “Is Juan Diego Florez the heir apparent to Pavarotti?” Or words to that effect. Why do these lazy (and/or ill-informed) editors and their headline writers keep asking the same rhetorical question? Surely they should know by now that the answer is a great big resounding “no”. Not because Florez is inferior or less famous or lacks the potential for superstardom (the marketing men have already gone into overdrive about him) but quite simply because he is a completely, utterly, different kind of tenor. Ok, so he and the big man with the handkerchief may have crossed over on a couple of bel canto roles, but that’s as far as it goes, folks. Florez is never going to sing “Nessun dorma” – deal with it.So what kind of tenor is Florez? Well, the Italians might call him a tenore di grazia – a graceful lyric tenor with agility: namely the ability to finely nuance and spin the coloratura with a precision and speed that wider bore or more ample voices (like Pavarotti’s) could only dream of. And there’s something else. The tessitura of Florez’ voice is set so high that, vocally speaking, he sits on that high-wire above the stave and looks down at other tenors for whom a high C is a much bigger deal than it is for him. Florez pops those out with casual aplomb.  What you see is what you get: he looks exactly as you would expect him to sound – slight and dapper, elegant and boyish in his white tie and tails. A charming and slightly vulnerable figure – until he starts to sing, that is. Then he’s punching above his weight – bantam – to retain the world title in his fach. He and his pianist, Vincenzo Scalera, started with Cimarosa – an aria about illicit young love from Il matrimonio segreto and instantly found mischief in the rhythm and articulation with every last grace note underscoring a twinkle in the eye.  Then came his beloved Rossini who, in tenorial terms, dreamed only of life on the high ledger lines. There were two romantic songs from his collection “Sins of Old Age” and in the second of them “The Sylvan (Romance)” elaborate melismas lent great poignancy to the protestations of the lovelorn Sylvan. Florez always sings simply and honestly and with great style but I would like him to sustain phrasings more across the bars – that would compensate a little for the lack of resonance in the timbre and the way in which its reediness is apt to die more quickly.   He was wonderful in Rodrigo’s aria from Rossini’s Otello softening key words and phrases like “tradito amor” (“betrayed love”) and overcoming unfortunate associations with the infamous “Cat Duet” (same music) in the showy resolution where the vengeful roulades really fizzed. And, boy, does he know how to maximise a pay-off and invite, no demand, the roar of the crowd  - a sound he clearly relishes. Who wouldn’t?  I personally loved his selection of Spanish songs and one in particular – “The Emigrants” by Rafael Calleja and Tomas Barrera – smouldered magnificently. The homesick heartache of it had him digging deeper for a darker, swarthier, sound and the reach of the phrasing and the intensity of the line was something I’d been waiting for all evening.  It’s good, too, to hear him dipping into roles that he would maybe never contemplate singing on stage – like Massenet’s Werther where he rode the impassioned “Pourquoi me réveiller?”ardently against just piano but which still, if one’s honest, cried out for a beefier more refulgent vocal production. “Viens, gentille dame” from Boieldieu’s La dame blanche was much more his territory, the fioratura deliciously light on the chords and with one ascent into head voice quite literally taking the breath away.  A bunch of familiar encores added to the tally of high Cs but not much more. It’s not a timbre I personally want to listen to all night though of its kind it would very likely have had Rossini putting the cooking on hold and reaching for his pen once more.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/juan-diego-florez-barbican-hall,

815,"Aida, Royal Opera House",Aida,Royal Opera House,2010-04-27,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"David McVicar's new Aida production had an opening mise en scène of such unashamed ugliness, a revolving main feature (a wall of scaffolding) of such audacious featurelessness, a wardrobe of such brazen tastelessness (think Dungeons and Dragons), that my critical faculties sort of went into a coma. I looked on, my mouth so wide open I was virtually dribbling, wondering what had happened to the great McVicar, praying for the return of a refreshed and fragrant reality, imagining that something - a fire, a flood - might intervene on my behalf between now and the end of the opera to restore the stage to sanity. And you know what happened? A miracle. By the start of Act II, the aesthetic cretinism had gone and many things of beauty and thought began to creep out onto stage.Coursing through this new-found aesthetic coherence were nudity and ideas - fresh ones. The work, not famous for a dramatic litheness, seemed from here on in to acquire an ever-increasing speed. It had grown a combustion engine. We left the end of Act I in a burst of Bacchanalian blood-thirstiness - in which a topless, frieze-like movement among a group of murderous slave girls is unleashed on a human prey - and we sped into a highly pornographic, highly good value, orgiastic dance in Act II. McVicar imagines the barbaric, processional world of Aida as a repository for all our best-loved dystopias. One such dystopia is the dissolute court, as represented by that surrounding Amneris, the jealous suitor to war hero Radames, all of which nicely leads the mind to world of Salome.Beyond this courtly formality and sexual violence are characters and costumes, processions and events that allude to a syncretic amalgam of every primitively vegetative and anomically advanced society we have ever attempted to conjure up. Hence, an indigenous barbarism dances around a post-industrial apocalypse. And a real show emerges, one full of leering voodoo, nubile ladies, bloodied gladiators engaging in martial art aggro and a cloud of human carcasses swinging from the rafters. So a bumpy start, but McVicar ultimately does come up with the goods. As does Verdi. Aida may be an opera-by-numbers, lurching between sclerotic clunk and clunking sclerosis, but it does contain some scene-stealing moments. The clarinet in act four, the flute at the beginning of act three that is the perfect misty accompaniment to Aida and Radames' water-borne elopement.Voices rang out simply and often crudely. Robert Lloyd (the King of Egypt) was the definition of stentorian. Marianne Cornetti's Amneris was vocally if not theatrically effortless. Marcelo Alvarez (Radames) was the consummate hothead. Micaela Carosi (Aida) delivered her lines with a particular full-bodiedness and amazing disregard for the well-tempered scale.It wasn't a cast with much holding power. The final scene saw all the voices cracking, thinning and sagging like an old face. Luisotti kept the orchestra going at a decently pacey standard. And, by the third act, McVicar had yet again run out of ideas. And still that bizarre chunk of scaffold, like some forlorn memorial to the decline of the building trade, kept revolving. McVicar at his best and worst.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/aida-royal-opera-house,

817,"Prima Donna, Sadler's Wells",Prima Donna,Sadler's Wells,2010-04-12,David Nice,"Why write gluey pastiche Massenet and Puccini when you could compose as your flamboyant self? Why collaborate on a cliché-ridden French text when your song lyrics declare themselves so piquantly in English? Rufus Wainwright must have his own reasons for concocting a fantasy of what opera might, or used to, be. Frankly I'd prefer an honest, Mamma Mia!-style confection of the masterly, and undeniably operatic, pop hits from his two Want albums. Yet the funny thing is that at the end of a weird but stylishly presented evening of Prima Donna, though resisting the obligatory standing ovation, I did want to hug the pretty thing for his tenacity in sticking to his operatic guns. What began in sticky artifice ended in a chaste authenticity.That was largely due to the dignity of a fine production team, very different from the one behind last year's Manchester world premiere, and a top-notch quartet of singers led by a great if underrated singing actress, soprano Janis Kelly. She's lived on stage the agony of traviata Violetta's fading charms and the gaze into the mirror of Richard Strauss's Marschallin, facing the ageing process and the loss of her young lover. Yet this character, Régine Saint Laurent, is a strange and dubious archetype of a disintegrating operatic icon, not a person; any of the human questions about what becomes of the woman once la voce deserts the artist simply aren't explored.  The first act, which attempts to set up the crisis, is a musical-dramatic quagmire, and none of director Tim Albery's habitual clarity can make it move any more naturally. Puccini, whose perfect sense of dramatic timing might have been more useful to Wainwright than his harmonic flavourings, would never have started an opera with the bittersweet dawn introduction we have here; surely he would have saved it for a last-act prelude, having plunged us into the bustle of the big night on which Régine is about to fail, here very much in the past. Wainwright and co-librettist Bernadette Colomine show us Régine already declined six years down the line; she can only retreat into an operatic dreamworld. We could have skipped with no loss the pallid duet with sympathetic maid Marie (Rebecca Bottone) and the hiss-boo bullying of ambitious Philippe (veteran Jonathan Summers, as a character left to his own brutish devices), and started with curtain-up on the interview with our newly-Deneuved Prima Donna about to be conducted by a young journalist.  Up to this point, Wainwright has resisted all but a phrase or two of his signature style, lapsing from romantic opera to the kind of musiquette churned out by minor French composers in the 1920s. Now, as Colin Ainsworth's ringing tenor André Letourneur sings of his own potential opera career that never materialised and proves - quelle surprise - he can play the hero to Régine's greatest triumph as Aliénor d'Acquitaine, a haunting ostinato takes over. Soon the orchestral colours, well handled by the Royal Ballet Sinfonia under Robert Houssart, begin to parallel a typically wacky Wainwright arrangement and we breathlessly wait for the hit aria and duet from the iconic opera.  They don't quite deliver, but we do remember them when they return in a focal dream sequence in Act Two. It starts with a dramatically redundant but rather attractive ditty for Marie - Wainwright in folk vein, Bottone managing stratospheric writing to match Ainsworth's gamely taken challenges, though neither younger singer is comfortable with the lower-register demands - before Régine takes true centre stage. Again, Wainwright's purely instrumental ambition is surprising, as the diva's vocalises pass to celesta and on to feathery strings (as far as I can work out, Wainwright did the orchestration himself with ""assistance""). It's now that the discreetly crumbling Parisian apartment (designed by the usually phantasmagorical Antony McDonald) lends its own eerie, candlelit magic before the windows lift to be replaced by a moon and cypresses and the Aliénor duet has its dream high noon.  Tristan und Isolde it isn't, but Wainwright then moves fluidly to Régine's final breakdown. Kelly resists hamming it up and, with the dangers of a potential Rosenkavalier trio duly avoided - our journalist tells her he has a date with his fiancée, Sophie (geddit?), and she bows out with a Marschallin-like grace hardly merited by the situation - glides to the final number as Régine sees the ephemera of life in a Parisian firework display. Simple in its range and effect, the only ""aria"" in the show to sound like Wainwright at his authentic best - words excepted - it's beautifully served by La Kelly and by the fading lighting of Thomas Hase, a key player in the evening's success. The illusion holds to the blackout. Maybe it was all smoke and mirrors; maybe that was the point. If Régine is trying to tell us, like Shakespeare's Parolles, ""simply the thing I am shall make me live"", that would be a relief after all the kitschy flim-flam. Unlike the premiere's director, Daniel Kramer, Albery at least gives us that more human option. Anyway, Rufus seems to have had his vision, and without, it seems, an eye to commercial success. In that, at least, he remains idiosyncratically on course.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/prima-donna-sadlers-wells,
818,"Platée, Opera du Rhin",Platée,Opera du Rhin,2010-03-26,ismene Brown,"French geography has a significant hand in the small but exuberantly formed opera and dance that comes out of that civilised country - scaled for the important theatres that lie far beyond Paris and which have a great deal to teach Britain about creating a vivid national landscape. Opera du Rhin’s smashing new production of Rameau’s Platée in Strasbourg is produced for small theatres but with not the slightest diminution of vitality and ingenuity, and if you didn’t catch it streamed live last week on arteliveweb.com  or in its home theatre in Strasbourg, then you can still speed to Mulhouse quickly for that rarity, a properly funny Platée. And why would you? Because the two driving creative forces will soon be in Britain.Christophe Rousset is a William Christie protegé who in 1991 set up Les Talens Lyriques, a small theatrically driven baroque music ensemble which injects new life into old operas with the delicately passionate responsiveness of his direction and the clean individuality of sound that emerges from his two dozen or so instrumentalists on period instruments. He will be doing Handel's Semele in July at the Barbican while Platée’s director Mariame Clément is said to be working with Glyndebourne Touring Opera next year. This Strasbourg staging indicated that both are electric sparks of freshness able to light up small theatres and small budgets with big effect, rather in the style of Matthew Bourne or Rupert Goold - where theatre, singing and movement meet unafraid of making modern theatre out of old pieces.Platée is a ruthless tale of marital gamesmanship between some very fishy characters, from idle gods to conceited frogs.  Written for a royal divertissement in 1745, its joie de vivre comes from Rameau’s zippy economy - bursting with tunes and ideas, he never dallies with one long before ushering the next one in, and the effect is of a divertingly rich musical cartoon in which you long to stop and stay awhile with, say, the heartstopping Purcellian gravity of  the chorus “Hymen, l’amour t’appelle” which so briefly halts the hyperactive mayhem. There are several testing vocal roles, most spectacularly the soprano coloratura role of Folie and the title part for a high tenor with large physical confidence.Platée means, as much as anything, ""flattened"", which is certainly what she is by the end, not entirely her own fault. She's a vain waternymph - more of a frog, really - who is set up as a fake mistress for Jupiter in order to annoy his paranoid wife Juno. In the late 1990s the great American choreographer Mark Morris created a dance farce out of it, with an emphatically reptilian “heroine” and a refreshing cascade of cute or sly choreography. The coterminous Paris Opera staging by Laurent Pelly, filmed on DVD, has flamboyant era-crossing costumes and a faintly Kermit-like Platée. Opera du Rhin’s production makes a virtue of being small, smart and very transportable, by finding a remarkably convincing modern context for this wacky story.Clément has relocated the story into Fifties America, to make a jolly satire on the burgeoning consumer society. The gods are versions of Mad Men, overpaid, underworked, highly groomed, louchely cooking up marital conspiracies and downfalls between cocktails simply to pass the time. Jupiter and Juno are the hosts, but on non-speakers, and the guests mostly side with the promiscuous Jupiter against his righteously jealous wife - no doubt as true in the 1950s as it was in the 1750s.Hapless Platée is the harmless occupant of the aquarium in their bedroom - and she gets fished out by two of the more mischievous guest divinities and turned life-size, in order to be the patsy for their hosts. This is all most entertainingly staged with the aquarium presented in two sizes simultaneously: on human scale (small) and on frog scale (large). With a froggy head, a long lizardy tail and fat female breasts and tum, she is perhaps more a eunuch than a girl, and, dripping with vanity, she is a figure ripe for mockery by all. While not all the casting in Strasbourg was tip-top, Emiliano Gonzalez Toro was a peach of a Platée - he has not only a voice of plangent beauty and flexibility in expressiveness, but a chubby appealing face that you couldn’t help loving. Even when dressed and primped up as a model Fifties housewife (right), in blonde flick-up hairdo and pink coat with matching accessories (tail dangling out, stubby green feet stuffed into kitten heels), Toro never quite seemed a grotesque fright, but a more a candidate for Gok Wan to teach to look good naked.The boldly imaginative Clément uses the device of the new-fangled TV consumerism to hilarious effect, with the two female divinities of Amour and Folie luring Platée into the game in the guise of soap commercials hostesses selling her miracle deodorants, hair spray,  domestic appliances, everything she needs to become the ideal American housewife. They step out of the TV, as - with increasing pottiness - do early TV characters, funniest of all the cowboys and Indians who leave their backscreen of Monument Valley to join in a prim gavotte as pristine as Jane Austen.There are some good movement ideas here, invented by Clément with her choreographer Joshua Monten (a nice storm when the aquarium gets sloshed around by the gods, and the waternymphs - bathing beauties straight from Esther Williams films -  totter from side to side), but Monten’s dances remained in need of joining up into something more in keeping with Rameau's highly polished sassiness.Regional theatres in Britain, indeed the whole population, would surely take Platée and other baroque opera to its heart with this sort of production, and surely this scale of thinking and inventiveness is the way to go here as well as France. This year's Edinburgh Festival fields a Porgy and Bess from Opera de Lyon staged by a French dance company - surprise, surprise.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/plat%C3%A9e-opera-du-rhin,

820,"Katya Kabanova, English National Opera",Katya Kabanova,English National Opera,2010-03-15,David Nice,"It's amazing how much you can tell of what lies ahead from the way a conductor handles a master composer's first chord. Katya Kabanova's opening sigh of muted violas and cellos underpinned by double basses should tell us that the Volga into which the self-persecuted heroine will eventually throw herself is a river, real or metaphorical, of infinite breadth and depth. And that was exactly what Mark Wigglesworth conjured from ENO strings in a performance more alert to the value of every note and colour in Janáček's lightning-flash score than any I've heard. David Alden's production and a strong cast eventually match their conductor's demands in a third act which ruthlessly enfolds Katya's struggle towards the light in terrifying darkness.The insights, though never the pace, are slow in coming. In telescoping Russian theatrical pioneer Ostrovsky's 1859 drama of stifling, brutish provincial life, Janáček sheds nuance in most of the characters around the loving, tortured wife of mother's boy Tikhon Kabanov. They are one-dimensional, but they should still be recognisable as human beings, which not all of them are here.Alden's favourite brand of expressionism, last season stretching the already broader-brushstroked Borough folk of Britten's Peter Grimes on the rack, fostered over-acting in John Graham Hall's Tikhon, Clive Bayley's too-repulsive uncle Dikoy and several of the smaller roles. Anna Grevelius and Alfie Boe as spirited, socially aware young lovers Varvara and Kudriash were more successful in embodying caged, superabundant vitality. Their projection of the text was impeccable, too, a virtue of the evening as a whole much assisted by Alden's insistence on downstage delivery.Against these bundles of energy, the stillness of Susan Bickley's very imperial Kabanicha, her awful authority emphasised by gleaming tone rather than the usual paintstripping old-baggery, is matched by the pent-up feelings of Patricia Racette's downtrodden daughter-in-law. This Katya may not attain the ultimate in sensual abandon, which would be difficult given lyric-heroic tenor Stuart Skelton's hardly charismatic object of desire. In any case  Janáček makes sure the sensuousness is always shipwrecked by self-flagellating religious guilt. What Racette does have in spades is a gleaming, secure middle register which allows her to enunciate beautifully and which connects well to a slightly more spread top.The real pay-off comes in the insistence on the space between Katya and everyone else. On the ENO's wide stage, extended beyond the proscenium arch to which Racette's heroine clings for comfort, distance is always emphasised, whether in the bare open vasts in front of the white slashes on canvas Charles Edwards uses to suggest the Volga, or in the shadows that wedge themselves between the characters against the wall of the Kabanov house. Perhaps the garden love-scene is too bleak, symbolic though it may be of Katya's still riven state of mind. Under a single lamp-post, the men never take their coats off; can this really be a summer night?Shocking rewards are more justifiably reaped in the starkest of third acts. It hits us all the more powerfully without a preceding intermission (Glyndebourne undermined the supreme tension of Nikolaus Lehnhoff's unsurpassable Katya with a dinner interval three times the length of what followed). The half-ruined church with frescoed scenes of hell in which characters seek shelter from the impending storm becomes a proto-revolutionary poster shrilling damnation which collapses, like the heroine, at the height of the onslaught. Everything closes down for Katya's endgame, even the abstract river vista which will be her only possible way out. Alden's finest touch, hand in glove with Adam Silverman's quick-change lighting, finds Katya and Boris walking a tightrope in near-darkness from opposite sides of the stage to meet for one brief moment of true togetherness.The hushed tenderness of the ENO Orchestra's phrasing under Wigglesworth is almost too painful to bear here. Either side of it a single clarinet note seems to come from the depths of Katya's tormented spirit and an oboe wails an unearthly threnody over her drowned body. Janáček, who insisted upon the expressive significance of every tone from voices and instruments, would surely have approved. And like Robin Ticciati, conductor of the superlative Glyndebourne on Tour Jenůfa, Wigglesworth understands the unbearable tension of silence. What is unsung or unplayed is as vital as what we see. When Alden's pared-down, even in earlier stages uncharacteristically bland vision matches that, great music-theatre happens naturally.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/katya-kabanova-english-national-opera,

In four and half hours you see 26 ways of how not to handle the Baroque aria. Dramatic success in Handel and his psychological flights of mainly soliloquising fancy is never easy but last night's ill-fated Royal Opera House production (Placido Domingo called in sick a few weeks back) was a lesson in abject theatrical failure. Or actually 26 lessons (there are around 27 arias in all). First up in the Graham Vick how-not-to-illustrate-an-aria class: clog-dancing. Particularly not to be used as an opener, particularly not suited for genocidal tyrants in drag or for singers who, well, could sort of pass for clog-dancers.Second way not to illustrate an aria: hyper-emoting in the manner of Celine Dion. Third: mining the sign-language of CBeebies. Fourth: using a Generation Game conveyor belt of blue elephants as a fun distraction. Fifth: avoid ornamental dancing Ottoman soldiers, unless you're working on a camp-off with the makers of The Graham Norton Show.Sixth: steer clear of CBeebies sign-language in duet or trio form. Seventh: refrain from mounting singers on aforementioned elephants for comic or lavish effect. Eighth: avoid shoving the small, fine voice of Sara Mingardo (Andronico), the most musical singer in the cast, where no one can hear her. Ninth: don't revolve singers on giant turntables if completely and utterly and brainlessly unnecessary. Tenth: avoid any sort of sheet dance - yes, that's any dance involving the use of sheets, linen or otherwise.Eleventh: if a character feels lost, try to think of something a bit better than having them ape a blind man. Twelfth: don't then force all the dancing Ottoman janissaries to go blind too. Thirteenth: Monty Python's giant foot, which Vick resurrects as a political swingometer (above), is not a very sophisticated metaphor for the fluctuations of tyrannical power. You get the picture. That was how the first two acts unfolded: as a collection of out-and-out missteps and befuddling oddities.It's not even as if Tamerlano has one of those bafflingly baroque, Baroque librettos. At its core are two fascinating and eminently updatable concepts - the love of power and the power of love - and a string of pearly arias. To do so little dramatic driving or narrative sculpting of these, not to pick up on, or intelligently tease out, the numerous psychological twists and turns that are there in the musical and dramatic terrain, to summon up instead neither an accurately real, nor interestingly surreal, minimalist world, effete and ill-defined, is a serious failure of duty.As was much of the singing. Most noticeable was Christianne Stotijn (playing Tamerlano the clog dancer), whose ravaged voice had almost split in two, and an out-of-tune Christine Schäfer (Asteria). Only Renata Prokupić's Irene had the requisite ability to control and project with real satisfaction. Kurt Streit (Domingo's replacement as Bajazet) seemed to coast a little at the start but then flowered both in character and in voice in the Third Act.The Third Act, in fact, saw the whole production, the whole cast and orchestra, in the best form of the evening. As the drama closed in on the six characters, the mood blackening, the psychological relations spinning into extremity, so Vick was forced to start to focus his mind on the topic of human interaction without recourse to mindless frippery. Tenderness, intensity and a forward-spinning dynamic all suddenly started to bubble up to the surface as the singers began to work in ensemble. The singing tightened up. Ivor Bolton's conducting of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, lacking the necessary bass welly in the first two acts, unleashed some ravishing melancholic playing and then, in the final quartet, skipped into the gentlest, most sunnily winning of dances. But after four-and-a-half long hours, it was far too little, far too late.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/tamerlano-royal-opera,
823,"Philip Glass: Satyagraha, ENO/ LSO, Alsop, Barbican",Philip Glass: Satyagraha,ENO/ LSO,2010-02-25,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"It has always been a cornerstone of my personal philosophy that beauty and insight can be found in the very lowest of common denominators. That Big Brother, Friends, Love It magazine or Paris Hilton provide revelations about life that are of as much consequence, of as much wonder, as any offered up by the classic pantheon. That that which the people respond to must and usually does have plenty of merit lurking within it. And so I have always held out hope that Philip Glass, the most popular of living classical composers, is actually quite good, somehow, somewhere. But, actually, he really isn't. Philip Glass is genuinely just a load of old bollocks.His oratorio-cum-opera Satyagraha starts with some promise. It starts with four chords. That's three more than anyone versed in Glass's music is probably expecting. It sort of lulls you into a false sense of security. Well, four chords, eh? Might not be such a dull night after all! For the love of God, don't think this; it'll get you into trouble. You might, you know, actually get into him. Not as unlikely a thing as you might think.Philip Glass is a dangerous composer. He has the same effect on the ears as a packet of Pringles does on the stomach. Once you pop, you can't stop - you can't stop shovelling his empty chords down your gob, even while your gob is trying to vomit up your arms, that is. Shovel, shovel, shovel. Over three hours of it. Like a good Chinese meal, you feel full and hungry and vomitous all at once.After the ENO's revival production, you also feel terribly puzzled. Which was shittier, one wonders: the music or the staging? The music, you see, gets a little better. In Act Two, there's some variety. It sounds like it might break free into Borodin. In Act Three there are relatively exotic chord combinations and chromatic overhangs - though still nothing that would frighten any self-respecting boy band. A pretty basic rule becomes apparent: the more chords there are the better the music is. It's something Glass should perhaps mull over.Yet the staging never gets past dreadful. There's a Notting Hill carnival-dreadful at the off - women on stilts, giant papier-mache monsters and body-sculpting - and a political video-type-dreadful at the end - Gandhi and Martin Luther King in a slow-mo vanquishing of darkness. It's twee and saccharine, like something my local Lib Dem council might cook up one evening for a bit of community bonding.There's no libretto to speak off, just a few vapid offcut aphorisms from the Bhagavad Gita and Gandhi, which are repeated ad nauseam. What content there is is profoundly suspicious. Perfectly reasonable if truistic statements like ""be friendly and compassionate"" rub shoulders with pseudo-Buddhist bunk, ""be same in pleasure as in pain"", ""be done with thoughts of 'I' and 'mine'."" As Paris Hilton might say: yeah, whatever.Symbolic of the profound lack in this opera was the silence from the pit before the start of each act. Rather than the usual cacophony of practice and play-back, there was total peace. No one has to practise before Satyagraha because there is nothing to practise. Indeed, there is nothing in Satyagraha at all: no music, no characters, no plot, no interest, no point. I would have learnt more if I had stared at a wall.Yet despite all this cretinism, despite Satyagraha being one of the worst operas, and Phelim McDermott's one of the worst productions, history has ever thrown up, the London Symphony Orchestra's concert last Sunday might have pipped it to the post of worst classical event of the year so far.LIFE: A Journey Through Time - for, lo, yes, that was the concert's fabulous name -  was as execrable as the title suggests. A tangle of weak cuts from Glass's film scores spliced together crassly follows a series of dishonestly tarted-up National Geographic photos of nature, looking nothing like nature does, obeying some fatuous, first-base idea of aesthetics, over-saturated, over-abstracted, whorish and wrong. None of this, I hasten to add, was Marin Alsop or the LSO's fault, who played Glass's retarded scores with gusto.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/philip-glass-satyagraha-eno-lso-alsop-barbican,
824,"La Traviata, Chelsea Opera Group, QEH",La Traviata,Chelsea Opera Group,2010-02-21,David Nice,"Marie Duplessis, Alexandre Dumas the Younger's real-life ""lady of the camellias"", was only 23 when consumption finally claimed her. Ignore a few lines about youth in Verdi's operatic treatment, though, and there's no reason why courtesan Violetta shouldn't be a woman of advancing years who finds true love with a man half her age or more; think Chéri (Colette's novel, not the film if you please). Yet the real prompting for that stalwart of the London amateur and semi-professional music scene Chelsea Opera Group to choose Romanian-born diva Nelly Miricioiu as its traviata in concert was because they adore her, she loves them and all they've put on for her,  and so her request to impersonate opera's most heartrending fallen woman one more time, and in concert, was not hard to grant.Miricioiu is perhaps the last great exponent of old-school bel canto after Renata Scotto but, as she well knows, reprising a former cornerstone of her repertoire - I first saw her Violetta, and wept, back in the early 1980s - carries its risks, especially when you're only just recovering from a heavy cold in the head. She knows how to pace herself, can still toss off a stylish run or two, and remains unsurpassed in pointed, meaningful delivery of Italian recitative. It was clear that the furious coloratura desire to forsake the prospect of true love and to plunge into the vortex of Parisian sensuality, ""Sempre libera"", was going to be a challenge, and it was, for all of us; Nelly didn't have to take the optional E flat at the end, but she did, and she might have regretted it.Never mind; the wronged woman sacrificing herself on the altar of father Germont's respectability was bound to be plangent, and the arching phrases of ""Dite alla giovine"" were as affecting as they can be. The farewell of the last act proved stylish, if artful - at that pace, we could have had both verses rather than just the one among most of the usual cuts - and, yes, she died in style. But how truthful was it? Time has moved on; while not every Violetta has to be a raven-haired beauty like Gheorghiu or Netrebko, we've come to expect honesty in the courtesan's consumptive desolation. Miricioiu's grand manner, all beseeching arm gestures and careful wrap-adjusting, is very much old-school, and a little self-contained; she could have made eye contact more often with her fellow singers.After all, the Alfredo, her 32-year-old compatriot and Vienna State Opera regular Cosmin Ifrim, seemed to be crying out for greater engagement. He finally got it as he leaned over his seated, dying mistress in ""Parigi, o cara"", a hallowed phrasing of all four lines in one breath which would have made stones weep, and certainly brought out the best in Miricioiu. This had to be the evening's biggest moment of grace. Earlier, Ifrim was allowed his baby-tenor moment in the sun, capping his buoyant, charming aria of soaring spirits with a ringing top C that deservedly stopped the show.His supportive conductor, Gianluca Marcianò, was another revelation: getting the best out of veiled Chelsea Opera strings in a Prelude which immediately drew us in, chamber-wise; bouncing the party music and the choral diversions along at brisk but never forced speeds, mouthing every word and keeping every bit-part singer in order. Some needed it, and none should have used the music once they saw that the three principals were doing without scores, but among them there was at least a very distinguished Flora who would certainly pass muster as top party hostess, ENO mezzo Anne-Marie Gibbons.Alan Opie completed the line-up as a Giorgio Germont of the right dark Verdi-baritone timbre, a little too unyielding and self-regarding perhaps for the father who should eventually unbend. Otherwise, here was a vindication of how Verdi's masterpiece can pass in a flash given masterful conducting, how exciting it is to hear a real light Italianate tenor at a time when they're not exactly in plentiful supply, and how much we can still learn from Miricioiu. I wasn't quite inspired to stand along with the many Nelly queens in the audience, but it was certainly an evening of top-notch surprises.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-traviata-chelsea-opera-group-qeh,

With one sexy shake of her hips, Sarah Tynan's immeasurably winning blonde-bobbed Adina, a Marilyn Monroe-like tease, the till-girl and owner of a Midwest diner and filling station, which rotates - almost as stunningly as Tynan - amid the nothingness of desert and sky, clutches a mop and swings this music and its troop of jiving dotted quavers into a boppy, rock 'n' rolling, Little Richard heaven. It was just a small hint of the joys to come.It takes roughly, ooh, about five minutes for Jonathan Miller's new production of Donizetti's The Elixir of Love (whose 1950s set had the audience gawping smilingly within seconds) to start electrifying the nerve-endings into orgasmic spasm. With one sexy shake of her hips, Sarah Tynan's immeasurably winning blonde-bobbed Adina, a Marilyn Monroe-like tease, the till-girl and owner of a Midwest diner and filling station, which rotates - almost as stunningly as Tynan - amid the nothingness of desert and sky, clutches a mop and swings this music and its troop of jiving dotted quavers into a boppy, rock 'n' rolling, Little Richard heaven. It was just a small hint of the joys to come.Dr Miller has become a sort of court physician to the operatic art form. He will visit an ailing operatic patient, a doddery old staple classic, an Alzheimer's-riddled bit of bel canto. He'll check its pulse, inspect its ears, scan its flab and dive it into emergency operation: sometimes just intense psychological therapy, sometimes a full surgeon's op. The resulting transformations are as successful as the Hollywood snip, buying these former operatic glamour-pusses at least four more decades of public mileage.Well, he's done it again. Another successful hospitalisation delivered. Donizetti's L'Elisir d'Amore becomes The Elixr (the swallowed 'i' indicating, yes - traditionalists, fetch your smelling salts - full American accents among the cast) of Love and sometimes Lurve. The pastoralism of librettist Felice Romani's Italian setting has been replaced by the capitalism of 1950s America.Within minutes of Adina's teasing jive in front of the love-struck Nemorino, a Cadillac Convertible rolls into town and with it the sweet talk of the American travelling salesman, Andrew Shore's beige-suited and fraudster-footed Dr Dulcamara, clutching a box of wonder cures. Dulcamara's hoary old comic aria as he addresses the community is transformed into the stuff of MGM musical gold: a string of magnetically performed one-liners about the elixir's medicinal and non-medicinal claims (for ""oversized posteriors"" and ""gas from your interiors"") for which Shore and librettist Kelley Rourke deserve huge credit.With one swig of the elixir Nemorino slowly feels himself becoming increasingly irresistible. In fact the 40 per cent alcohol that makes up the potion is doing that, loosening him up and transforming his lady-gathering fortunes. Few operas have such a instructive little moral in it like this. A moral that we could all learn from and live by. The essence of this one: chill out and you'll get the lady. Miller delights in Nemorino's flowering. From a solipsistic weediness, Nemorino fixed to the corner of the diner, his knees locked in a knackety embrace for his opening aria, ""She will never notice me"" - with Adina looking straight on of course - emerges a moody James Dean-like leather-clad cowboy in the second act.Miller also delights in manipulating Tynan's exquisitely lithe and malleable form. I have never seen an opera singer do so much with so little. Her slip of a body was an endlessly expressive canvas: now twisting into a rage, her arms parked jaggedly on her hips as Nemorino appears to ignore her, now shrugging her little shoulders winningly for her gum-chewing army hunk, Sarge Belcore (David Kempster).That Tynan could make so much of all these little twists and turns in personality and mood while maintaining the most natural, the most believably effortless and sexy exterior I have ever seen in an operatic actress is astonishing. Her singing was no less awesome. She dispatched all the coloratura high climbing without a second thought. And yet it was often the beauty of her descents - whose equally challenging difficulties (though coming after the money-shots) should never be overlooked or underestimated - the beauty of the finishing, that really showed off the extent of Tynan's talents. Truly, here, a star was born.And as always with Miller's productions, the harder you looked the more delights were to be found. In Miller many of the really spine-tingling moments come in the tiny departures from operatic convention, in what the singers decide not to do, as much as what they do do. What a delight to see Tynan controlling her arms, keeping them by her side, or allowing them to fiddle with her hair, so that maximum meaning could be wrought from them when necessary. And what a joy to see the chorus not act as an undifferentiated mass of theatrical wannabes (as often happens in, ahem, the other place) but as individuals in a reality we recognise.Then there are all the exquisitely realised details Miller does provide: the mimicry of Elvis from Andrew Shore's Doctor, and Betty Boop from Tynan during the wedding celebrations, the gossip and walking on hot coals in the queue for the ladies lavs where a Rizzo-like Giannetta, the superb Julia Sporsen, divulges Nemorino's new-found wealth, the dusty, rusty corners of the Hopper set designed by the brilliant Isabella Bywater. Oh, the Hopper set. I could wax lyrical about that Hopper-inspired set for a good few more hundred words. But I won't. Suffice to say, it's a perfect little green and red revolving box.So was there anything at all that creaked? Possibly, yes. John Tessier's voice didn't flower as much as his character, remaining strained and unaffecting, particularly in ""Una furtiva lagrima"". And the orchestra was noticeably ragged, the result I suspect of treating the music - actually hugely challenging in terms of phrasing and texture - with less respect than it deserves. I don't think Spanish conductor Pablo Heras-Casdo was entirely to blame for this. He was obviously concentrated on providing an orchestral mirror to the 1950s feel of the production, buzz-cutting dotted rhythms and jazzing up chromatic lines, all of which suits the light-footed musical ways of bel canto to a T.The one real oddity was the gulf between the brilliance of the ensemble acting between the lead five players, particularly the reactive fire from Andrew Shore, still the finest operatic comic singer on stage today, and the lack of balance in the ensemble singing of duets, trios and quartets. Something to work on, there. Overall, however, like his Mikado, Rigoletto, The Barber of Seville or Cosi, Miller has hit the jackpot with The Elixir. The ENO has another classic on its hands. And you won't see it surpassed I'd say for at least, ooh, the next 30 years.The Elixir of Love is at the English National Opera until 23 March. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/elixir-love-english-national-opera,

828,"Lucia di Lammermoor, ENO",Lucia di Lammermoor,ENO,2010-02-04,David Nice,"Is Donizetti's fustian operatic mash-up of Sir Walter Scott worth staging seriously? On CD, stupenda Sutherland and divina Callas continue to give us goosebumps with their darting, florid stabs at poor mad Lucia. If the difficult-to-achieve match of bel canto and dramatic intensity rests only with the lead tenor, as it did last night, what's left? Well, this revival of David Alden's 2008 production still looks stunning, well in line with ENO's high visual style so far this season. The expressionist mania bursting out of those sets and costumes, though, can't often be supported  by a score two-thirds of which I never remember having heard before.For a start, there's a lot of unintentionally comic climbing and falling in and out of the windows of the Scots country house left to rack and ruin by the crazy Ashton family. Mother is dead, leaving behind psychopathic son Enrico - Brian Mulligan, rather too gentlemanly a baritone to suggest black rage - to torture infantilised teenage sister Lucia into an unholy alliance.Though Charles Edwards's sets, variously lit by Adam Silverman, immediately create a world, the ENO male chorus got off to a ropey start, not much helped by the anodyne numbers for the first scene where it was impossible to tell if conductor Anthony Walker was doing more than a functional job or not (I'm still undecided; it's that kind of a score).Enter the heroine, singing of fountains and ghosts in front of a ruined theatre, and the energy levels didn't exactly rise with Anna Christy's singing. The traumatised, doll-like characterisation came with matching voice. Christy's is a light coloratura, certainly capable of projecting but not possessed of much tonal colour, and the bright vibrato sometimes gets in the way of spinning a proper line. What we needed was the pint-sized cut and thrust of Barry Banks, a straggly-haired wild man bouncing about in kilt and sporran (pictured right by Rob Workman/ENO) - no good for this fragile Lucia, and on the wrong side of the tracks to boot.Banks's sound has always been convincingly Italianate - he made a starry, deeply touching duo with the exquisite Mary Plazas in ENO's last Elixir of Love - and now the voice has grown in size and ring to set alongside the best. For once, the long final scene where the desperate Edgardo learns of his sundered love's untimely death really was the musical highlight of the evening.Yet of course there's an awful lot of singing before it. Could the duets with Enrico and Clive Bayley's wildly overacted and oversung religious nutcase Raimondo be pruned? I thought so. Is the climax of the opera in which Lucia, having murdered the husband she was forced to marry, gives the most plaintive account of madness in early 19th century opera worth the rescue-job it got here? Probably, though I was untouched by Christy's less than melting delivery.If Alison Martin's harp solo had brought the only touch of poetry to Lucia's earlier aria, here the restoration of the fascinating glass harmonica proved much more than a musicological curiosity. Donizetti originally intended it to be the music from beyond heard by the deranged girl - the famous phantom flute was a belated rehearsal compromise - and it eerily complemented the emptying stage around which the bloodstained bride wanders so pathetically in this production.Indeed, the look of it is what will stay with me. Brigitte Reiffenstuel's grey-black crinolines and suits, reflected in the photographs on the walls and always intelligently grouped in Edwards's sets, give a menacing air to the nuptials, relieved only by the cream-coloured swank of the wealthy bridegroom and his men. Later the revellers go briefly wild, dancing a polka in the only hyperactive part of the late, lamented Claire Glaskin's creepy, disciplined movement.As for the music, though, I'd rather have swapped the grim decay of the Scottish country house for the Cornish camp, the better English text and the more distinctive tunes of G&S's Ruddigore. Banks, in fact, would be the ideal interpreter of the vintage Sullivan ditty ""The battle's roar is over"". But he's off for more Donizetti to Covent Garden and the Met, and may they appreciate quality when they hear it.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/lucia-di-lammermoor-eno,
829,"Così fan tutte, Royal Opera/ Joyce DiDonato, Wigmore Hall",Così fan tutte,Royal Opera/ Joyce DiDonato,2010-01-30,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"Two very different lessons on love this week. From the Aphrodite-like Joyce DiDonato at the Wigmore Hall, there emerged a correct, wise, honest way to achieve an enamoured state; from the familiarly fickle cast of Così fan tutte - an almost unwatchably faulty bunch of emotional primitives in Jonathan Miller's production for the Royal Opera - very much the wrong way.Miller is absolutely right to press home the point about the unattractiveness of Così fan tutte's group of solipsists. A mirror is the star of the show as a result. No one can escape it. Fiordiligi (Sally Matthews) falls for its reflexive charms just when a tone of near-genuine emotion is being reached by Dorabella (Nino Surguladze) over her lover Ferrando (Charles Castronova). The boys fool around in it, playing war games, flexing muscles, on the eve of their pretend march to battle, all while the girls sing fretfully around them.No one in Miller's Così has the maturity to deal with anyone's emotional wellbeing but their own. Their own satisfaction is paramount; stuff everyone else. It's a take on the opera that makes sense not only of the scenario but also of the music, which are full of mocking allusions to grand tragedies by Gluck, full of fakery and falseness. Conductor Julia Jones did a fantastic job of emphasising the necessary lightness of this self-obsessed way of being. The earth was rarely encountered in her springy string lines, mirroring the way these flighty souls rarely sought to engage the truth.The games within games, the coldness of the contemporary setting - a minimalist affair, perhaps an interior designer's showroom (another facade), tasteful to the point of self-extinction - and the psychological self-absorption can spiral into meanspiritedness. But Miller provides a joyous number of observations on modern ways, on quotidian details of gesture and movement, on humour and props (including plot-propelling iPods), which leavens the cynicism.As usual with Miller, even in revival, the acting was outstanding. Surguladze's Dorabella got better and better as her voice and body relaxed into the role and her pouty, bug-eyed, flirty, inner Betty Boop came out. Troy Cook's Guglielmo (who disguises himself as a metalhead) was as saucy as Castronova's Ferrando (who becomes a hippie) was soulful. Don Alfonso (William Shimell) was nicely flinty but a little absent.Sally Matthews as Flordiligi displayed a level of acting intelligence that is very rare for the operatic stage, full of delightful subtleties. Her doubling over with laughter was a triumph, as was her false modesty, as was her awkwardness and despair. Her voice, however, too proficient and tightly upholstered, left me unmoved. Best in both fields was Helene Schneiderman's sympathetic old schemer, Despina, a tough role, in that it's meant to be funny but rarely is. Well, Schneiderman, who once played Dorabella in a past revival, pulled it off brilliantly, adopting a perfect amoral nonchalance to her ill-advised guidance.The end of this Così - as of any decent Così - leaves a thoroughly unpleasant taste in the mouth. Indeed, Miller makes it even more acrid than usual, the characters scattering left and right, fearful and bemused. There's no love here. And there perhaps never was.American mezzo Joyce DiDonato's medley recital of love songs charted a far more sage and heartfelt course through the whirlwinds of romance. There were no tales here of double-dealing or manipulation, just simple songs of love and loss, sweetness and regret.The selection ranged from the Arie antiche, a trove of early songs that stretch back to the 16th century, to the works of obscure Italian late Romantics and Debussyan acolytes. None of this recherché digging was in vain. Almost every single piece on this programme was a masterpiece in some way. The Arie antiche were particularly haunting. DiDonato's voice is a big, generous sound. It will fill whatever musical pot it has to fill and spill over some. When it combines with the spare melodic and harmonic patterns of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries -  which in the powerfully scorched stillness of the Caccini (""Amarilli mia bella"") resembled the yellow flatlands of Puglia - it can't fail to mark you, almost in the way the late great Lorraine Hunt Lieberson could. There was wisdom in her sighed Parisotti (""Se tu m'ami"") and a bittersweet honesty to the Luigi Rossi (""Mio ben, teco il tormento"").Next to this piercingly plain-speaking collection, the Beethoven Four Ariettas, Op 82, seemed too unnaturally artful, too clever in accompaniment and - except for the second version of ""L'amante impaziente"" - too lacking in charm for it to have an effect.DiDonato was just getting going, however. An aria from Rossini's Otello was up next when a mobile went off. ""It's Otello,"" she asides quick as a flash, ""Tell him it's not true."" What fun. We lilted our way through the Rossini, an encore and the interval, straight into the 20th century.First came the pungently vivid images of the Italian Debussy, Francesco Santoliquido, a remarkable composer on the evidence of his I canti della sera (1908), then the dark skies of Ildebrando Pizzetti. Interestingly, DiDonato's voice seemed slightly more suited to this late Romantic repertoire. Having such a big, bountiful voice, she almost loses control of the classical works. In the Santoliquido, the vocal spillages were a delight, a rightful bursting forth of the soul.In the last songs DiDonato had fully descended from on high. She had started the recital, in Greek dress, singing of love and its travails almost in the abstract, as an experience to be navigated in this way or that, as if a counselling Aphrodite. In the last four songs, she was roaming our paths as a real-life love-entangled Carmen. And just as we were getting used to the new sassy Joyce, she flicked on a bow-tie, knocked her knees together and launched into Cherubino's ""Voi che sapete"" with a few boyish gulps.It would have brought the house down, if she hadn't then launched into a showstopper from Rossini's La donna del lago, which, for the first time, really showed off the possibilities of her tessitura - comfortable in both directions - her flexibility, her abilitiy to conjure up new textures from thin air and at speed. With this virtuosic display, a return of divinity, the house was quite ready to explode. And explode it did.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/cos%C3%AC-fan-tutte-royal-opera-joyce-didonato-wigmore-hall,

831,"The Rake's Progress, Royal Opera House",The Rake's Progress,Royal Opera House,2010-01-22,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"Not everyone was playing for the same team in last night's revival production of The Rake's Progress. On the one side were the conductor, choir and soloists, all focused in their service and submission to unravelling this quietly brilliant piece of neoclassicism by Stravinsky - mostly pretty effectively. On the other side were the sets and direction of Carl Fillon and Robert Lepage, which included blow-up caravans, fold-out dolls' houses and a mattress-cum-Hoover sucking in lovers. Attention-seeking stuff . An initial interested ""ooh"" become a more circumspect ""oh?""; bored eyes gave way to hungry ears.Lepage transplants Auden's Hogarthian tale not unwisely to the 1950s world of ""the American dream"", to the oil fields of the Midwest and the Hollywood temptations of the West Coast. However, the detachment of the visuals - of the concept as a whole, in fact - from the music and the libretto cuts the work adrift and emphasises the biggest problems with the production's conception. If a peformance of The Rake's Progress is to work at all, it must have a pretty decent Rake and an equally robust Progress. Both were absent at the Royal Opera House.It's a wonder that Toby Spence (reprieving the role of Tom Rakewell here), such a handsome and generously voiced tenor, cannot seem to project these talents into a convincing or thoughtful stage presence. He started well, with a Texan's case for the defence of Rakewell's plans for fame and fortune; it was delivered with plenty of gusto. But from then on, one was always one step ahead of him, always unsurprised by what turn he made and bemused by those he did. The few spoken lines especially exposed his inability to internalise the role.The lack of ""Progess"", meanwhile, sprang from the lack of intellectual integrity to the Lepage concept. The moral dilemmas were never very sharply delineated or forcefully put. One modestly rakish venture - some filmed slap-and-tickle and light cocaine-snorting - would follow another without there being much sense of a shocking ethical slippage (except late on, and even then just in act not in emotion) that a rake's progress usually entails.So the night required saving. And there were two ready to save: conductor Ingo Metzmacher (always worth your while) and Rosemary Joshua as Anne Trulove, both of whom seemed to immerse themselves in their roles better than anyone else. There was something absolutely captivating about Joshua's rain-coated, furrow-browed pursuit of Tom, her love. Most of this was down to a vocal, rather than physical, acting ability; a natural, almost effortless way to inhabit each and every note, so that, like in everyday speech, all was both expected and a surprise. As the words moved, her body moved; as the emotions frayed, the face frayed.Trulove has particularly ravishing orchestral beds on which to sit, mainly lined with oboes or horn and strings, paired. In Metzmacher's hands, these delicate threads resembled the softness and suppleness of a Mozart adagio. The work is filled with these contemplative arias and ariosi, and they were, every one, a joy. Kyle Ketelsen's Nick Shadow, in fine voice, was almost there but not quite. That I barely noticed Patricia Bardon's Baba the Turk - a bearded lady - is quite an achievement.Though we missed a key dialogue between the intellectual thread of the libretto and the conceit of the visuals, with Meztmacher and Joshua burring away so beautifully throughout, a work that is widely thought of as cold ultimately came alive.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/rakes-progress-royal-opera-house,

This could also be said of some of its contestants, whose unfamiliarity with the concept of ""singing"" seemed surprising in people who perform music for a living, albeit of the non-operatic kind.Not that the concept is necessarily a bad one. The notion of recruiting a bunch of pop singers and bussing them over to the operatic sphere could have been a device for shaking up a number of preconceptions. It could have blown holes in the idea that opera is either boring or ""elitist"" by advertising its emotional reach, its drama, and its unmatched melodic splendour. And while everybody knows that singing opera demands specialised skills, surely experienced singers from a different discipline could make a plausible stab at it?It was on the latter issue that Popstar failed so catastrophically. There are pop singers who might take to opera fairly comfortably. Leona Lewis or Mary J Blige, perhaps, or Michael Buble or recent X Factor winner Joe McElderry. Michael Bolton sings operatic pieces regularly. But an air of desperation and compromise hovered over the contestants who'd been selected for the show, as if everybody who might have been able to make the thing work had smelled a rat and turned it down.Let's face it, the production team must have resorted to dog-sleds, snowmobiles and abseiling down the inside of volcanos to come up with this bunch. Marcella Detroit hasn't crossed the public's radar since she quit Shakespears Sister in the Nineties, yet here she was, obviously petrified, trying to sing Bellini's ""Casta Diva"", ""the Holy Grail of divadom"", as floridly attired judge Laurence Llewellyn-Bowen put it. Vanessa White from The Saturdays (perpetrators of six Top 10 singles, as she reminded us) sang ""O mio babbino caro"", and sounded like a bunch of alley cats stuck on a hot plate. Alex James, Blur's bass player, can't sing at all, so he enacted ""Figaro's aria"" from The Barber of Seville as a farcical comedy routine.Another problem was getting the judging tone right. This might have been easier if they'd found the right judges in the first place, but bumptious rock singer Meat Loaf contented himself with bawling out his verdicts like a small-town Sheriff from Alabama, while Llewellyn-Bowen made excruciating attempts to deliver Wildean bons mots. The singers were struggling so badly with the material that nobody had the heart to tell it like it was, and in a rational world, all of them would have been voted off at the end of the show instead of just one. That was Alex James, by the way.The two singing ""mentors"", Katherine Jenkins and Rolando Villazón, could be seen furiously improvising ways not to say ""you were ****ing terrible!"" I loved Villazón's ingenious observation that James ""embraces the singer that he is!"", while Jenkins retreated into the security of telling the contestants they weren't breathing properly or needed to expand their diaphragms more.The hosts weren't much help. Alan Titchmarsh - doesn't he do gardening programmes? -  kept announcing that we'd either heard or were going to hear ""eight outstanding performances"", with the brazen yet misplaced confidence of a man declaring the end of boom and bust. Myleene Klass has lovely teeth. Next Friday I'm going to watch Dan Snow's programme about the Royal Navy instead. ",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/popstar-operastar-itv1,

837,Classical and Opera 2000-9: The Highs and Lows,Classical and Opera 2000-9: The Highs and Lows,,2009-12-27,theartsdesk,"No great new movements or radically transformational figures emerged to dominate classical music in the Noughties (not even him up there). Just one small nagging question bedevilled us: will the art form survive? Well, it has. What appeared to be a late 20th-century decline in audience interest in the classical tradition was in fact a consumer weariness with the choices on offer. And who could blame them?  At the start of this decade, the London orchestral scene, in the hands of aging, mediocre conductors, was as appealing as a boil-in-the-bag fish dinner; administratively and artistically, English National Opera were headed inexorably downward, while the elitist Royal Opera faced yearly public birchings for its state subsidies. Today, after a decade of spring cleaning, the British classical music is the envy of the world - though, in the admirable rush to be all things to all men, some unforgivable turkeys did waddle in among the giants. Igor Toronyi-Lalic and David Nice explore what has been hot and not over the past decade.David Nice's HighsMost exciting formation of the decade: the 2003 re-birth of the Lucerne Festival Orchestra under Claudio Abbado, who made it a crack band of players he knows and loves from veteran cellist Natalia Gutman to members of the Hagen Quartet and a core of the Gustav Mahler Chamber Orchestra. Their Mahler symphonies in Lucerne and London, also captured on DVD, have consistently shown vital music-making of a perfection it’s not possible to surpass.Just as bracing in a different way is the Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra of Venezuela, flagship of the country’s amazing educational sistema. It’s actually been around for longer than the pundits like to think; it took a conductor of equal charisma who rose from the ranks, Gustavo Dudamel, to give the orchestra a sexy, media-friendly image. Their 2007 Prom had the fizz and energy of a pop concert; and why not? Best of all is the change, world-wide, in musical education for kids. It’s happened, and it’s spreading still.Director of the decade: Richard Jones. Makes the serious funny in an uneasy kind of way, and the funny worth taking seriously. From his baked-beaned Wozzeck (OK, I’ll settle for that, and the revelation of Christopher Purves’s hair-raisingly tormented soldier) for Welsh National Opera to his Young Vic Annie Get Your Gun (go before it ends on 9 January), he always comes up with something new; you never know what you’re going to get. Even the shows he thinks didn’t work – Horvath’s Tales from the Vienna Woods at the National and Weber’s Euryanthe at Glyndebourne – offered plenty of food for thought.Glyndebourne, though it can be as guilty as any house of putting on very ordinary shows, has a lot of highs to choose from. I’m torn between Melly Still’s bewitching opera-directorial debut with Dvorak’s Rusalka this season and Daniel Slater’s visual treat of a difficult-to-bring-off comedy, Prokofiev’s Betrothal in a Monastery, a couple of years ago. If I plump for the latter – and many critics hated it, while the audience had a great time every night – it’s because it fizzed under the baton of house MD Vladimir Jurowski, my conductor of the decade.Jurowski has to figure, too, as the energising force behind the renaissance of the London Philharmonic Orchestra both at Glyndebourne, where he has run the gamut from Rossini via Verdi and Wagner to Eotvos, and at the Royal Festival Hall. His one-year old series of festivals devoted mostly to one composer at the Southbank got off to a glittering start with an amazing concert performance of Tchaikovsky’s Iolanta, and seems to be bringing in younger audiences. If I have to single out one interpretation, it would be the roof-raising starburst of Schnittke’s Third Symphony only a month ago.All the orchestras, capital and regional, are now in the hands of extraordinary chief conductors. I’ve only caught up with some of them in the last couple of years, but what sticks in the mind is the unbelievably nuanced and atmospheric playing Vasily Petrenko drew from the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra in Rachmaninov’s Symphonic Dances at the 2008 Proms. The just-released recording confirms this as simply the best performance of Rachmaninov’s surprisingly profound orchestral swansong I’ve heard; and competition is amazingly strong.As for promise, it’s being realised here and now by Petrenko in Liverpool, Andris Nelsons in Birmingham, Stephane Deneve with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra and Robin Ticciati at Glyndebourne and now the Scottish Chamber Orchestra. Again, difficult to pick one concert, but – perhaps because it’s so fresh – I was both knocked for six and moved to tears by the life Yannick Nezet-Seguin breathed into the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment’s Haydn symphonies in the Southbank’s Queen Elizabeth Hall.English National Opera now has a visual and an aural style to call its own. The visual side, especially in the newly ingenious use of video projections, ran in a line from Fiona Shaw’s double bill of Sibelius’s Luonnotar and Vaughan Williams’s Riders to the Sea to the musically questionable Saariaho L’amour de loin, the stunning Fura dels Baus Ligeti Le Grand Macabre and now Rupert Goold’s radical but justifiable new Turandot. Let’s not forget, though, that even in times of trouble the artists could be relied upon to deliver the goods. Much as I hated aspects of Phyllida Lloyd’s Ring cycle, I thought her Twilight of the Gods was easily the best I’ve ever seen, superbly moulded the night I went by young conductor Dominic Wheeler and featuring an incandescent performance by Kathleen Broderick.Strong new operas are always thin on the ground. Interesting, but not wholly satisfying from the vocal point of view, have been Turnage’s The Silver Tassie, Ades’s surprisingly conservative The Tempest and Birtwistle’s grippingly produced and performed The Minotaur. Oddly, I enjoyed Barry’s screamily, queenily confrontational The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant more than any of those. The one that left me reeling, though, was James MacMillan’s The Sacrifice when Welsh National Opera brought Katie Mitchell’s searing production to London’s Sadler’s Wells. A surely ideal cast handled a score that proved singable without compromise. This is the one that deserves to last.Antonio Pappano is only one among many inspirational musical leaders of the decade. Since, however, he’s had to run the biggest ship, and decided to cover everything from Mozart (Figaro from the harpsichord, wonderful) to Birtwistle, making more of The Minotaur intelligible than anyone thought possible, he has to take the laurels. I’m not sure he has the length and breadth of Wagner sorted yet, and I guess his Don Carlo was disappointing because he had to help several singers in trouble. But like Ed Gardner at ENO, he’s knocked the chorus and orchestra into top-notch shape. My memory for the earlier part of the decade has been failing me, so let’s settle for the auspicious date in September 2002 when he took up the reins with a glittering Strauss Ariadne auf Naxos. He’s stayed faithful to the radical director, Christof Loy, ever since.A footnote: help! I’ve reached 10 and not singled out any singers, instrumentalists or chamber groups. Here’s just a little list of 10 more, picked off the top of my head and probably all too recent:- the Jerusalem Quartet for making every work a miracle of communication- Alban Gerhardt for the breadth of cello repertoire he’s revealed- Anja Harteros, ideal Verdian soprano as Amelia in Simon Boccanegra and opulent Straussian, too- audacious clarinettist Kari Kriikku for selling the contemporary so well- Toby Spence for proving that the English tenor can move beyond the wet and weedy (no names here)- the Rasumovsky Ensemble’s eight-strong Vivaldi Four Seasons, which I hadn’t been looking forward to- Sarah Connolly for plumbing the Mahlerian and Purcellian depths as well as hitting the heights at the Last Night of the Proms, after a decade of great performances- James Ehnes and Sir Andrew Davis for the perfect concerto partnership in a Philharmonia performance of Elgar’s Violin Concerto- Alexander Melnikov and Rustem Hayroudinoff among pianists, only because they’re the two among many extraordinary young Russian-trained soloists who seem to have had the least recognition.David Nice's LowsI’m going to sound Pollyannaish and claim that the good has been infinitely more memorable than the bad – which, of course, is not the same as mediocre - so I’m not stumping up a list. We all know who the bad singers on the fringes of the serious-music world are, or were; what more can I say than that listening to them might just encourage newcomers to explore the repertoire a little further?The worst thing to happen to so-called ""classical music"" this decade was its increasing marginalisation in the serious papers, so hoorah for The Arts Desk and what’s good about the blogosphere. Nothing much, it seems, can be done about its perception on telly; despite the advent of BBC Four, coverage outside Proms season is dismal and documentaries usually end up being patronising in the extreme. As for Late Review, or whatever they call that slot on BBC Two’s Newsnight, what does it take to get something featured alongside the films, the exhibitions and the plays? The last time I tuned in was when there was no-one to speak up for The Minotaur, and one of the pundits infamously declared something along the lines of ""if you think classical music is dead, go along to Covent Garden and view the corpse"". Well, the corpse is alive and kicking.Igor Toronyi-Lalic's HighsSimon Rattle and Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, Royal Festival Hall, October 2002In the summer of 2002, Simon Rattle became the first Briton to head the world’s greatest orchestra. We awaited his first visit to London with his new band with pant-wetting nervousness. My only thought was that if he cocked it up, the Berliners would surely never go British ever again. Thankfully the two South Bank performances, which included of Mahler’s Fifth and Bruckner’s Ninth, blew the audiences away.Louis Andriessen and Greetje Bijma, Queen Elizabeth Hall, October 2002It was one of the strangest and most invigorating musical encounters of my life. Minimalist compositional giant Louis Andriessen was at the piano, fingers poised, eyes bending round the piano body, watching flexi-singer Greetje Bijma's every move as she shrieked, crooned and twittered her way through parodies of everything from Mozart’s The Marriage of Figaro, to bebop and Berio, while chasing herself round on stage. Madness, for sure, but also curiously majestic.Handel's Il Trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno, Emmanuelle Haim, Le Concert d'Astree, Barbican, March 2005If it wasn’t for this astonishing performance five years ago I would have thought by now that it was nigh on impossible to pull off a decent Handel opera all the way through. Something always goes wrong. But not this time. What made this so good was not just the near perfection in casting (including Veronica Cangemi, Ann Hallenberg, Pavol Breslik and Sonia Prina), or the fact of having Haim as conductor, it was the rapport. One got the sense that there was a friendly rivalry bubbling up among these singers that spurred them on to greater and greater technical and emotional depths. As an oratorio, it needed only the lightest of dramatic touches to set it going, and what a firecracker it proved to be once it was set off.Gerald Barry’s The Bitter of Petra von Kant, English National Opera, September 2005I've never craved a new work like I have The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant after my first experience of it at the ENO, or wanted to hunt down a CD so quickly. Every second of this work fizzes with a deafening excitement and tension. The music is uncompromising, the singing fiendish and the dramatics a hurtling ball of 1970s melodramatic gaseous material. And I’ve never seen a more beautifully designed set in my life.Andrei Gavrilov’s Goldberg Variations, St John's, Smith Square, May 2006Never has a concert gone so wrong so right. Gavrilov's recorded Goldbergs are among the finest ever set to disc but personal troubles soon put paid to this bright Gouldian star. He reappeared in Westminster in 2006, a shadow of himself, nervous and sweaty, shuffling on to the stage. The Aria went well. The first variation had a mistake near the end, the second two, three, four, the third a fistful. It was terrifying for him - and for us too. Yet, it was also a miracle. A sublime glimpse to a tradition that has almost completely vanished: the tradition of the genius fumbler. Cortot and Schnabel were never clean but always great. And so too, this night, was Gavrilov.Ivan Fischer and Budapest Festival Orchestra, Usher Hall, August 2006Ivan Fischer is a rare thing among conductors: an academic and romantic, a man of ideas and raw passion, Willem Mengelberg and Nikolaus Harnoncourt rolled into one. His visits to Britain with the Budapest Festival Orchestra – the greatest Hungary has had since the time of the Esterhazy’s - have all been unmissibale but one towers above the others: his folkified Rite of Spring at Edinburgh in 2006, both a revelatory and roof-raising experience.Stefano Landi’s Il Sant’Alessio, William Christie, Les Arts Florissants, Barbican, October 2007Christie's idea to replicate the all-male first cast of this 17th-century contemplatory oratorio with eight counter-tenors sounded horrifyingly, vaingloriously nuts. In fact it was a stroke of genius, though, to this day, I have no idea how it worked or who was the true genius behind it (though Philippe Jaroussky's ravishing turn in the first act was pretty special). Whatever the case, the third act was a thing of haunting magic.Messiaen’s Vingts Regards sur L’Enfants Jesus, Pierre-Laurent Aimard, Queen Elizabeth Hall, February 2008Musically or visually, there are few more awesome sights in the world than Aimard in full sonic flow, his lick of black hair become water, splashing his face this way and that as he slams down another exotic, erotic Messaien squash chord on the grand.Harrison Birtwistle’s The Minotaur, Royal Opera House, April 2008It was only with The Minotaur that I realised how beautiful Birtwistle’s music could be, with its oceanic bass hazes and, above, lyrical lines of true wonder. The opera had its moments of bloodied violence of course, its acts of dizzying terror when John Tomlinson and his terrific lunging bull’s head came to horror-filled life. But I will also never forget the serenity of Ariadne (Christine Rice) on Alison Chitty's moonlit beach.Pierre Boulez, Ensemble InterContemporain, Royal Festival Hall, December 2008The modernists are still in the lead. Boulez's deliciously complex, delightfully frenetic Derive II (1988-2006) and sur Incises (1996-98), in which the most ravishing French sounds this side of Debussy get sent on a roller-coaster ride for half an hour, still blow all late 20th-century compositional competition out of the water. Their performance last year in Boulez's hands was jaw-dropping, heart-racing stuff.Riccardo Chailly and the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, Royal Albert Hall, August 2009Riccardo Chailly is on fire at the moment. His recent visits with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra over the past two years have been electrifying. I pick out three: a stupendous account of Tchaikovsky’s Fourth Symphony last year, a glorious St Matthew Passion in spring 2009 and a Proms visit in the late summer, where we heard Deryck Cooke’s version of Mahler’s unfinished Tenth, which had me reeling.Igor Toronyi-Lalic's LowsAndreas Scholl: The Renaissance Muse, Barbican, February 2005Dunk a counter-tenor in an ill-fitting browny jerkin, scatter frilly pillows on the Barbican stage, add similarly attired lutenist to singer's side and throw soft leaf-patterned green lighting onto their faces, and what you get is the Chernobyl of classical music, a epoch-making aesthetic, moral, philosophical and musical catastrophe so great it is thought that many turned from God as a result.Anton Safarov's completion of Schubert's unfinished Eighth, Vladimir Jurowski, OAE, Royal Festival Hall, Nov 2007My, oh, my. Even the composer looked embarrassed by this one. This was a car crash of an idea, and in the car was one of the finest works of Western art music and Safarov had removed this fine passenger's seatbelt and shoved its face through the windscreen.Simon Rattle, Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, 2003+After the initial hurrah, there hasn't been much to celebrate from what is meant to be the world's greatest musical partnership. Critics in London still hold out a hand of friendship, but in Germany the knives have been out for a few years. I haven't heard one concert by them that has been better than average and many have been far below. Now the only real interest in their output is their recorded legacy, which is, qualitatively, still holding out.Fiona Shaw’s debut at ENO with Vaughan Williams's Riders to the Sea, November 2008Two big mistakes here: Fiona Shaw and Vaughan Williams. Shaw's ability to overact and sometimes even over-overact makes most opera singers appear like they're playing poker. So, best keep her away from opera direction, I'd say. Beyond this there's the matter of Vaughan Williams's musical howler: an opera that stank so badly I could barely see the orchestra through the fumes.Osvaldo Golijov’s Ainadamar, Barbican, April 2008Ainadamar was a two-and-a-half-hour wail for the death of Communism, told through a cack-handed Lorca poem. I half expected them to offer us free lentil soup and CND badges in the interval. The opera's awfulness is a memento mori for all middle-aged adults, never to presume they know what's going down with the kids, and to remember above all that Marx went out of fashion 30 years ago.Mikhail Pletnev, Barbican, June 2006It was obvious something was up when the Barbican doors didn't open. When they did, half an hour after the concert was meant to start, we sat down, then waited a further 10 minutes for the hang-dog Pletnev to walk out onto the stage like a suicidal. He splashed his way through Tchaikovsky's Seasons and Schumann's Kreisleriana like a first-grader and received a standing ovation.Pekka Kuusisto, Britten Sinfonia, Queen Elizabeth Hall, February 2007Find me a more irritating violinist than the frolicky Finn Pekka Kuusisto and I will find you a liar. He gurns and scowls and grins and lurches more enthusiastically than your average panto dame. But as with most common criminality, it's not his fault; society is to blame, the musical society that nurtures and encourages this sort of unseemly hyperactivity because it thinks that to ram the place with children, you need children's TV presenters.Igor and Valery Oistrakh, Barbican, May 2004""The worst performance of the Bach Double Concerto in D minor I have ever heard outside of school."" The words of a very reliable usher.Mark Padmore’s St John Passion, Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, Queen Elizabeth Hall, February 2008In one or two dud concerts in 2008 the invincible shine of the period propagandists suddenly vanished for me. Padmore was attempting to recreate a more authentic conductorless approach to the Bach Passion by shedding a dominating force, sending the soloists (including him) to the back of the orchestra to sing the choruses and chorales together and introducing a cooperative way of getting to the heart of the work. All very nice in principle but pretty appalling in practice. The result was as faltering as Jesus's steps.",https://theartsdesk.com/classical-music/classical-and-opera-2000-9-highs-and-lows,
838,"La Bohème, Royal Opera",La Bohème,Royal Opera,2009-12-21,Igor Toronyi-Lalic,"Very few of the staged goings-on in Covent Garden’s revival production of La Bohème this weekend rose above the level of mediocrity. The singing was blighted by illness and Eastern European bad habits. The 1970s set was as fresh as a fridge full of condemned meats. The 1970s vision of 19th century costume was extraordinary, as if the set of Abigail's Party had been emptied over the singers' heads. And yet, what an enjoyable evening. In the pit, the never resting hands of the Latvian conductor Andris Nelsons was whipping this warhorse into some sort of damn appealing shape.While the stage creaked and groaned with tiredness and decrepitude, the orchestra beamed with life and energy, drama and modernity, dragging this production into a position of musical (if not theatrical) respectability. From the start, the evocations were bright. When wannabe Delacroix, Marcello, sings of the Red Sea that he is painting overwhelming him “as if showered by spring” Nelsons lifted up the orchestral waters like an ocean swell and let the violins and horns play with our ears. This idea of spring returns again and again as a vision, a hope, to this destitute garret of bohos, most famously in the mind’s eye of Mimi (Hibla Gerzmava) in Act 1. It proved to be a highlight of the night. The vocal competition wasn’t high. The Polish Rodolfo, Piotr Beczala, had flu (and was replaced after the first interval); Kostas Smoriginas’s Colline had dynamic problems; Gabrielle Viviani’s Marcello was nice enough in a chesty sort of way; and Jacques Imbrailo (Schaunard) had an interesting quiver of a voice. But we hadn’t had a truly competent, all-round singer-actor.So all Hibla Gerzmava had to do was what it said on her tin. And how lovely this was when it happened. ""Ma quando vien lo sgelo"" (""But when spring comes"") flowered beautifully, her mature deep sound hugging the orchestral line and pouring out abundantly. This second orchestral evocation of a new life was as beautiful as the fleeting first. Rising up from the pit was a cymbal’s shimmer, the twitter of two flutes and a lazy syncopated string floor. Gerzmava’s first ravishing is orchestral.Her competence, her supreme safeness, in the end, wasn’t all one wanted from the fragile little Mimi. But still, next to the sloppy prattishness of Inna Dukach’s Musetta (deliberate, perhaps), Gerzmava was a godsend - though Dukach’s aria in Café Momus did have one extraordinary thing going for it, a ventriloquist’s sotto voce. Act 2 is dedicated to showing off: vocal, theatrical, dramatic and compositional. Which is fine, if the arrogance has foundations. When it doesn’t – and it didn’t – it soon becomes an act of dramaturgical vomit: a pointless Oliver Twist-like runaround.So we came to Act 3 and a new Rodolfo, Romanian Teodor Illincai, who was worse than the guy he’d just replaced. The first, Beczala (pictured left with Gerzmava), actually had a pretty fine voice in retrospect; he had it all: warmth, energy, control, a frog and a cold.  What Illincai could produce was cleaner but meaner by comparison. And he couldn’t stop semaphoring and thrusting in that typically trite Eastern European way.So it was left to Nelsons to rescue the last two acts. Colour, scenario and drama were now solely in the windmilling hands of the Latvian. The darkness of the broken relationships at the start of Act 4 was summoned up in those stilled tremolandi and misshapen flute duets. Colline’s final act aria was given life by the accompaniment: bassoons, flutes, plucked strings all pacing around in a downcast fashion. And the profound dinginess and deliriousness of the final drama came out in the pungent brass fanfares, and not in the visual whys and wherefores.",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/la-boh%C3%A8me-royal-opera,
839,"Imagine: Placido Domingo - The Time of My Life, BBC One",Imagine: Placido Domingo - The Time of My Life,BBC One,2009-12-15,David Nice,"How old Placido Domingo? Old Placido Domingo in not bad vocal health, to paraphrase Cary Grant's celebrated telegram reply. The other answer depends on your source of reference. Domingo is 68 in the eyes of last night's rather lazy, over-reverent Imagine, but 75 according to my not so New Everyman Dictionary of Music. Where did that come from? It would make him an octogenarian by the time of the date he proudly announced at the programme's end as the furthest-forward in his singer's diary. Perhaps this isn't that much of an issue. There are plenty of others that Alan Yentob might have raised here but didn't.What's clear, and well expressed by Daniel Barenboim if somewhat vaguely and cloyingly by a vacant-looking Franco Zeffirelli and showman Zubin Mehta, is that Domingo has never lost that superabundant vitality and total identification with a role. Before I begin to sound like one of those interviewees, or Yentob himself, I ought to add that the best proof is in the live clips we saw here. Domingo has always given much more on stage than in the recording studio, so it was involving to see old footage of his velvet-to-steel Don José in Carmen under Carlos Kleiber - the only extended excerpt, of the Flower Song - and his Covent Garden Otello in agonising close-up rather than the dubbed (and abridged) Zeffirelli version. There was also just about enough of Ernani to tell us why he would have been hailed as a worthy Verdian tenor on his 1969 Milan debut in the title role.Surely more shattering operatic events have happened in recent decades than the - o, meraviglia! - synchronised Tosca live in locations around Rome. It was a fine achievement, but from the way Yentob (who managed to tell us he was head of BBC Two at the time) talked about it, you'd think that the whole project had discovered a musical holy grail.Domingo began to get interesting as he recalled cracking around a G natural or an A flat when he started singing Wagner's Lohengrin at the age of 27. He laid the blame on over-coaching. Why? If Yentob asked, it didn't survive the editing process. Nor were any questions raised of the once-perceived failure to hit the Pavarotti jackpot of the golden top notes, or any details given of why or how Domingo progressed from baritone to tenor and is now, as Verdi's Simon Boccanegra, moving back down again (though again Barenboim came briefly to the rescue with a little chapter and verse).The spadework on Domingo's early years in Spain and Mexico was decent enough, and it was good to hear how accomplished his mother was as a singer of the Spanish light-opera form known as zarzuela. There was a charming sequence in which his sons, including Placi Domingo the Third, all participated in karaoke. His involvement in the Mexican earthquake, launched by personal tragedy, seems as admirable now as it did in 1985. And the launch of the Operalia festival for younger singers surely stems from the best of motives. Yet once again Yentob had to go and spoil it all by flashing back 50 years to the young Domingo's appearance with the veteran Lily Pons and affecting a certain wryness as he said to Domingo, ""I sense from that moment you felt the need to pass the baton on.""I sense nothing of the sort. It's needling to be put on the defensive by such a hagiographic approach. Because it probably is true, after all, that no tenor has ever acted with such ferocious intensity combined with handsomeness of stage presence. ""Placid Sunday"", as the show wasted no time in telling us the name translates, he never has been, and never will be; but this programme was about as placid Sundayish as they come.Domingo sings The Flower Song from Carmen:",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/imagine-placido-domingo-time-my-life-bbc-one,

841,"Der Rosenkavalier, Royal Opera",Der Rosenkavalier,Royal Opera,2009-12-07,David Nice,"Seeking the snows of yesteryear, I remember a time when John Schlesinger's Covent Garden Rosenkavalier filled every moment of Hugo von Hofmannsthal's rococo libretto and Richard Strauss's jewel-studded score with life and meaning. 25 years on, its creator is no more, a revival director (Andrew Sinclair) fails to pull a dramatically variable cast together and many startling new productions have shown more readiness to engage with the opera's Viennese time machine - that's to say, any era between the 1740s and the present day - and with greater panache.A strictly period setting can still be managed (David McVicar worked humane wonders with a stylised 18th century for Scottish Opera, Opera North and ENO). Schlesinger has bequeathed a wealth of Hogarthian detail, and the late Maria Bjørnson's startling costumes hint at the hyper-real (as well as the aspirations of nouveau-riche Faninal, within William Dudley's pointedly over-the-top Vienna townhouse). It's just that despite the mostly fiery pace of Kirill Petrenko's conducting, stage energy needs to fill swathes of the action and several experienced singers turn in unfocused characterisations.This ought to be an opera thrusting home the cruelty of passing time, woman's powerlessness in the face of man the hunter, and above all what an affair with a teenager means to a grand lady coming to terms with the ageing process. But as neither of these two characters, the thirtysomething Marschallin and the 17-year old Octavian, was convincingly inhabited by Soile Isokoski and Sophie Koch (pictured together right in Act 1), the work could well have reverted to the title Strauss and Hofmannsthal originally intended for it, Ochs auf Lerchenau, stressing the city shenanigans of an aristocratic chancer from the Upper Austrian countryside. It could also have taken its name from an old French romantic novel, The Misfortunes of Sophie, for it was unique in my experience to end up caring more about young Sophie von Faninal than for the older woman.This was down to an extraordinarily active and deeply felt performance from Lucy Crowe. Her awestruck reception of the silver rose before she has even had a chance to fall in love with its bearer floated effortlessly in the ether, bringing tears to the eyes as the rather stolidly presented predicament of Isokoski's Marschallin at the end of the previous act had not. In the famous trio, it was Crowe's voice which rode the horn-laden waves of orchestral sound, at least from where I was sitting (Royal Opera acoustics can be capricious).In terms of filling in any of the revival's potential blank spaces, Crowe was equalled by Peter Rose (pictured with her, left) as the lord of misrule who comes to claim her for her family fortunes, Baron Ochs. Rose has now sung this enormous role all over the world, accepted even in notoriously hard-to-please Vienna as the real comic article. Not only is his discreet dialect spot on, as an Austrian assured me; he actually sings the part, as many older basses do not, rather beautifully, with the occasional aristocratic aplomb. He has learnt to fill the characterisation with a thousand gestures, and his shtick in the famous waltzing letter scene is just on the right side of robust - though the low money note at the end eluded him, just as Crowe faltered in the test of her perilous final ascent. Notewise, both singers were otherwise flawless.You couldn't really fault Koch's music-making either. The French mezzo has the flaming top for the impetuous youngster - written as a soprano role - though the rest can sometimes be too trumpet-like for silky comfort. Dramatically, though, she expressed little if anything of this second Cherubino's insecurity or deeper tenderness, and her masquerade as the Marschallin's chamber maid - girl plays boy plays girl - was unfunny; it often is, but it needn't be.Isokoski provided the most disconcerting blank of the evening. Civic sophistication had clearly not left its mark on the Feldmarschall's once-inexperienced wife. Projecting the text with rather adenoidal emphasis in the lower register, not quite matched to a luminous if sometimes fluttery top,  she just about got away with the humour of the opening scenes but missed all the emotional targets in the soliloquy and later the monologues of passing time. That the end of this great scene was moving at all could only be ascribed to the chamber-musical sensitivity of Petrenko's orchestra. As the final dilemma of compromise and disappointment took over from the Viennese farce of the third act, we felt sorrier for the dashing of Ochs's dreams as sombrely suggested by Rose, and then happier for the success of Crowe's Sophie. The Marschallin's less than gracious and hardly emotionally charged exit raised no frisson by comparison.Among Hofmannsthal's gallery of supporting grotesques, Faninal hardly came across as a father with dangerously high blood pressure in Thomas Allen's surprisingly muted portrayal. Yet while Wookyung Kim made an unItalian tenor, the Latin intriguers were well etched with the experience of Graham Clark and Leah Marian Jones. The truly small parts were taken by a mixture of sleek young singers and unruly oldtimers (the Marschallin's footmen, disorderly as so often). Ultimately, nothing on stage knitted as well as it did down in the orchestra. This was a fine night for Petrenko, Crowe and Rose. Unfortunately, since the public's sympathy must move with the rose-bearer of the title and ultimately with his reflective older mistress, that wasn't enough.OVERLEAF: MORE RICHARD STRAUSS ON THEARTSDESK",https://theartsdesk.com/opera/der-rosenkavalier-royal-opera,
